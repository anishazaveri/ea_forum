Here, we present the results of a randomized controlled trial of dietary supplementation in humans with an emphasis on randomized control trials. Results We randomized 11 male rats (9 males and 2 females) to a two-week dietary supplementation program. The diets were composed of 5 servings of 1,4-DHA (DHA) and 6.5-DHA, and the animals were randomly assigned to receive either 2- or 3-DHA/DHA supplementation. After an 8-week period, all rats (9 males) received daily supplementation for 12 weeks (or 6 months). In addition, 15-min food periods were followed up to 6 months. While the researchers reported a significant positive effect on the group that received both daily supplementation and weekly

What is Rationality in AI?
Background Rationality is an ideology of AI, a belief system based on the belief that humans are naturally sentient. It argues that all human actions are responsible for the wellbeing of all sentient beings. This view is based on a large body of evidence. It is not a new, classicist theory of AI. Instead it is a mixture of old and new philosophy. In some cases it is viewed as ‘scientific’ (in particular, the ‘key facts’). In other cases it is viewed as ‘principles of AI’ (in particular, the 'principles’ of ‘intelligence’). But in some cases it is viewed as an alternate way of

GITC's Vaccination Prevention Research Project
This is the first post of a three part series on the development of effective vaccines. This series will start with a list of possible vaccines that can be developed by the GPI team, ending with a brief overview of the science behind vaccine development. We will then address a variety of questions in the areas of biosecurity, biosecurity technologies and improved vaccine safety.This is a work in progress and we hope to get back to you soon. If you enjoyed this post, please share it to any social media channels you have.  Introduction to vaccines We’re excited to announce that GPI’s Vaccination Prevention Research Project (VPR) has been successful. Here

Altruism: Rationality in Human Suffering
This is an optional intro to a shorter post about rationality. I’m a relatively new reviewer, so I’d be interested to hear your thoughts on the topic.I hope you’re well-informed, though I’m also just slightly confused about the “mainstream” model of rationality. I’m sure there’s some kind of disagreement about it, and I’m worried it could make it worse. My own thoughts: I think rationality itself is an “impartiality” model, that is, we have to be “rational” in order to be rational.Some terms I’m not

TL;DR's for the EA Forum/Welcome: ”Effective altruists are trying to figure out how to build a more effective AI, using paperclips, but we're not really sure how it's possible to do so. An outside view of this possibility is that most effective altruists will throw their lot in with the AI development team, and don't think EA has much time to invest in long-term thinking. However, most effective altruists have some faith that EA can do this, and feel there's a chance that some EA org can do this, and would be able to contribute some impact. So, they're focusing on trying to figure out how to make an impact. We now have a list of projects: 

The research team at Berkeley Lab is planning to conduct a long-term, randomized controlled trial of meditation to see if it can help people in the short-term with mental health. A preliminary study will follow a few months. We think it is very promising, and will conduct an independent, controlled trial.  Meditation is not only effective in helping people with mental health problems, but it is also useful for those suffering from depression, anxiety, or other chronic conditions. We are also doing a study on the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation for anxiety, and we are excited to see how it will work for people with these conditions.    To help you with this research, we are going to be launching a very small group of volunteers with our grants to

Effective altruism is a wonderful way to think about our future. It is part of a massive evolutionary puzzle. But it is the best answer to the question of how to survive and thrive in a world where our ancestors are so powerful and mysterious. I have written up a series of recent work on effective altruism. If you like what I do, please consider subscribing to my newsletter. You can also consider subscribing to my podcast, where I discuss my thoughts on every new thing. This is a great way to keep up with all the latest developments in effective altruism, even if you are not yet an active member of the effective altruism community.

Make the world a better place, don’t create an alternative universe, and save the planet by donating to effective charities!
Should we be considering making the Pledge of Giving or an optional one?
The Pledge of Giving is a pledge that is in addition to the standard pledge. If you are unsure about what you should do, please write a post explaining what you think, and include an email address.   If you feel like you should give away your money, please contact the GiveWell team.   If you think you should not donate, please contact the GiveWell team.   How should I get started?
   
   
I’ve been asked to write up an in-depth analysis of the likely implications of an AI safety policy. There is a number of issues to consider, but here are a few that we’ve covered that may be important.A common misconception is that we’re going to have a perpetual risk of AI safety. This is often linked to the word “no-one knows” (“no-one knows”“AI safety is not a thing”). A closer look at the same claims would show that they are almost never about no-one knowing. In fact, the word “no-one knows“ is used to describe a state of affairs of the universe. I would
   
What is effective altruism? Effective altruism is an effective altruism movement founded in 1973 by philosopher E. G. W. Bostrom. It is a scientific movement with a commitment to evidence-based philosophy.    

We are providing $10,000 to support a new startup that creates advanced AI hardware that will lead to artificial general intelligence, in partnership with the AI Alignment Project. We believe that by creating a hardware platform that is as robust and as efficient as possible, we can get the most out of AI hardware development, in a cost-effective way.We are also funding the Open Philanthropy Project, which is a new foundation founded by a former researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), to support research on machine learning and artificial general intelligence research. We are currently funding the Open Philanthropy Project to cover its costs of the research, and will also provide a portion of the funding for the AI Alignment Project. (
