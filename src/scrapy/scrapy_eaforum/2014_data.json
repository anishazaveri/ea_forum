What claims does it make? What do you have to believe or do, to be an Effective Altruist?</em></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think that any of these questions make sense.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not surprising that we ask them: if you asked those questions about feminism or secularism, Islamism or libertarianism, the answers you would get would be relevant and illuminating. Different proponents of the same movement might give you slightly different answers, but synthesising the answers of several people would give you a pretty good feeling for the core of the movement.</p>\n<p>But each of these movements is <em>answering </em>a question. Should men and women be equal? (Yes.) What role should the church play in governance? (None.) What kind of government should we have? (One based on Islamic law.) How big a role should government play in people\u2019s private lives? (A small one.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>Effective Altruism isn\u2019t like this. Effective Altruism is <em>asking </em>a question, something like:\u00a0</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cHow can I do the most good, with the resources available to me?\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/13/effective-altruism/\">some</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://effectivealtruism.org/\">excellent</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/03/what-is-an-effective-altruist/\">introductions</a> to Effective Altruism out there. They often outline common conclusions that Effective-Altruism-style thinking leads to: things like <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/earning-to-give/\">earning to give</a>, or favouring interventions in <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas\">poorer countries</a> over those in richer countries. This makes sense - Effective Altruism does seem to imply that those things are a good idea - but it doesn't make the conclusions part of the core of the movement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"What_does_this_mean_for_how_we_think_and_talk_about_Effective_Altruism_\">What does this mean for how we think and talk about Effective Altruism?</h2>\n<p>Reframing Effective Altruism as a question has some pretty significant implications. These aren\u2019t necessarily new \u2013 some people already act on the points below. But I think they are worth thinking about explicitly.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"1__We_should_try_to_avoid_calling_ourselves__effective_altruists_\">1. We should try to avoid calling ourselves \u201ceffective altruists\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>Feminist, secularist, Islamist, environmentalist... it\u2019s not surprising that people who think Effective Altruism is interesting and important want to switch the \u201c-ism\u201d into an \u201c-ist\u201d, and use it to refer to themselves. The linguistic part of our brain does it automatically.</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s a big problem with this. \u201cEffective Altruism\u201d is a carefully and cleverly chosen name, and it describes its own core question succinctly. But it does this by combining a common adjective with a common noun, which means that changing the last syllable gives you not an identifier, but a truth claim.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am an effective altruist\u201d may sound to the speaker like \u201cI think Effective Altruism is really important\u201d, but to the listener, it sounds like \u201cI perform selfless acts in a manner that is successful, efficient, fruitful or efficacious.\u201d (Thesauruses are fun!)</p>\n<p>Effective Altruism is already a slightly impudent name, since its claim to be a ground-breaking idea rests on the premise that other altruism is ineffective.</p>\n<p>Calling oneself an effective altruist is much worse. As well as provoking scepticism or hostility, it automatically leads into questions like \u201cCan I [x] and still be an effective altruist?\u201d \u201cHow much do I have to donate to be an effective altruist?\u201d \u201cHow does an effective altruist justify spending money on anything beyond bare survival?\u201d These questions feel like they should have meaningful answers, but trying to answer them <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/np/disputing_definitions/\">probably won't get us very far</a>.</p>\n<p>Alternative descriptors include \u201caspiring effective altruist\u201d, \u201cinterested in Effective Altruism\u201d, \u201cmember of the Effective Altruism movement\u201d\u2026 What do you think of those options? Do you have others? When could it still be appropriate to use \u201ceffective altruist\u201d?</p>\n<p><strong id=\"2__Our_suggested_actions_and_causes_are_best_guesses__not_core_ideas\">2. Our suggested actions and causes are best guesses, not core ideas</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s extremely important that Effective Altruism does get translated into actions in the real world. To date, the most concrete of concrete suggestions come from <a href=\"http://givewell.org\">GiveWell</a>, in the form of charity recommendations. GiveWell itself is extremely good at revising its recommendations in line with the best information and analysis available to them. They never claim that cash transfers or deworming are part of their key agenda.</p>\n<p>Effective Altruism enthusiasts who support common EA causes like animal rights, extreme poverty reduction or the welfare of future generations need to keep this in the back of their minds. It is not coincidental that these causes are prominent within Effective Altruism \u2013 each does seem to offer significant opportunities to do good.</p>\n<p>But they can only be so prominent while they appear to be areas where a great positive impact can be made. As soon as our understanding of what can best make the world a better place changes, our actions and priorities must also change.</p>\n<p>This also means that...</p>\n<p><strong id=\"3__We_can_honestly_tell_others_that_we_want_to_be_persuaded_that_their_cause_is_better\">3. We can honestly tell others that we want to be persuaded that their cause is better</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s very tempting, having found the Effective Altruism movement, to think that you have discovered the Way To Fix The World and need only share it with others to make everything better. But this just isn\u2019t the case.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t know how to think about political change. We can\u2019t measure the long term effects of increased education for poor children. We have no good way to compare the potential gains from researching cures with the immediate gains of treatment.</p>\n<p>So when someone new to Effective Altruism starts talking about the cause they find most important \u2013 especially if it\u2019s someone you think is thoughtful and intelligent \u2013 don\u2019t brush it off, or tell them that the Best Thing To Do has already been found and their thing is <a href=\"/ea/7x/supportive_scepticism/\">obviously worse</a>. Ask them about it!</p>\n<p>It\u2019s really unusual for someone who supports a movement to actively want to <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/jy/avoiding_your_beliefs_real_weak_points/\">change their mind</a>. But that\u2019s the position that every aspiring Effective Altruist is in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyone who can help us answer the question we care most about is a valuable ally. We can and should tell anyone who disagrees with our object-level beliefs that we really, truly want to be persuaded to think otherwise. This will not only make it easier for them to take us seriously - it will also increase the chances that we direct our efforts well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>In short:</strong> thinking of Effective Altruism as a question rather than a particular set of beliefs or policies has some interesting and useful implications. It makes questions of what \u201ccounts\u201d as an Effective Altruist or an Effective Altruism organisation moot \u2013 if you\u2019re honestly trying to figure out how to do the most good, that\u2019s that. It shows that Effective Altruism isn't all about donating to health interventions in Africa. It reminds us that we still don't really know how to be effective altruists.</p>\n<p>I can imagine a hypothetical future in which I don\u2019t agree with the set of people that <a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.paulgraham.com%2Fidentity.html&amp;ei=mdQ8VJS7NY3W8gXm_4K4CA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEkETv7iiXCaMdIVvn0FxIBhW1iww&amp;sig2=efMJoYTspsiafZiaKlxMwg&amp;bvm=bv.77161500,d.dGc\">identify</a> with the \u201cEA movement\u201d. But I can\u2019t imagine a future where I\u2019m not trying to figure out how to answer the question \"How can I do the most good?\"</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "26th Sep 2014", "title": "Effective altruism as the most exciting cause in the world", "author": "Kaj_Sotala", "num_comments": "11 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>I feel that one thing that effective altruists haven't sufficiently capitalized on in their marketing is just how amazingly <em>exciting</em> the whole thing is. There's Holden Karnofsky's post on <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/20/excited-altruism/\">excited altruism</a>, but it doesn't really go into the details of <em>why</em>\u00a0effective altruism is so exciting. So let me try to fix that.</p>\n<p>Growing up, it felt like the message I got from society was: one person just can't do much. The problems in the world are huge and structural, and naive reformers will eventually just become disillusioned and burn out. We can try to make small efforts in our personal lives, but they're tiny and won't scale.</p>\n<p>Effective altruism says that this doesn't need to be true! Yes, some of the problems are huge and structural, but that doesn't mean that individuals can't have a big impact. The average person working in an ordinary job can potentially save several lives a year, just by donating a <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/what-you-can-achieve\">measly 10% of his income</a> and doing literally <em>nothing</em> else altruistic! That would already be amazing by itself.</p>\n<p>But it doesn't end there. Effective altruism says that, if you focus on the right career, you can have an even bigger impact! And the careers don't even need to be exotic, demanding ones that only a few select ones can do (even if some of them are). Some of the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/research/top-careers/\">top potential careers</a> that 80,000 hours has identified so far include thing as diverse as being an academic, civil servant, journalist, marketer, politician, or software engineer, among others. Not only that, they also emphasize <em>finding your fit</em>. To have a big impact on the world, you don't need to shoehorn yourself into a role that doesn't suit you and that you hate - in fact you're explicitly <em>encouraged</em> to find an high-impact career that <em>fits you personally</em>.</p>\n<p>Analytic? Maybe consider research, in one form or another. Want to mostly support the cause from the side, not thinking about things too much? Let the existing charity evaluation organizations guide who you donate to and don't worry about the rest. Or help out other effective altruists. People person? Plenty of ways you could have an impact. There's always <em>something</em> you can do - and still be effective. It's not about needing to be superhuman, it's about doing the best that you can, <em>given your personality, talents and interests</em>.</p>\n<p>Best of all? This isn't just some fuzzy feelgood thing where you're taking things on faith. People in the community are constantly debating these things, looking for ways to improve and to become even better at doing good. If you have even the slightest inclination, you're encouraged to participate and refine the ideas. If you spot a crucial flaw in someone else's argument, or suggest a critical improvement, it may impact the effectiveness of all the other effective altruists who are doing or thinking about doing something related.</p>\n<p>Here's an extra bonus. At the moment, the core of effective altruism is formed of smart, driven, and caring people from all around the world. When you become an effective altruist and start participating, you are joining a community of some of the most interesting people on Earth.</p>\n<p>A lot of people feel like life is meaningless, and that it doesn't offer any purpose that would feel worth pursuing. I've felt like that at times, too. But it's hard to find a purpose whose idea would be more compelling, exciting, or rewarding than that of effective altruism.</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "18th Sep 2014", "title": "Supportive Scepticism", "author": "Jess_Whittlestone", "num_comments": "21 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>I\u2019d like to raise an aspect of effective altruism that I personally find difficult. My hope is that this will promote discussion and help others who feel similarly.</p>\n<p>I want to preface this by saying I am incredibly glad that I got involved in the effective altruism community, and that I think overall my life is a lot better because of it. I feel like I have a much greater sense of purpose and belief that I can do good in the world, I have an incredible network of friends with similar values and interests, and a great deal more ambition. Plus I\u2019m actually doing more to make the world better, of course.</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s also something about EA that causes me a distress I didn\u2019t have before.</p>\n<p>The whole point of effective altruism is that we don\u2019t just want to do good; we want to do the most good possible. But figuring out the \u201cbest possible\u201d thing for any person to do is incredibly difficult. And a strong desire to do the best possible thing coupled with a huge amount of uncertainty is a recipe for\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/stress\">dissatisfaction</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_first_part_of_the_problem_is_that_it_s_easy_to_put_a_lot_of_pressure_on_yourself_as_an_effective_altruist_\">The first part of the problem is that it\u2019s easy to put a lot of pressure on yourself as an effective altruist.</h2>\n<p>I personally spend a lot of time thinking about whether what I\u2019m doing right now really is the best thing, or whether I could be doing something better. And whilst some doubt and scepticism is definitely useful, I can\u2019t help but think I\u2019m doubting myself more than is useful. It seems quite likely I would be happier and more effective in what I\u2019m doing if I doubted myself less. At the very least, I\u2019d simply be doing more things. I spend far too much of my time in analysis paralysis.</p>\n<p>To give a concrete example: I\u2019ve just finished my first year of a PhD program. And I\u2019ve spent a good proportion of that first year agonising with myself over the question: \u201cWhat should my thesis topic be?\u201d. Every time someone suggested a topic or I thought about narrowing down on an area a little voice in my head would go \u201cBut what if that\u2019s not the best thing for you to research? What if this other thing was better?\u201d. You can see how this kind of thinking might start to drive you crazy, and how it might also lead me to feel quite unmotivated to work on my PhD.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Part_two_of_the_problem_is_that_it_s_also_easy_to_end_up_putting_a_lot_of_pressure_on_each_other_\">Part two of the problem is that it\u2019s also easy to end up putting a lot of pressure on each other.</h2>\n<p>One of the key parts of effective altruism is that we don\u2019t take claims of do-gooding at face value: just because something sounds like it does good, or produces a warm glow, doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s actually doing good. So every time we hear about some kind of altruistic endeavour, we automatically think, \u201cBut is that really effective?\u201d. This also happens when we talk to each other about our plans. When I\u2019m telling another effective altruist about what I\u2019m working on or what my long-term plan is, there\u2019s often that niggling voice in the back of my head going, \u201cI wonder if they\u2019re thinking this isn\u2019t very effective and judging me....\u201d. This can also make us appear unwelcoming to people who are new to the ideas of effective altruism. Unfortunately scepticism and warmth just don\u2019t seem to be that well correlated.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in worrying about this - I\u2019ve spoken to a number of other effective altruists who experience something similar. It seems like quite a few people worry about not being \u201ceffective enough\u201d or \u201cnot doing enough good\u201d more than is helpful. And I think this is actually a pretty big problem. It may be stopping people from making as much difference as they could. It may also be preventing us from being as warm and encouraging towards each other as we could be, especially towards people new to the ideas of effective altruism.</p>\n<h2 id=\"So_what_can_we_do_about_this_\">So what can we do about this?</h2>\n<p>The crux of the problem seems to be that it\u2019s difficult to be sceptical and supportive: both of other people, and of ourselves. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an inevitable consequence of being sceptical that we\u2019ll end up putting pressure on ourselves and others.</p>\n<p>I think one thing that\u2019s useful in itself is just for people to admit that they feel this pressure sometimes. Hearing that other people feel the way I do - that other people worry about whether they\u2019re doing the best thing, and worry about what others think of them - helped me to realise that it wasn\u2019t just me, and accept that what I was feeling was natural. That\u2019s a big part of the reason I\u2019m writing this post: so people who feel this way, even a little bit, can realise that it may be a pretty common feeling. I\u2019d be really interested to hear from people the extent to which they can identify with what they described, to know how common it is. Obviously if you don\u2019t feel this way, that\u2019s great - maybe you have some great strategies or ways of thinking those of us who do can use!</p>\n<p>The next step is for us to just make sure we are being kind and encouraging - both towards each other and ourselves. We could also reward this behaviour so it becomes more of a community norm. I find actually trying to change my patterns of thought really useful - it\u2019s so easy to get into the habit of thinking hypercritically every time you hear a claim. Now, when I hear a new idea from someone, I try to think about what it\u2019s virtues might be instead of/as well as thinking of ways it might be improved (note: improved, not wrong.) Mental habits are <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/ita/how_habits_work_and_how_you_may_control_them/\">relatively malleable</a> if you practice.</p>\n<h2 id=\"To_conclude_\">To conclude:</h2>\n<p>Being kind and being sceptical aren't mutually exclusive, but it's easy to end up feeling like they are. When we think of incredibly warm and kind people, they tend to be the kind of people who will say any idea is wonderful. Of course, this is exactly what effective altruism is trying to oppose: we don't want to lose our habits of rigorously examining arguments and evidence. But just as important is ensuring we don't go too far in the other direction; that we don't become cold towards each other and ourselves. If we can't suspend our scepticism for long enough to make decisions, or listen to someone else's plans without immediately writing them off, then we're unlikely to get very far.</p></div></div>"},

strong and I am skeptical, but I do think it's strong enough to be worth considering, and I'm probably going to make some minor life changes based on it.</em></p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Chances are that if you're reading this post, you're probably a bit weird in some way.</p>\n<p>No offense, of course. \u00a0In fact, I actually mean it as a compliment. \u00a0Weirdness is <em>incredibly important</em>. \u00a0If people weren't willing to deviate from society and hold weird beliefs, we wouldn't have had the important social movements that ended slavery and pushed back against racism, that created democracy, that expanded social roles for women, and that made the world a better place in numerous other ways.</p>\n<p>Many things we take for granted now as why our current society as great were once...\u00a0<em>weird</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Joseph Overton theorized that\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window\">policy develops through six stages</a>:\u00a0<em>unthinkable</em>, then\u00a0<em>radical</em>, then\u00a0<em>acceptable</em>, then<em>\u00a0sensible</em>, then\u00a0<em>popular</em>, then\u00a0<em>actual policy.</em>\u00a0\u00a0We could see this happen with many policies -- currently same-sex marriage is making its way from popular to actual policy, but not to long ago it was merely acceptable, and not too long before that it was pretty radical.</p>\n<p>Some good ideas are currently in the <em>radical</em><em>\u00a0</em>range.\u00a0 Effective altruism itself is such a collection of beliefs typical people would consider pretty radical. \u00a0Many people think donating 3% of their income is a lot, let alone the 10% demand that Giving What We Can places, or the 50%+ that some people in the community do.</p>\n<p>And that's not all. \u00a0Others would suggest that <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3s/why_eat_less_meat/\">everyone become vegetarian</a>, advocating for <a href=\"http://www.openborders.info\">open borders</a> and/or <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/08/a-something-sort-of-like-left-libertarianism-ist-manifesto/\">universal basic income</a>,

world a better place if made into policy, all of these ideas are pretty <em>weird</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Weirdness, of course, is a drawback. \u00a0People take weird opinions less seriously.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/j4/absurdity_heuristic_absurdity_bias/\">The absurdity heuristic</a> is a real bias that people -- even you -- have. \u00a0If an idea sounds <em>weird </em>to you, you're less likely to try and believe it, <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/2d/talking_snakes_a_cautionary_tale/\">even if there's overwhelming evidence</a>. \u00a0And <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof\">social proof</a> matters -- if less people believe something, people will be less likely to believe it. \u00a0Lastly, don't forget\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect\">the halo effect</a> -- if one part of you seems weird, the rest of you will seem weird too!</p>\n<p>(<strong>Update:\u00a0</strong>apparently this concept is, itself, already known to social psychology as\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncrasy_credit\">idiosyncrasy credits</a>. \u00a0Thanks,\u00a0<a href=\"/lw/lbn/you_have_a_set_amount_of_weirdness_points_spend/bogz?context=3\">Mr. Commenter</a>!)</p>\n<p>...But we can use this knowledge to our advantage. \u00a0The halo effect can work in reverse -- if we're normal in many ways, our weird beliefs will seem more normal too. \u00a0If we have a notion of weirdness as a kind of currency that we have a limited supply of, we can spend it wisely, without looking like a crank.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All of this leads to the following actionable principles:</p>\n<p><strong>Recognize you only have a few \"weirdness points\" to spend. \u00a0</strong>Trying to convince all your friends to donate 50% of their income to MIRI, become a vegan, get a cryonics plan, and demand open borders will be met with a lot of resistance. \u00a0 But -- I hypothesize -- that if you pick one of these ideas and push it, you'll have a lot more success.</p>\n<p><strong>Spend your weirdness points effectively. \u00a0</strong>Perhaps it's really important that people advocate for open borders. \u00a0But, perhaps, getting people to donate to developing world health would overall do more good. \u00a0In that case, I'd focus on moving donations to the developing world and leave open borders alone, even though it is really important. \u00a0You should triage your weirdness effectively the same way you would triage your donations.</p>\n<p><strong>Clean up and look good. \u00a0</strong>Lookism is a problem in society, and I wish people could look \"weird\" and still be socially acceptable. \u00a0But if you're a guy wearing a dress in public, or some punk rocker vegan advocate, recognize that you're spending your weirdness points fighting lookism, which means less weirdness points to spend promoting veganism or something else.</p>\n<p><strong>Advocate for more \"normal\" policies that are almost as good. \u00a0 </strong>Of course, allocating your \"weirdness points\" on a few issues doesn't mean you have to stop advocating for other important issues -- just consider being less weird about it. \u00a0Perhaps universal basic income truly would be a very effective policy to help the poor in the United States. \u00a0But <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/7/29/5946395/eitc-poverty-supplemental-measure-official-threshold\">reforming the earned income tax credit</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/11/12/7193609/zoning-wage-stagnation\">relaxing zoning laws</a>\u00a0would also both do a lot to help the poor in the US, and such suggestions aren't weird.</p>\n<p><strong>Use the foot-in-door technique and the door-in-face technique. \u00a0</strong>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique\">foot-in-door technique</a> involves starting with a small ask and gradually building up the ask, such as suggesting people donate a little bit effectively, and then gradually get them to take the Giving What We Can Pledge. \u00a0The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-in-the-face_technique\">door-in-face technique</a> involves making a big ask (e.g., join Giving What We Can) and then substituting it for a smaller ask, like the Life You Can Save pledge or Try Out Giving.</p>\n<p><strong>Reconsider effective altruism's clustering of beliefs. \u00a0</strong>Right now, effective altruism is associated strongly with donating a lot of money and donating effectively, less strongly with impact in career choice, veganism, and existential risk. \u00a0Of course, I'm not saying that we should drop some of these memes completely. \u00a0But maybe EA should disconnect a bit more and compartmentalize -- for example, leaving AI risk to MIRI, for example, and not talk about it much, say, on 80,000 Hours. \u00a0And maybe instead of asking people to both give more AND give more effectively, we could focus more exclusively on asking people to donate what they already do more effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluate the above with more research. \u00a0</strong>While I think the evidence base behind this is decent, it's not great and I haven't spent that much time developing it. \u00a0I think we should look into this more with a review of the relevant literature and some careful, targeted, market research on the individual beliefs within effective altruism (how weird are they?) and how they should be connected or left disconnected. \u00a0Maybe this has already been done some?</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p><em>Also <a

{"date": "15th Oct 2014", "title": "On Progress and Prosperity", "author": "Paul_Christiano", "num_comments": "33 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>I often encounter the following argument, or a variant of it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Historically, technological, economic, and social progress have been associated with significant gains in quality of life and significant improvement in society's ability to cope with challenges. All else equal, these trends should be expected to continue, and so contributions to technological, economic, and social progress should be expected to be very valuable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I encounter this argument from a wide range of perspectives, including most of the social circles I interact with other than the LessWrong community (academics, friends from school, philanthropists, engineers in the bay area). For example, Holden Karnofsky writes about the general positive effects of progress <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">here</a>\u00a0(I agree with many of these points). I think that similar reasoning informs people's views more often than it is actually articulated.</p>\n<p><strong>I disagree with this argument</strong>. This disagreement appears to be responsible for many of my other contrarian views, and to have significant consequences for my altruistic priorities; I discuss some concrete consequences at the end of the post. (The short summary is that I consider differential intellectual progress to be an order of magnitude more important than absolute intellectual progress.) In the body of this post I want to make my position as clear as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My impression is that I disagree with the conventional view because (1) I take the long-term perspective much more seriously than most people, (2) I have thought at more length about this question than most people. But overall I remain a bit hesitant in this view due to its unpopularity. Note that my view is common in the LessWrong crowd and has been argued for elsewhere. In general I endorse significant skepticism for views which are common amongst LessWrong but unpopular in the wider world (though I think this one is unusually solid).</p>\n<h1 id=\"Values\">Values</h1>\n<p>I suspect that one reason I disagree with conventional wisdom is that I consider the welfare of individual future people to be nearly as valuable as the welfare of existing people, and consequently the collective welfare of future people to be <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxuYmVja3N0ZWFkfGd4OjExNDBjZTcwNjMxMzRmZGE\">substantially more important</a> than the welfare of existing people.</p>\n<p>In particular, I think the original argument is accurate--and a dominant consideration--if we restrict our attention to people living over the next 100 years, and perhaps even the next 500 years. (Incidentally, most serious intellectuals appear to consider it unreasonable to have a view that discriminates between \"Good for the people living over the next 500 years\" and \"Good for people overall.\")</p>\n<p>Some people who raise this argument consider the welfare of far future people to be of dubious or reduced moral value. But many people who raise this argument purport to share a long-term, risk-neutral, aggregative perspective. I think that this latter group is making an empirical error, which is what I want to address here.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, I hope that in the future the EA crowd adopts a more reasonable compromise between long-term, species-agnostic, risk-neutral utilitarianism, and more normal-looking intuitions that by behaving morally we can collectively make all of our lives much better. It seems most EA's grant that there is a place for selfishness, but often reject conventional behaviors which collectively benefit the modern developed world.</p>\n<p>I think that part of the resistance to anti-progress arguments comes from the desire to recover conventional pro-social behavior, without explicit recognition of that goal.</p>\n<h1 id=\"This_is_a_painful_disagreement\">This is a painful disagreement</h1>\n<p>This is a painful disagreement for me for two reasons.</p>\n<p><strong>First</strong>, I believe that society at large <em>substantially</em>\u00a0underestimates the welfare gains from economic and technological progress. Indeed, I think that given an exclusive concern for the next few generations, these should probably be overwhelming concerns of a would-be altruist. I could talk at length about this view and the errors which I think underly conventional views, but it would be a digression.</p>\n<p>In light of this, I find it extremely unpleasant to find myself on the anti-progress side of almost any argument. First, because I think that someone sensible who learns my position will rationally assume that I am guilty of the most common errors responsible for the position, rather than making a heroically charitable assumption. Second, I have a visceral desire to argue for what I think is right (I hear the call of someone being wrong on the internet), and in most everyday discussions that means arguing for the merits of technological and economic progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Second</strong>, I think that pursuing plans which result in substantially slower growth comes at a material expense for the people alive today, and especially for their children and grandchildren. For the same reason that I would be uncomfortable hurting those around me for personal advantage, I am uncomfortable hurting those around me in the service of utilitarian ends (a problem much exacerbated by the erosion of the act-omission distinction).</p>\n<p>[In fact I mostly do try to be a nice guy; in part this is due to the good effects of not-being-a-jerk (which are often substantial), but it's also largely due to a softening of the aggregate-utilitarian perspective and a decision-theoretic view partially calibrated to reproduce intuitions about what we ought to do.]</p>\n<h1 id=\"Why_I_disagree\">Why I disagree</h1>\n<p>For reference, the argument in question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Historically, technological, economic, and social progress have been associated with significant gains in quality of life and significant improvement in society's ability to cope with challenges. All else equal, these trends should be expected to continue, and so contributions to technological, economic, and social progress should be considered highly valuable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"_Meta_\">[Meta]</h3>\n<p>This is an instance of the general schema \"In the past we have observed an association between X [progress] and Y [goodness]. This suggests that X is generally associated with Y, and in particular that this future instance of X will be associated with Y.\"</p>\n<p>I have no problem with this schema in general, nor with this argument in particular. One way of responding to such an argument is to offer a clear explanation of why X and Y have been associated in the observed cases. This then screens off the evidence about the general association of X with Y; if the clear explanation doesn't predict that X and Y will be associated in the future, this undermines the predicted association.</p>\n<h3 id=\"_Object_level_\">[Object level]</h3>\n<p>In this case, it seems clear that greater technological capabilities at time T lead to improved quality of life at time T. This is a very simple observation, robustly supported by the historical record. Moreover, it is also clear that improved technological capabilities at time T lead to improved technological capabilities at time T+1. And I could make similar statements for economic progress, and arguably for social progress.</p>\n<p>Once we accept this, we have a clear explanation of why faster progress leads to improvements in quality of life. There is no mysterious correlation to be explained.</p>\n<p>So now we might ask: do the same mechanisms suggest that technological progress will be good <em>overall</em>, on aggregate utilitarian grounds?</p>\n<p>The answer appears to me to be <em>no</em>.</p>\n<p>It seems clear that economic, technological, and social progress are limited, and that material progress on these dimensions must stop long before human society has run its course. That is, the relationship between progress at time T and progress at time T+1 will break down eventually. For example, if exponential growth continued at 1% of its current rate for 1% of the remaining lifetime of our sun, Robin Hanson points out each atom in our galaxy would need to be about 10<sup>140</sup>\u00a0times as valuable as modern society. Indeed, unless our current understanding of the laws of physics, progress will eventually necessarily slow to an extremely modest rate by any meaningful measure.</p>\n<p>So while further progress today increases our current quality of life, it will not increase the quality of life of our distant descendants--they will live in a world that is \"saturated,\" where progress has run its course and has only very modest further effects.</p>\n<p>I think this is sufficient to respond to the original argument: we have seen progress associated with good outcomes, and we have a relatively clear understanding of the mechanism by which that has occurred. We can see pretty clearly that this particular mechanism doesn't have much effect on very long-term outcomes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"_Some_responses_\">[Some responses]</h3>\n<p><strong>1.\u00a0</strong>Maybe society will encounter problems in the future which will have an effect on the long-term conditions of human society, and their ability to solve those problems will depend on levels of development when they are encountered?\u00a0</p>\n<p>[My first response to all of these considerations is really \"Maybe, but you're no longer in the regime of extrapolating from past progress. I don't think that this is suggested by the fact that science has made our lives so much better and cured disease.\" But to be a good sport I'll answer them here anyway.]</p>\n<p>For better or worse, almost all problems with the potential to permanently change human affairs are <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/01/06/how-useful-is-progress/\">of our own making</a>. There are natural disasters, periodic asteroid impacts, diseases and great die-offs; there is aging and natural climate change and the gradual burning out of the stars. But compared to human activity all of those events are <em>slow</em>. The risk of extinction from asteroids each year is very small, fast climate change is driven primarily by human activity, and the stars burn down at a glacial pace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The ability to permanently alter the future is almost entirely driven by technological progress and the use of existing technologies. With the possible exceptions of anthropogenic climate change and a particularly bad nuclear war, we barely even have the ability to really mess things up today: it appears that almost all of the risk of things going terribly and irrevocably awry lies in our future. Hastening technological progress improves our ability to cope with problems, but it also hastens the arrival of the problems at almost the same rate.</p>\n<p><strong>2. </strong>\u00a0Why should progress continue indefinitely? Maybe there will be progress until 2100, and the level of sophistication in that year will determine the entire future?</p>\n<p>This scenario just seems to strain plausibility. Again, almost all ways that progress could plausibly stop don't depend on the calendar year, but are driven by human activities (and presumably some intermediating technological progress).</p>\n<p><strong>3. </strong>Might\u00a0faster progress beget more progress and a more functional society, which will be better able to deal with the problems that arise at each fixed level of development?</p>\n<p>I think this is an interesting discussion but I don't think it has any plausible claim to a \"robust\" or \"non-speculative\" argument, or to be a primary consideration in what outcomes are desirable. In particular, you can't justify this kind of thing with \"Progress seems to have been good so far,\" you need to run a much more sophisticated historical counterfactual, and probably you need to start getting into speculating about causal mechanisms if you actually want the story to be convincing. Note that you need to distinguish wealth-related effects (which don't depend on how fast wealth is accumulated, and consequently don't affect our ability to address problems at each fixed level of development) from rate-of-progress related effects, which seems empirically treacherous (not to mention the greater superficial plausibility of wealth effects).</p>\n<p>In particular I might note that technological progress seems to have proceded essentially continuously for the last 1000 or so years, with periodic setbacks but no apparent risk of stalling or backpedaling (outside of small isolated populations). Without the risk of an indefinite stagnation leading to eventual extinction, it's not really clear why momentum effects would have a positive long-term impact (this seems to be begging the question). It is more clear how people being nicer could help, and I grant that there is some evidence for faster progress leading to niceness, but I think this is definitely in the relatively speculative regime.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"_An_alternative_story_\">[An alternative story]</h2>\n<p>An alternative story is that while progress has a modest positive effect on long-term welfare, this effect is radically smaller than the observed medium-term effects, and in particular much smaller than differential progress. Magically replacing the world of 1800 with the world of 1900 would make the calendar years 1800-1900 a lot more fun, but in the long run all of the same things happen (just 100 years sooner).</p>\n<p>That is, if most problems that people will face are of their own creation, we might be more interested in the relative rate at which people create problems (or acquire the ability to create them) vs. resolve problems (or acquire the ability to resolve them). Such relative rates in progress would be much more important than an overall speedup in technological, economic, and social progress. And moreover, we can't use the fact that X has been good for quality of life historically in order to say anything about which side of the ledger it comes down on.</p>\n<p>I'd like to note that this is not an argument about AI or about any particular future scenario. It's an argument that I could have made just as well in 1500 (except insofar as natural phenomena have become even less concerning now than they were in 1500). And the observations since 1500 don't seem to discredit this model at all. Predictions only diverge regarding what happens <em>after</em>\u00a0quality of life stops increasing from technological progress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This might operate at the level of e.g. differential technological development, so that some kinds of technological progress create value while others destroy it; or it might operate at a higher level, so that e.g. the accumulation of wealth destroys value while technological progress creates it (if we thought it was better to be as poor as possible given our level of technological sophistication). Or we might think that population growth is bad while everything else is good, or whatever.</p>\n<p><strong>The key message</strong>\u00a0is that when we compare our situation to the situation of last century, we mostly observe the overall benefits of progress, but that on a long-run perspective these overall benefits are likely to be much smaller than the difference between \"good stuff\" and \"bad stuff.\"</p>\n<p>(For a more fleshed out version of this story, see again Nick Beckstead's\u00a0<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/nbeckstead/research\">thesis</a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.gooddoneright.com/#!nick-beckstead/cxpp\">this presentation</a>.)</p>\n<h1 id=\"Implications\">Implications</h1>\n<p>Why does any of this matter? A few random implications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I suspect that addressing poverty is good for the overall pace of progress, and for the welfare of people over the next 200 years. But I don't see much reason to think that it will make our society better in the very long-run, and I think that the arguments to this effect are quite speculative. For example, I think they are much more speculative than arguments offered for more explicitly future-shaping interventions. The same can be said for many other common-sense interventions.</li>\n<li>I think that faster AI progress is a huge boon for this generation's welfare. But I think that improving our understanding of where AI is going and how it will develop is probably more important, because that reduces the probability that the development of AI unfolds in an unfavorable way rather than merely accelerating its arrival.</li>\n<li>I think that improvements in decision-making capabilities or (probably) intelligence are more important than other productivity benefits, e.g. the benefits of automation, and so tend to focus on cognitive enhancement or improvements collective decision-making rather than the more conventional menu of entrepreneurial projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>I don't think that any of these are particularly speculative or wild propositions, but often people arguing against investment in differential progress seem to have unreasonably high expectations. For example, I expect understanding-where-AI-is-going to have a much smaller effect on the world than helping-AI-get-there, but don't think that is a sufficient argument against it.</div></div></div>"},

However, frequently <strong>doing something </strong>and <strong>starting somewhere </strong>is a lot better than just thinking and ending up <em>not doing anything</em>. So here's a quick list of things that EAs can do.</p>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2 id=\"Donate_Smarter\">Donate Smarter</h2>\n<p>This is perhaps the most <em>classic </em>option for an effective altruist. Money can go a long way when donated to a top charity -- and GiveWell has spent tens of thousands of hours to find <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">some outstanding charities that are thoroughly vetted and in need of funding</a> in order to make the world a better place!</p>\n<p>If you're already donating money to a <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell top charity</a>, then great! But, if you're not, then<strong> consider whether your existing donations might go further</strong> when guided by the highest quality research on how to get the biggest bang for your buck in the charity sector. There are certainly good reasons -- both personal and altruistic -- to not donate to a GiveWell-picked org, but a great way to make the world a better place is to donate some of your money there!</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Resources\">Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com/\">The Life You Can Save</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2 id=\"Small_Life_Boosts\">Small Life Boosts</h2>\n<p>However, you don't just have to donate money. There are other small boosts you can make to increase your charitable contributions at no cost to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Join Amazon Smile. </strong>Sign up at <a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com\">smile.amazon.com</a> and choose a charity of your choice, and they'll get <strong>0.5%</strong> of all future Amazon purchase amounts, <em>as long as you remember to go to smile.amazon.com when you shop</em>. You can type in the charity into the box. Both \"GiveWell\" (under their non-profit name \"Clear Fund\") and \"GiveDirectly\" are available.</p>\n<p><strong>Join some mailing lists. </strong>Stay informed about what organizations are up to by following <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/getinvolved/newsletter.aspx\">The Life You Can Save mailing list</a>, <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/about/stay-updated\">GiveWell mailing list</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/about/media/newsletter/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a> mailing list.</p>\n<p><strong>Set up an altruistic tip jar. </strong>If you're feeling weighed down by rejecting nice causes that happen to not be <em>the single best cause in the whole world </em>and/or you feel the urge to donate now but think it more prudent to make one donation at the end of the year, you could make an altruistic tip jar -- throw in a poker chip every time you feel moved to donate, and then count the results at the end of the year when you want to turn that donation into cash. The system also feels more tangible and exciting than donating online. <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/3kl/optimizing_fuzzies_and_utilons_the_altruism_chip/\">...Here's more on this idea.</a></p>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2 id=\"Try_Out_Advocacy\">Try Out Advocacy</h2>\n<p>Also, you don't have to donate <em>your own </em>money -- you could <strong>encourage other people to donate</strong>, which not only raises money, but spreads the word!</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Talk_to_friends\">Talk to friends</strong></p>\n<p>The easiest way to advocate for top charities is to simply talk to people. When effective altruism comes up in conversation, don't be afraid to talk about it. (Though no need to go out of your way to talk to people about it if you feel shy.) And sometimes it comes up in unexpected ways. For example, if someone mentions that they don't know what they want to do after college, you could suggest they look into <a href=\"http://www.80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a>.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Run_a_Giving_Game\">Run a Giving Game</strong></p>\n<p>Another way to engage people with the idea of weighing charities is to run a Giving Game. Giving Games are when players are introduced to a few pre-selected charities and are given an opportunity to dialogue about them and ultimately decide which of the charities to make a donation to, with the donation usually being supplied by the person running the Giving Game. Many Giving Games involve a moderated discussion, but other structures could be used. Giving Games could be online, over casual conversation, at a university, or placed on a street corner.</p>\n<p>Ben Kuhn and Harvard Effective Altruism found that Giving Games are <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/outreach\">one of the best ways to engage people with effective altruism</a>. <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\">The Life You Can Save</a> runs many Giving Games and has compiled <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/givinggames.aspx\">a lot of resources on them</a>.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Resources1\">Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/givinggames/resources.aspx\">Resources on Charities for Giving Games</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/givinggames/faq.aspx\">Frequently Asked Questions about Giving Games</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/givinggames/tips.aspx\">Tips for Running a Giving Game</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2 id=\"Run_a_Fundraiser\">Run a Fundraiser</h2>\n<p>A specific way to advocate for top charities is to run a fundraiser. One idea is to run a fundraiser for your birthday -- people tend to be very receptive to this, and <a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/birthday-fundraisers.html\">it's really easy to do</a>.</p>\n<p>You also could run other fundraisers, for <a href=\"https://community.givingtuesday.org/page/faq\">Giving Tuesday</a>, or for Christmas. If you make the fundraiser look compelling and promote it heavily -- and don't run too many fundraisers in any given year -- you should come out with a good amount of money moved to good charities and awareness to boot!</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Resources2\">Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/birthday-fundraisers.html\">How to run an EA fundraiser for your birthday</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2 id=\"Join_or_Start_a_Local_Meetup_Group\">Join or Start a Local Meetup Group</h2>\n<p>Another way to engage people is to join or create a local meetup group. The meetup group could be about effective altruism, but it also could be about something related, like skepticism. You probably could even find traction in vegetarian groups or humanist groups or religious groups. Just try it out! Joining a pre-existing meetup is lower cost and gives you the benefit of connecting with an already existing group, but don't be dissuaded from starting your own -- <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/43s/starting_a_lw_meetup_is_easy/\">starting a LessWrong (or any other kind of) meetup is easy</a>!</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Resources_for_Joining_a_Pre_existing_Meetup\">Resources for Joining a Pre-existing Meetup</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups\">List of LessWrong Meetups</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/\">Meetup.com</a> is a great way to find meetups -- for example, search for \"skeptic\" or \"vegetarian\".

{"date": "10th Sep 2014", "title": "Cosmopolitanism", "author": "TopherHallquist", "num_comments": "42 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>It\u2019s a label I believe effective altruists should adopt to better explain a core part of what effective altruism is. Historically, it comes from Greek roots meaning \u201cworld\u201d and \u201ccity,\u201d and is associated with Diogenes of Sinope\u2019s (c. 404-323 BC) declaration that he was a \u201ccitizen of the world.\u201d Without the metaphors of world-cities or citizenship, I mean by \u201ccosmopolitanism\u201d a moral and political stance that gives the interests of people of other nationalities a weight equal (or at least nearly equal) to those of one\u2019s compatriots.</p>\n<p>Support for cosmopolitanism among effective altruists is, as far as I can tell, unanimous. There is no wing of the effective altruist movement exclusively focused on fighting poverty in the US, for example. But effective altruists don\u2019t talk about cosmopolitanism much. When they do, they call it\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#Impartiality\">\u201cimpartiality,\u201d</a> which is too vague. Judges, juries, journalists, and so on (to limit myself to the \u201cj\u201ds) are expected to be impartial in a sense, but only in specific domains. Cosmopolitanism\u2019s demands are much broader.</p>\n<p>I think effective altruists don\u2019t talk about cosmopolitanism more because they take it for granted. Peter Singer, in his influential and now more than forty year old article <a href=\"http://www.utilitarianism.net/singer/by/1972----.htm\">\u201cFamine, Affluence, and Morality,\u201d</a> devoted only a paragraph to the subject, saying \u201cI do not think I need to say much in defense of the refusal to take proximity and distance into account.\u201d But there are good reasons to doubt most people are fully on board with cosmopolitanism.</p>\n<p>This is most obvious in politics. Can you imagine a politician advocating free trade on the grounds that, while it might hurt the politician\u2019s own country a little, it would have enormous benefits for people living in other countries? Or making the same argument for immigration? In the United States, critics of military intervention tend to focus on the costs in terms of American lives and dollars, and the \u201clack of a compelling national interest.\u201d The fact that these interventions often wreak enormous havoc on the countries we bomb and invade can seem to come in as a distant fourth in anti-war rhetoric.</p>\n<p>I suspect this also explains much of why most people aren\u2019t more committed to fighting global poverty. People may <em>claim</em><span> to believe, for example, that their donations will just get stolen by corrupt governments, but often this sounds like an excuse. And imagine what would happen if you went beyond praising the cost-effectiveness of anti-malarial bed nets, and told them to direct efforts </span><em>away</em><span> from specific local causes they support. In response, they probably wouldn\u2019t </span><em>quite</em><span> tell you they care about geographic neighbors more than foreigners, but you might hear a little speech about the importance of responsibility towards your own community.</span></p>\n<p>There\u2019s a paradox here. The label \u201canti-foreign\u201d has <em>some</em> negative connotations, but it\u2019s not really taboo in the way racism is. This is in spite of favoritism based on place of birth being no less arbitrary than favoritism based on skin color. In America, there\u2019s a notorious anti-immigration blogger named Steve Sailer who\u2019s often accused of racism. I\u2019ve looked at Sailer\u2019s writings, and concluded that if he\u2019s racist, he\u2019s much less driven by racism than nativism. Sailer prefers to call it \u201ccitizenism\u201d; Wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Sailer#Views_and_criticism\">quotes him</a> as saying, \u201cI believe Americans should be biased in favor of the welfare of our current fellow citizens over that of the six billion foreigners.\u201d That may <em>sound</em> racist to many people, but it\u2019s hard to explain America\u2019s current immigration policies without assuming a lot of quiet support for Sailer\u2019s views.</p>\n<p>In America, the relative taboo-ness of racism and nativism may be influenced by America\u2019s history regarding race. Still, critics of anti-immigrant parties in Europe often seem to go out of their way to criticize those parties as racist, as if it weren\u2019t enough to criticize them for being anti-immigrant. It would be nice if people would treat nativism as bad enough in itself, whether or not it\u2019s paired with racism.</p>\n<p>So far, I\u2019ve just been trying to argue that effective altruists take cosmopolitanism too much for granted, and should more see cosmopolitanism as something distinctive about themselves. I haven\u2019t been trying to argue that effective altruists should be actively supporting immigration reform or other cosmopolitan political causes. I don\u2019t actually know if it would be worth the effort. I think it would be hugely beneficial if major governments became more cosmopolitan, but making that happen may be a cause that\u2019s too crowded and too intractable.</p>\n<p>That said, I\u2019m enthusiastic about the <a href=\"http://www.openphilanthropy.org/\">Open Philanthropy Project</a>\u2019s research on policy advocacy, because it may lead to finding cost-effective ways to influence government policy in a more cosmopolitan direction. Even if there is not much we can do now directly, explicitly advocating for cosmopolitan ideals may have important long-run benefits. Finally, it can be enlightening to analyze politics through a cosmopolitan lens. It can be depressing, because government policy is so often un-cosmopolitan, but it can also be a source of common ground between superficially different political camps.</p>\n<p>Many criticisms of the standard left-right political axis are well-known. Libertarians like to describe themselves as socially liberal and economically conservative (strangely, few people do the opposite). <a href=\"http://theamericanscene.com/2010/04/26/notes-toward-a-new-political-taxonomy\">Another proposed taxonomy</a> uses three axes: individualist vs. authoritarian, winners vs. losers, and progress vs. decay. But I think cosmopolitanism vs. nationalistic, nativistic, and parochial outlooks is often more a more important axis.</p>\n<p>For instance, I find an enormous amount to like in libertarian writer <a href=\"http://www.bcaplan.com/\">Bryan Caplan</a>. Our disagreements on taxes or consequentialism vs. deontology feel like minor issues compared to his excellent writings on <a href=\"http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/pdfs/whyimmigration.pdf\">immigration</a> and <a href=\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/04/the_common-sens.html\">war</a>. That\u2019s because we\u2019re both cosmopolitans. On the other hand, there are parochial libertarians who are much more focused on opposing federal regulations and taxes but don\u2019t much mind if the local police bully perceived \u201coutsiders.\u201d I don\u2019t find much common ground with them. But nor do I find much in common with parochial liberals focused on things like the welfare of local middle-class union members.</p>\n<p>I want to say something about religious conservatives here, since they are such an important force in the US (though I know this is not true in all countries). Religion often seems to end up aligned with nationalism, perhaps because religious and national boundaries often coincide. But there\u2019s no reason this <em>must</em> be so. Modern religions aspire to cross national boundaries. Many Christian thinkers play up Christianity\u2019s cosmopolitan streak\u2014to hear them tell it, Christianity invented cosmopolitanism. This isn\u2019t true; as already noted cosmopolitanism can be traced back to ancient Greece. By the time Christianity came on the scene, cosmopolitanism had gone mainstream in the Roman world via Stoicism. Nevertheless, Christianity\u2019s cosmopolitanism is real: think of the parable of the good Samaritan, or Paul\u2019s \u201cneither Jew nor Gentile\u201d line in Galatians.</p>\n<p>There are a handful of policy issues where the implications of cosmopolitanism seem relatively clear: governments should give the interests of foreigners more weight in decisions that affect them, including immigration, trade, foreign aid, and global environmental issues (including global warming). But rather than say much about those issues, I want to finish this post by talking about a slightly more complicated issue, foreign military intervention.</p>\n<p>The US has been justifying military actions in altruistic terms since at least the Spanish-American War, which was sold partly as defending Cubans from their Spanish oppressor. Other countries have engaged in similar rhetoric. What are we to make of it? Should it be dismissed as obvious propaganda? Or proponents of altruistic intervention deserve to be taken seriously for having the right ideals?</p>\n<p>Philosopher Richard Chappell proposes a useful test here, which he calls <a href=\"http://www.philosophyetc.net/2014/08/the-cosmopolitan-civilian-test-for.html\">the cosmopolitan civilian test for proportionality in war.</a> It asks, \u201cWould these civilian casualties be considered \u2018proportionate\u2019 if the civilians in question were of a different nationality?\u201d Framed in those terms, I think it is obvious that the answer is all too often \u201cno.\u201d As Caplan puts it, \u201cIf a policeman fought crime the way that \u2018civilized\u2019 armies wage war, we'd put him in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p>But there may be exceptions, so I think it is important to emphasize the standard, rather than specific applications. Presumably proponents of altruistic intervention would claim the actions they advocate pass the cosmopolitan civilian test. After all, it\u2019s not as if interventionists are going to say they place great value on foreigners\u2019 liberty, but not so much on their lives. Asking proponents of particular interventions to explain how an intervention passes the cosmopolitan civilian test may be a good way to distinguish genuine (if misguided) altruists from people whose real motives are less noble.</p>\n<p>Again, none of this is to say that trying to enact a cosmopolitan policy agenda should necessarily be a top priority for effective altruists. But I think the effective altruist movement would benefit from being more self-conscious about its cosmopolitanism.</p></div></div>"},

It\u2019s embarrassing to think of myself as being inconsistent, so perhaps I decide that running isn't actually good for my health after all. In short, I come up with new beliefs to suit the action I was already planning to take.</span><br><br><span>It's obviously silly to come up with new \"facts\" for the sake of convenience.

People love to catch vegetarians eating things they\u2019re \u201cnot supposed to,\u201d while catching an omnivore eating a turkey sandwich gives no such pleasure. People love to criticize Peter Singer because he wrote an <a href=\"http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Singeressayspring1972.pdf\">essay</a></span><span>\u00a0saying we should give money to poor people rather than buying new clothes and cars for ourselves, and yet he personally doesn\u2019t wear rags or live in a hovel.

Give yourself permission to go partway. I\u2019ve often heard people say, \u201cI couldn\u2019t be vegetarian because I\u2019d miss [particular food] too much.\u201d I felt that way about ice cream. So I spent a summer eating vegan - except for ice cream. It was morally inconsistent, and it felt much less morally pure to say, \"I'm eating vegan\u00a0</span><span>...um,\u00a0except for ice cream</span><span>,\" but it resulted in me eating far fewer animal products than I usually did.</span><br><br><span>And maybe if I'm honest about what I believe is right, someone else with more willpower or different life circumstances will be persuaded and go farther than I will. Certainly Peter Singer has persuaded many people that giving money is a good thing to do, even if he hasn't given away every last penny of his own.</span><br><br><span>In the end, it\u2019s about what your goals are.

It is <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/on-caring/\">crossposted</a> from <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/\">my blog</a>, and many people here will be familiar with the ideas. However, I hope it will be useful for newcomers and others who are curious about what it means to be an EA, or who aren't sure whether they have what it takes.</em></p>\n<h1 id=\"1\">1</h1>\n<p>I'm not very good at <em>feeling</em> the size of large numbers. Once you start tossing around numbers larger than 1000 (or maybe even 100), the numbers just seem \"big\".</p>\n<p>Consider Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. If you told me that Sirius is as big as a million earths, I would feel like that's a lot of Earths. If, instead, you told me that you could fit a <em>billion</em> Earths inside Sirius\u2026 I would still just feel like that's a lot of Earths.</p>\n<p>The feelings are almost identical. <em>In context</em>, my brain grudgingly admits that a billion is a lot larger than a million, and puts forth a token effort to feel like a billion-Earth-sized star is bigger than a million-Earth-sized star. But out of context \u2014 if I wasn't anchored at \"a million\" when I heard \"a billion\" \u2014 both these numbers just feel vaguely large.</p>\n<p>I feel a <em>little</em> respect for the bigness of numbers, if you pick really really large numbers. If you say \"one followed by a hundred zeroes\", then this feels <em>a lot</em> bigger than a billion. But it certainly doesn't feel (in my gut) like it's 10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 times bigger than a billion. Not in the way that four apples <em>intenally feels</em> like twice as many as two apples. My brain can't even begin to wrap itself around this sort of magnitude differential.</p>\n<p>This phenomena is related to <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hw/scope_insensitivity/\">scope insensitivity</a>, and it's important to me because I live in a world where sometimes the things I care about are really really numerous.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"http://www.globalissues.org/article/26/poverty-facts-and-stats\">billions of people live in squalor</a>, with hundreds of millions of them deprived of basic needs and/or dying from disease. And though most of them are out of my sight, I still care about them.</p>\n<p>The loss of a human life with all is joys and all its sorrows is tragic no matter what the cause, and the tragedy is not reduced simply because I was far away, or because I did not know of it, or because I did not know how to help, or because I was not personally responsible.</p>\n<p>Knowing this, I care about every single individual on this planet. The problem is, my brain is <em>simply incapable</em> of taking the amount of caring I feel for a single person and scaling it up by a billion times. I lack the internal capacity to feel that much. My care-o-meter simply doesn't go up that far.</p>\n<p>And this is a problem.</p>\n<p><a></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"2\">2</h1>\n<p>It's a common trope that courage isn't about being fearless, it's about being afraid but <em>doing the right thing anyway</em>. In the same sense, caring about the world isn't about having a gut feeling that corresponds to the amount of suffering in the world, it's about <em>doing the right thing anyway</em>. Even without the feeling.</p>\n<p>My internal care-o-meter was calibrated to deal with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number\">about a hundred and fifty people</a>, and it <em>simply can't express</em> the amount of caring that I have for billions of sufferers. The internal care-o-meter just doesn't go up that high.</p>\n<p>Humanity is playing for unimaginably high stakes. At the very least, there are billions of people suffering today. At the worst, there are quadrillions (or more) potential humans, transhumans, or posthumans whose existence depends upon what we do here and now. All the intricate civilizations that the future could hold, the experience and art and beauty that is possible in the future, depends upon the present.</p>\n<p>When you're faced with stakes like these, your internal caring heuristics \u2014 calibrated on numbers like \"ten\" or \"twenty\", and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number\">maxing out around one hundred and fifty</a> \u2014 completely fail to grasp the gravity of the situation.</p>\n<p>Saving a person's life feels <em>great</em>, and <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hx/one_life_against_the_world/\">it would probably feel just about as good to save one life as it would feel to save the world</a>. It surely wouldn't be <em>many billion times</em> more of a high to save the world, because your hardware can't express a feeling a billion times bigger than the feeling of saving a person's life. But even though the altruistic high from saving someone's life would be shockingly similar to the altruistic high from saving the world, always remember that <em>behind</em> those similar feelings there is a whole world of difference.</p>\n<p>Our internal care-feelings are woefully inadequate for deciding how to act in a world with big problems.</p>\n<h1 id=\"3\">3</h1>\n<p>There's a mental shift that happened to me when I first started internalizing scope insensitivity. It is a little difficult to articulate, so I'm going to start with a few stories.</p>\n<p>Consider Alice, a software engineer at Amazon in Seattle. Once a month or so, those college students with show up on street corners with clipboards, looking ever more disillusioned as they struggle to convince people to donate to <a href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/\">Doctors Without Borders</a>. Usually, Alice avoids eye contact and goes about her day, but this month they finally manage to corner her. They explain Doctors Without Borders, and she actually has to admit that it sounds like a pretty good cause. She ends up handing them $20 through a combination of guilt, social pressure, and altruism, and then rushes back to work. (Next month, when they show up again, she avoids eye contact.)</p>\n<p>Now consider Bob, who has been given the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Bucket_Challenge\">Ice Bucket Challenge</a> by a friend on facebook. He feels too busy to do the ice bucket challenge, and instead just donates $100 to <a href=\"http://www.alsa.org/\">ALSA</a>.</p>\n<p>Now consider Christine, who is in the college sorority \u0391\u0394\u03a0. \u0391\u0394\u03a0 is engaged in a competition with \u03a0\u0392\u03a6 (another sorority) to see who can raise the most money for the National Breast Cancer Foundation in a week. Christine has a competitive spirit and gets engaged in fund-raising, and gives a few hundred dollars herself over the course of the week (especially at times when \u0391\u0394\u03a0 is especially behind).</p>\n<p>All three of these people are donating money to charitable organizations\u2026 and that's great. But notice that there's something similar in these three stories: these donations are largely motivated by a <em>social context</em>. Alice feels obligation and social pressure. Bob feels social pressure and maybe a bit of camaraderie. Christine feels camaraderie and competitiveness. These are all fine motivations, but notice that these motivations are related to the <em>social setting</em>, and only tangentially to the <em>content</em> of the charitable donation.</p>\n<p>If you took any of Alice or Bob or Christine and asked them why they aren't donating <em>all</em> of their time and money to these causes that they apparently believe are worthwhile, they'd look at you funny and they'd probably think you were being rude (with good reason!). If you pressed, they might tell you that money is a little tight right now, or that they would donate more if they were a better person.</p>\n<p>But the question would still feel kind of <em>wrong</em>. Giving all your money away is just not what you do with money. We can all <em>say out loud</em> that people who give all their possessions away are really great, but behind closed doors we all know that people are crazy. (Good crazy, perhaps, but crazy all the same.)</p>\n<p>This is a mindset that I inhabited for a while. There's an alternative mindset that can hit you like a freight train when you start internalizing scope insensitivity.</p>\n<h1 id=\"4\">4</h1>\n<p>Consider Daniel, a college student shortly after the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill\">Deepwater Horizon</a> BP oil spill. He encounters one of those college students with the clipboards on the street corners, soliciting donations to the <a href=\"http://www.worldwildlife.org/\">World Wildlife Foundation</a>. They're trying to save as many oiled birds as possible. Normally, Daniel would simply dismiss the charity as Not The Most Important Thing, or Not Worth His Time Right Now, or Somebody Else's Problem, but this time Daniel has been thinking about how his brain is bad at numbers and decides to do a quick sanity check.</p>\n<p>He pictures himself walking along the beach after the oil spill, and encountering a group of people cleaning birds as fast as they can. They simply don't have the resources to clean all the available birds. A pathetic young bird flops towards his feet, slick with oil, eyes barely able to open. He kneels down to pick it up and help it onto the table. One of the bird-cleaners informs him that they won't have time to get to that bird themselves, but he could pull on some gloves and could probably save the bird with three minutes of washing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Bv2wRceCYKA/S-whZ1sSJ3I/AAAAAAAABjo/cgXz7Npz_W0/s320/Dawn_IBRRC_2010.05.07_MG_7082_240.jpg\" alt=\"blog.bird-rescue.org\"></p>\n<p>Daniel decides that he <em>would</em> spend three minutes of his time to save the bird, and that he would <em>also</em> be happy to pay at least $3 to have someone else spend a few minutes cleaning the bird. He introspects and finds that this is not just because he imagined a bird right in front of him: he feels that it is <em>worth</em> at least three minutes of his time (or $3) to save an oiled bird in some vague platonic sense.</p>\n<p>And, because he's been thinking about scope insensitivity, he <em>expects</em> his brain to misreport how much he actually cares about large numbers of birds: the internal feeling of caring can't be expected to line up with the actual importance of the situation. So instead of just <em>asking his gut</em> how much he cares about de-oiling lots of birds, he shuts up and multiplies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailydeadbirds.com/\">Thousands and thousands</a> of birds were oiled by the BP spill alone. After shutting up and multiplying, Daniel realizes (with growing horror) that the amount he <em>acutally</em> cares about oiled birds is lower bounded by two months of hard work and/or fifty thousand dollars. And that's not even counting wildlife threatened by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oil_spills\">other oil spills</a>.</p>\n<p>And if he cares that much about <em>de-oiling birds</em>, then how much does he actually care about factory farming, nevermind hunger, or poverty, or sickness? How much does he actually care about wars that ravage nations? About neglected, deprived children? About the future of humanity? He <em>actually</em> cares about these things to the tune of much more money than he has, and much more time than he has.</p>\n<p>For the first time, Daniel sees a glimpse of of how much he actually cares, and how poor a state the world is in.</p>\n<p>This has the strange effect that Daniel's reasoning goes full-circle, and he realizes that he actually <em>can't</em> care about oiled birds to the tune of 3 minutes or $3: not because the birds aren't <em>worth</em> the time and money (and, in fact, he thinks that the economy produces things priced at $3 which are worth less than the bird's survival), but because he can't spend <em>his</em> time or money on saving the birds. The opportunity cost suddenly seems far too high: there is <em>too much else to do!</em> People are sick and starving and dying! The very future of our civilization is at stake!</p>\n<p>Daniel doesn't wind up giving $50k to the WWF, and he also doesn't donate to ALSA or NBCF. But if you ask <em>Daniel</em> why he's not donating all his money, he won't look at you funny or think you're rude. He's left the place where you don't care far behind, and has realized that <em>his mind was lying to him the whole time</em> about the gravity of the real problems.</p>\n<p>Now he realizes that he <em>can't possibly do enough</em>. After adjusting for his scope insensitivity (and the fact that his brain lies about the size of large numbers), even the \"less important\" causes like the WWF suddenly seem worthy of dedicating a life to. Wildlife destruction and ALS and breast cancer are suddenly all problems that he would <em>move mountains</em> to solve \u2014 except he's finally understood that there are just too many mountains, and ALS isn't the bottleneck, and AHHH HOW DID ALL THESE MOUNTAINS GET HERE?</p>\n<p>In the original mindstate, the reason he didn't drop everything to work on ALS was because it just didn't seem\u2026 pressing enough. Or tractable enough. Or important enough. Kind of. These are sort of the reason, but the real reason is more that the concept of \"dropping everything to address ALS\" never even <em>crossed his mind</em> as a real possibility. The idea was too much of a break from the standard narrative. It wasn't his problem.</p>\n<p>In the new mindstate, <em>everything</em> is his problem. The only reason he's not dropping everything to work on ALS is because there are far too many things to do first.</p>\n<p>Alice and Bob and Christine usually aren't spending time solving all the world's problems because they forget to see them. If you remind them \u2014 put them in a social context where they remember how much they care (hopefully without guilt or pressure) \u2014 then they'll likely donate a little money.</p>\n<p>By contrast, Daniel and others who have undergone the mental shift aren't spending time solving all the world's problems because there are <em>just too many problems</em>. (Daniel hopefully goes on to discover movements like <a href=\"http://effectivealtruism.org/\">effective altruism</a> and starts contributing towards fixing the world's most pressing problems.)</p>\n<h1 id=\"5\">5</h1>\n<p>I'm not trying to preach here about how to be a good person. You don't need to share my viewpoint to be a good person (obviously).</p>\n<p>Rather, I'm trying to point at a shift in perspective. Many of us go through life understanding that we <em>should</em> care about people suffering far away from us, but failing to. I think that this attitude is tied, at least in part, to the fact that most of us implicitly trust our internal care-o-meters.</p>\n<p>The \"care feeling\" isn't usually strong enough to compel us to frantically save everyone dying. So while we acknowledge that it would be <em>virtuous</em> to do more for the world, we think that we <em>can't</em>, because we weren't gifted with that virtuous extra-caring that prominent altruists must have.</p>\n<p>But this is an error \u2014 prominent altruists aren't the people who have a larger care-o-meter, they're the people who have <em>learned not to trust their care-o-meters</em>.</p>\n<p>Our care-o-meters are broken. They don't work on large numbers. Nobody has one capable of faithfully representing the scope of the world's problems. But the fact that you can't <em>feel</em> the caring doesn't mean that you can't <em>do</em> the caring.</p>\n<p>You don't get to feel the appropriate amount of \"care\", in your body. Sorry \u2014 the world's problems are just too large, and your body is not built to respond appropriately to problems of this magnitude. But if you choose to do so, you can still <em>act</em> like the world's problems are as big as they are. You can stop trusting the internal feelings to guide your actions and switch over to manual control.</p>\n<h1 id=\"6\">6</h1>\n<p>This, of course, leads us to the question of \"what the hell do you then?\"</p>\n<p>And I don't really know yet. (Though I'll plug the <a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org\">Giving What We Can pledge</a>, <a href=\"http://givewell.org\">GiveWell</a>, <a href=\"http://intelligence.org\">MIRI</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk\">The Future of Humanity Institute</a> as a good start).</p>\n<p>I think that at least part of it comes from a certain sort of desperate perspective. It's not enough to think you <em>should</em> change the world \u2014 you also need the sort of desperation that comes from realizing that you would dedicate your entire life to solving the world's 100th biggest problem if you could, but you can't, because there are 99 bigger problems you have to address first.</p>\n<p>I'm not trying to guilt you into giving more money away \u2014 becoming a philanthropist is <em>really really hard</em>. (If you're <em>already</em> a philanthropist, then you have my acclaim and my affection.) First it requires you to have money, which is uncommon, and then it requires you to <em>throw that money at distant invisible problems</em>, which is not an easy sell to a human brain. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia\">Akrasia</a> is a formidable enemy. And most importantly, guilt doesn't seem like a good long-term motivator: if you want to join the ranks of people saving the world, I would rather you join them proudly. There are many trials and tribulations ahead, and we'd do better to face them with our heads held high.</p>\n<h1 id=\"7\">7</h1>\n<p>Courage isn't about being fearless, it's about being able to do the right thing even if you're afraid.</p>\n<p>And similarly, addressing the major problems of our time isn't about feeling a strong compulsion to do so. It's about doing it anyway, even when internal compulsion utterly fails to capture the scope of the problems we face.</p>\n<p>It's easy to look at especially virtuous people \u2014 Gandhi, Mother Theresa, Nelson Mandela \u2014 and conclude that they must have cared more than we do. But I don't think that's the case.</p>\n<p>Nobody gets to comprehend the scope of these problems. The closest we can get is doing the multiplication: finding something we care about, putting a number on it, and multiplying. And then trusting the numbers more than we trust our feelings.</p>\n<p>Because our feelings lie to us.</p>\n<p>When you do the multiplication, you realize that addressing global poverty and building a brighter future deserve more resources than currently exist. There is not enough money, time, or effort in the world to do what we need to do.</p>\n<p>There is only you, and me, and everyone else who is trying anyway.</p>\n<h1 id=\"8\">8</h1>\n<p>You can't actually feel the weight of the world. The human mind is not capable of that feat.</p>\n<p>But sometimes, you can catch a glimpse.</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "11th Nov 2014", "title": "Certificates of impact", "author": "Paul_Christiano", "num_comments": "24 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><h1 id=\"0__Introduction\">0. Introduction</h1>\n<div>In this post I describe a simple institution for altruistic funding and decision-making, characterized by the creation and exchange of \"certificates of impact.\" I\u2019m interested in your thoughts and criticisms.\u00a0</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Typically an effectiveness-minded altruist would try to do as much good as possible. Instead, users of the certificates system try to collect certificates for as much good as possible.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Whenever anyone does anything, they can declare themselves to own an associated certificate of impact. Users of the system treat owning a certificate for X as equivalent to doing X themselves. In the case where certificates never change hands, this reduces precisely to the status quo.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>The primary difference is that certificates can also be bought, sold, or bartered; an altruist can acquire certificates through any combination of doing good themselves, and purchasing certificates from others.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>For example, a project to develop a malaria vaccine might be financed by investors. If the project succeeds the developers can declare themselves owners of an associated certificate, and distribute it to investors in the same way they might distribute profits. These investors could then resell this certificate to a philanthropist who is interested in funding malaria prevention and who honors certificates. The philanthropist would recognize the certificate as valuable to the extent that they believed that the original project was causally responsible for the development of the vaccine, and their willingness to pay would be the same as their willingness to develop the vaccine themselves (evaluated with the benefit of hindsight).</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Note that judging the value of a certificate is just as subjective as judging the value of the underlying activity, and is done separately by any philanthropist considering acquiring that certificate.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<h1 id=\"1__Some_existing_challenges\">1. Some existing challenges</h1>\n<div><ol>\n<li>Evaluating philanthropic opportunities is difficult, and most are not very good. Predictions are expensive and inaccurate, and often infeasible for small donors. The problem is worst when evaluating novel interventions. Prizes can address some of these difficulties, but have their own set of problems.</li>\n<li>One person might have the ability to do a project, another the desire to fund it, and a third the knowledge to evaluate it. Coordination is hard, and existing incentives misaligned, both for disseminating good information and executing good projects.</li>\n<li>Thinking about crowding out and causal responsibility is hard: if I don\u2019t do something, will someone else? Does it matter which of Oxfam\u2019s activities I fund? How is causal responsibility divided between donors and employees? Between the philanthropist who buys malaria nets and the government which distributes them?</li>\n<li>Prices are an elegant and flexible system for communication and coordination, which are often unavailable for altruists.</li>\n<li>Reasoning about leverage, and interacting with funders with different priorities, is tough. It\u2019s easy to end up neglecting a large possible upside or engaged in zero-sum conflict.</li>\n</ol></div>\n<h1 id=\"2__Certificates_of_impact\">2. Certificates of impact</h1>\n<div>Whenever anyone does something good in the world, they can \u201cmint\u201d an associated certificate of impact and declare themselves to be the owners. This can be as simple as making a public statement, analogous to acknowledging a funder. At the bottom of this post I could write \u201cThis post backs certificate [RationalAltruist-22], which is now owned by Paul Christiano;\u201d I could do the same in a press release describing a medical intervention, an academic paper reporting the results of an experiment, or a piece of open source software. Independently, I might post an offer to sell these certificates, or a philanthropist might contact me and express interest in purchasing them.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>By deciding which certificates they are willing to pay for, altruists using the system define the rules of the game. The protocol suggests considering a certificate valuable only if</div>\n<div><ol>\n<li><span> </span>It was issued by the group or individual that performed the associated activity.</li>\n<li><span> </span>It is the unique certificate associated with that activity.</li>\n</ol></div>\n<div>Users should be willing to pay the same amount for a valid certificate of X that they would be willing to pay to cause X to happen (and to keep the resulting certificate). That is, I should be indifferent between spending $100 to do a good deed and paying someone else $100 to do it, provided that in either case I get the entire certificate for that good deed.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Naturally this willingness to pay is subjective, depending on both values and views\u2014just like conventional grantmaking. Users maximize the total value of all of the certificates they hold, using whatever combination they prefer of doing good deeds themselves or acquiring others\u2019 certificates.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Certificates can be transferred just like any other IOU or title, and have the same practical issues with bookkeeping and double-spending. We can resolve these however we like (word of mouth, a bulletin board, a trusted central party, the bitcoin blockchain\u2026). Establishing properties [1] and [2] probably involves trusting the issuer\u2014just like conventional grantmaking.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Certificates can be subdivided arbitrarily. When a group accomplishes a project together, they must decide how to divide the resulting certificates in the same way that a profitable enterprise would decide how to divide the profits.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Owning a certificate for X would probably not carry the same prestige as doing X yourself. Funders using the system purchase certificates as a way to do good, not necessarily as a way to earn credit (though helping them get credit may be useful for getting them on board).</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>For now, I'm most interested in the question: would philanthropic activity in an area be improved, if many funders used this system or a similar incentive scheme?</div>\n<h1 id=\"3__Commentary\">3. Commentary</h1>\n<h2 id=\"Some_simple_examples\">Some simple examples</h2>\n<div><strong>No transfers.</strong> In the simplest possible example, certificates never change hands. In this case, the protocol reduces to \u201cDo the activities that you think have the largest positive impact on the world,\u201d i.e. the status quo.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><strong>Grants.</strong> A grantmaker might pay a charitable organization to perform some charitable work, in return for the resulting certificates. This also reduces to the status quo, at least for the grantmaker. A grantmaker might also leave some of the certificates to the charities, in the same way that a startup retains equity as an incentive.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><strong>Prizes.</strong> An unfunded do-gooder might keep the resulting certificates to themselves. Later, a philanthropist who appreciates the value of their work could buy the certificate off of them. The end result is very similar to a prize or bounty. As with a prize or bounty, that philanthropist could state their intentions in advance, choosing their own balance between flexibility and predictability.</div>\n<h2 id=\"So_what_\">So what?</h2>\n<div>Reproducing the status quo isn\u2019t so exciting. Do certificates improve the situation, or even change it? I think so, in ways that should be interesting to particularly effectiveness-minded funders. For example:</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><ol>\n<li>Allocating certificates requires explicit and transparent allocation of causal responsibility, both within teams and between teams and donors. In addition to the obvious cultural effects (which I would welcome despite the costs), this aligns individual incentives with altruistic goals, reducing incentives to mislead donors, volunteers, and employees.</li>\n<li>Exchanging certificates for money leads to a more consistent conversion between good done and compensation, especially if funders use a mix of prizes and grants. It can prevent good deeds from falling through the cracks, ameliorate some winner-take-all PR dynamics, and eliminate some zero-sum conflict. It also makes it easier to move between different funding modes.</li>\n<li>Purchasing certificates helps funders with different values coordinate; if I see a good deal I have an incentive to take it, without worrying about whether it might be an even better deal for someone else.</li>\n<li>The ability to resell certificates makes a purchase less of a commitment of philanthropic capital, and less of a strategic decision; instead it represents a direct vote of confidence in the work being funded.</li>\n</ol>\n<div><br></div>\n</div>\n<div>There are also risks inherent in bringing altruistic incentives closer to profit incentives (substituting extrinsic for intrinsic motivations, introducing new scope for zero-sum conflict...). How you feel about the tradeoff depends on how you feel about the relative merits of the two approaches, and may vary across domains.</div>\n<h2 id=\"Some_more_examples\">Some more examples</h2>\n<div>In addition to these simple examples, certificates of impact can facilitate more exotic interactions.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><strong>Financing.</strong> If I\u2019m optimistic about your project I might give you a loan which I expect you to pay back by selling a certificate. Or I could buy the certificates off you, as if I were a grantmaker, with the intention of reselling them.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><strong>Research universities.</strong> A research group can employ researchers in exchange for ownership of some of the certificates of impact they produce. These certificates can then be sold to funding agencies or philanthropists. This shields those funders from having to make predictions about research output, which they are often not equipped to do, and provides good incentives to both researchers and research groups. (This is a special case of financing and causal attribution, but it\u2019s an application close to my heart.)</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><strong>Interpolating between prizes and grants. </strong>By implementing both prizes and grants as trades, it is easier to interpolate between the two, providing some funding to get a project going in exchange for part of its output (presumably at an expected discount) and then purchasing more of its output after the fact.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><strong>Moral trade.</strong> Many cases of <a href=\"http://www.gooddoneright.com/#!toby-ord/c1dae\">moral trade</a> can be implemented by turning good deeds into certificates and bartering or trading in a marketplace. For others, such as abstaining from eating meat, this would be problematic (though it\u2019s not clear that the use of certificates s to blame).</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><strong>Targeted donations.</strong> If I want to fund only part of an organization\u2019s activities, I can purchase only those certificates of impact which I find valuable.\u00a0</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><strong>Research on effectiveness.</strong> If I think a certificate is too cheap, I can do research to evaluate its effectiveness; depending on the result I can buy the certificate, publish my research, and resell the certificate.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><strong>Trades across time.</strong> If my discount rate is lower than interest rates, I can sell certificates of impact today, invest the proceeds, and purchase certificates next year. (The price of each fixed certificate should rise at roughly market rates; but in addition to that, a certificate for a life saved in year 1 may have a different value than a certificate for a life saved in year 2, reflecting the discount rates of philanthropists.)</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><strong>Speculation.</strong> If I think at a change will be considered good in retrospect, I can purchase appropriate certificates now and aim to resell them later at a profit.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><strong>Multiple bottom lines.</strong> If a project has several objectives, it can use certificates to monetize all of them and then make local profit-maximizing decisions. This may lead to more sane decision-making, and much more transparency, than the status quo.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>(I\u2019m sparing you a much longer list.)</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<h2 id=\"Some_theory\">Some theory</h2>\n<div>Suppose that everyone who valued X were using the certificate protocol. (For concreteness, suppose it\u2019s everyone interested in cosmology research.)</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Then at equilibrium, the price of certificates of impact on X is equal to the marginal cost of achieving an impact on X. Any deviation is an arbitrage opportunity: if you can do X more cheaply, then you can sell the resulting certificates for a profit; if you are doing X more expensively, then you could save money by buying certificates instead.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Moreover, the status quo corresponds to one way of producing certificates, with total value equal to the total good being done. The actual outcome should be a Pareto improvement, and in particular should increase the total value of available certificates. As a result, it also increases the total amount of good being done.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>I wouldn't lean on this argument alone. But I do think it suggests that things might tend to work themselves out, at least if the system were widely adopted. For me, considering concrete cases bolsters that intuition.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>The infra-marginal units of X, those that were cheaper to produce than the marginal unit, pose a theoretical problem. These units of X get produced and purchased (good news!), but the resulting certificates are most likely to be sold for the marginal price of X (bad news!). That means there is a transfer of wealth, from the people who care about X (and who use the certificates system) to those who have infra-marginal opportunities to do X.\u00a0</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>This problem is worst for the early adopters of the certificate system, which is particularly unfortunate. And it\u2019s even worse when the opportunities to do X are so cheap that they were going to get done anyway. For example, suppose some high energy physicists would have to go out of their way to <em>avoid</em> doing some cosmology. Under the certificates system they would get paid for this research by cosmology funders who purchase the resulting certificates. But the cosmology funders might not be so happy about this, since the counterfactual impact of this funding is zilch.\u00a0</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Whether this is a feature or bug depends on how many really cheap opportunities to do X were failing to get done. Maybe the high energy physicists wouldn\u2019t even bother publishing their cosmology in a format that cosmologists would understand, because the high energy community wouldn\u2019t give them any respect for it. In this case there might be huge social benefits from paying them to do so. My own guess is that we leave a lot of low hanging fruit hanging, and that picking it is more important than worrying about the transfers.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<h1 id=\"_1__Note_\">-1. Note\u00a0</h1>\n<div>I have omitted any discussion of how certificates might be implemented, especially discussion of how you might get from here to there. This is a tough problem, but I think that a single advocate could make meaningful headway if it seemed worthwhile. I\u2019m interested in the prior question, is it a \u201cthere\u201d worth thinking about?</div></div></div>"},
{"date": "30th Sep 2014", "title": "Why is effective altruism new and obvious?", "author": "Katja_Grace", "num_comments": "34 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/ea-critique\">Ben Kuhn</a>, playing Devil's advocate:</p>\n<blockquote>Effective altruists often express surprise that the idea of effective altruism only came about so recently. For instance, my student group recently hosted Elie Hassenfeld for a talk in which he made remarks to that effect, and I\u2019ve heard other people working for EA organizations express the same sentiment. But no one seems to be actually worried about this\u2014just smug that they\u2019ve figured out something that no one else had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The \u201cmarket\u201d for ideas is at least somewhat efficient: most simple, obvious and correct things get thought of fairly quickly after it\u2019s possible to think them. If a meme as simple as effective altruism hasn\u2019t taken root yet, we should at least try to understand why before throwing our weight behind it. The absence of such attempts\u2014in other words, the fact that non-obviousness doesn\u2019t make effective altruists worried that they\u2019re missing something\u2014is a strong indicator against the \u201ceffective altruists are actually trying\u201d hypothesis.</blockquote>\n<p>I think this is a good point.\u00a0If you find yourself in a small group\u00a0advocating for an obvious and timeless idea, and it's 2014, something a bit strange is probably going on. As a side note, if people actually come out and\u00a0disagree, this is more worrying\u00a0and you should really take some time out to be puzzled by it.</p>\n<p>I can think of a few\u00a0reasons that 'effective altruism' might seem so obvious and yet the EA movement might only just be starting.</p>\n<p>I will assume that\u00a0the term 'effective altruism' is intended to mean\u00a0roughly\u00a0what the words in it suggest: helping other people in\u00a0efficient ways. If you took\u00a0'effective altruism' to be defined by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#Principles\">principles</a> regarding\u00a0counterfactual reasons and supererogatory\u00a0acts and so on, I don't think you should\u00a0be surprised that\u00a0it is\u00a0a new movement. However I don't think that's what 'effective altruism' generally means to people; rather\u00a0these recent principles are\u00a0an upshot of\u00a0people's\u00a0efforts to be\u00a0altruistic in an effective manner.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Explanation_1__Turning_something_into_a_social_movement_is_a_higher_bar_than_thinking_of_it\">Explanation 1: Turning something\u00a0into a social movement is a higher bar than thinking of it</strong></p>\n<p>Perhaps people have thought of effective altruism\u00a0before, and they just didn't make much noise about it. Perhaps even because it was obviously correct.\u00a0There is no temptation to start\u00a0a 'safe childcare' movement because\u00a0people generally come up with that on their own (whether or not they actually carry it out).\u00a0On the other hand, if\u00a0an idea is too obviously correct for anyone to\u00a0advocate for, you might expect more people to actually be doing it, or trying to do it. I'm not sure how many people were trying to be effective altruists\u00a0in the past on their own, but\u00a0I don't think it was a\u00a0large fraction.</p>\n<p>However\u00a0there might be some\u00a0other reason that people would think of the idea, but fail to spread it.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Explanation_2__There_are_lots_of_obvious_things__and_it_takes_some_insight_to_pick_the_important_ones_to_emphasize\"><strong>Explanation 2: </strong>There are lots of obvious things, and it takes some\u00a0insight to pick the important ones to emphasize</strong></p>\n<p>Consider an analogy to my life. Suppose that after having been a human\u00a0for many years\u00a0I\u00a0decide to exercise\u00a0regularly\u00a0and\u00a0go to sleep at the same time every night. In some sense, these things are obvious, perhaps because my housemates and parents and the media have pointed them out to me on a regular basis basically since I could walk and sleep for whole nights at a time. So perhaps I should not be surprised if these make my life hugely better.\u00a0However\u00a0my acquaintences\u00a0have also pointed out so many other 'obvious' things - that I should avoid salt\u00a0and learn the piano and be\u00a0nice and eat vitamin tablets\u00a0and wear make up and\u00a0so on - that it's hard to pick out the really high priority things from the rest, and each one takes scarce effort to implement and try out.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, similarly, while 'effectiveness' and 'altruism' are obvious, so are 'tenacity' and 'wealth' and 'sustainability' and so on. This would explain the world taking a very long time to get to them. However it would also suggest\u00a0that we haven't necessarily picked the right obvious things to emphasize.</p>\n<p>If\u00a0this were\u00a0the explanation, I would expect\u00a0everyone to basically be on board with the idea, just not to emphasize it as\u00a0a central principle in their life.\u00a0I'm not sure to what extent this is true.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Explanation_3__Effectiveness_and_altruism_don_t_appear_to_be_the_contentious_points\"><strong>Explanation 3: Effectiveness and altruism don't appear\u00a0to be the\u00a0contentious points</strong></strong></p>\n<p>Empirically, I think this is why 'effective altruism' didn't stand out to me as an important concept prior to meeting the Effective Altruists.</p>\n<p>As\u00a0a teen, I was interested\u00a0in\u00a0giving all of my money to the most cost-effective charities (or rather, saving it to give later). It was also clear that virtually everyone else\u00a0disagreed with me on this, which seemed a bit perplexing given their purported high valuation of human lives and the purported low cost of saving them. So I did actually think about our disagreement\u00a0quite a bit. It did not occur to me to advocate for 'effectiveness' or 'altruism' or both of them in concert, I think because\u00a0these did not stand out as the ideas\u00a0that people were\u00a0disagreeing over. My family\u00a0was interested in altruism some of the time, and seemed reasonably effective in their efforts. As far as I could tell, where we differed in opinion was in something like whether \u00a0people in foreign countries really existed in the same sense as people you can see do; whether\u00a0it was 'okay' in some sense to\u00a0buy a socially sanctioned\u00a0amount of stuff, regardless of the opportunity costs; or\u00a0whether one should have inconsistent beliefs.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Explanation_4__The_disagreement_isn_t_about_effectiveness_or_altruism\"><strong>Explanation 4: </strong>The disagreement isn't about effectiveness or altruism</strong></p>\n<p>A salient next hypothesis then is that the contentious claim made by Effective Altruism\u00a0is in fact not about effectiveness or altruism, and is less obvious.</p>\n<p>'Effective' and 'altruism' together\u00a0sound almost tautologically good. Altruism is\u00a0good for the world almost by definition, and if you are going to be altruistic, you would be a fool to be ineffective at it.</p>\n<p>In practice, Effective Altruism advocates for\u00a0measurement and comparison.\u00a0If measurement and comparison were free,\u00a0this would obviously be a good idea. However since they are not, effective altruism stands for putting more scarce resources into measurement and comparison, when\u00a0measurement is hard, comparison is demoralizing and politically fraught, and there are many other plausible ways that in practice philanthropy could be improved. For instance, perhaps it's\u00a0more effective to get more donors to talk to each other, or to\u00a0improve the effectiveness of foundation staff at menial tasks. We don't know, because at this meta level we haven't actually measured whether\u00a0measuring\u00a0things is the most effective thing to do. It seems very plausible, but\u00a0this is a much easier thing to imagine a person reasonably disagreeing with.</p>\n<p>Effective altruists sometimes criticize\u00a0people who look to overhead ratios and other simple metrics of performance, because\u00a0of course these are not the\u00a0important thing. We should care about results. If there is a charity that gets better results, but has a worse overhead ratio, we should still choose it! Who knew? As far as I can tell, this misses the point. Indeed, overhead ratio is not the same as quality. But surely nobody was suggesting that it was. If you were perfectly\u00a0informed about outcomes, indeed you should ignore overhead ratios. If you are ignorant about everything, overhead ratios are a gazillion times\u00a0cheaper\u00a0to get hold of than data on results. According to this <a href=\"http://overheadmyth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/GS_OverheadMyth_Ltr_ONLINE.pdf\">open letter</a>, overhead ratios are 'inaccurate and imprecise' because 75-85% of organizations incorrectly report their spending on grants. However this means that 15-25% report it correctly, which in my experience is a lot more than even try to\u00a0report their impact, let alone do it correctly. Again, the question of whether to use\u00a0heuristics like this seems like an empirical one of relative costs and accuracies,\u00a0where it is\u00a0not at all obvious that we are correct.</p>\n<p>Then there appear to be real disagreements about ethics and values. Other people think of themselves as having different values to Effective Altruists, not as merely liking their aggregative consequentialism to be ineffective. They\u00a0care more about the\u00a0people around them than those far away, or they care more about some kinds of problems than others, and they care about how things are done, not just the outcome. Given the large number of\u00a0ethical disagreements in the world, and unpopularity of utilitarianism, it is hardly a new surprise\u00a0that others don't find\u00a0this aspect of Effective Altruism\u00a0obviously good.</p>\n<p>If\u00a0Effective Altruism really stands for pursuing unusual\u00a0values,\u00a0and furthermore doing this via\u00a0zealous\u00a0emphasis on accurate metrics, I'm not especially surprised that it wasn't thought of\u00a0years ago, nor that people disagree.  If this is true though, I fear that we are\u00a0using <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/07/social-justice-and-words-words-words/\">impolite debate\u00a0tactics</a>.</p></div></div>"},

{"date": "30th Dec 2014", "title": "The perspectives on effective altruism we don't hear", "author": "Jess_Whittlestone", "num_comments": "33 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>This is my contribution to the December blogging carnival on \"blind spots.\"</em></p>\n<p>If I\u2019d heard about effective altruism in different circumstances, I think I could have reacted quite negatively to the whole concept. If I\u2019d been introduced to the idea of effective altruism by a friend who put a slightly negative spin on it, saying it was cold or overly demanding or something, I can totally imagine myself forming a negative impression. I\u2019d be surprised if I were the only person for whom this were true.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we should be thinking more about how the ideas of effective altruism might be - and are being - perceived by different people, to ensure that people like me don\u2019t end up being put off. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t spend any time thinking about this - there\u2019s certainly a fair amount of talk about how to \u201cpitch\u201d or \u201cframe\u201d effective altruism and giving. But most of this discussion is internal - just a bunch of people who are already convinced by EA talking about how it might be perceived. As objective as we can try to be, there\u2019s obviously a massive selection bias here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_opinions_we_don_t_hear\">The opinions we don\u2019t hear</h2>\n<p>My friend <a href=\"/www.uribram.com\">Uri Bram</a> recently wrote a great little article for Quartz called \u201c <a href=\"http://qz.com/290784/the-most-important-person-at-your-company-doesnt-work-for-you/\"> The most important person at your company doesn\u2019t work for you </a> .\u201d He makes the following point: the people who stay working at your company are a very non-random sample of all the people who could possibly work for you, obviously - they\u2019re likely to be those who feel most positively about the company. This means that if you only seek feedback from your current employees, you\u2019ll likely get the impression that things are going pretty much fine. It\u2019s the people who left the company, or who never applied in the first place, who are most likely to have useful information about the company\u2019s shortcomings.</p>\n<p>I think the same point applies to the EA movement. If we want to really get an accurate picture of the shortcomings and possible failure modes of the movement, we need to do more than talk about it ourselves (although this is certainly useful.) We also need to actively seek out feedback from people who aren\u2019t already convinced by EA, people who have a negative impression of EA, or perhaps people who were initially interested but were put off by something, or just didn\u2019t get more involved. I can think of plenty of people like this myself, and yet I\u2019m not spending much time asking for their opinions and considering them as valuable, relevant feedback.</p>\n<p>Maybe you\u2019re already doing this much more than me - I\u2019m sure some people are, and that\u2019s great. But I also think it\u2019s not something we\u2019ve prioritised or talked much about explicitly as a group. This is surprising, in a way - seeking negative feedback is such an obviously useful thing. So why aren\u2019t we doing this more?</p>\n<h2 id=\"Valuing_feedback_isn_t_enough\">Valuing feedback isn\u2019t enough</h2>\n<p>One possible explanation is just that seeking criticism is a psychologically difficult thing to do. I think this is definitely at least part of what\u2019s going on. Most effective altruists I know really value feedback and criticism - much more than the average person - and are much better at seeking feedback than most as a result. But we\u2019re all still human, and so for most of us, having our beliefs challenged still feels unpleasant sometimes. It feels especially unpleasant when it comes to issues that are close to your identity or social group - which is certainly the case for many with effective altruism.</p>\n<p>Another, related problem is that it\u2019s easy to immediately write off people who react negatively to EA as \u201cjust not like us.\u201d This isn\u2019t an explicit thing, but it can happen implicitly - I\u2019ve noticed myself thinking something like this. Someone criticises some element of effective altruism and I\u2019ll find myself writing their comment off with a thought like \u201cthey just don\u2019t really get it\u201d, or \u201cthey\u2019re biased because x\u201d, or \u201cthey\u2019re not really the kind of person we\u2019d expect to be interested.\u201d I\u2019ve had some fairly heated discussions with my parents about the GWWC pledge, for example - they don\u2019t particularly like the idea of me donating a substantial proportion of my earnings right now for various reasons. When we initially had these conversations, I mostly wrote off their comments as \u201cthem just not getting it\u201d at best, and \u201cthem being crazy unreasonable\u201d at worst. It\u2019s only recently that I\u2019ve started to see these conversations as a useful piece of feedback - both a different perspective on how I should prioritise my spending, and on how certain ideas might be off-putting to others. This doesn\u2019t mean I have to agree with them, but I do now see that their perspective is useful for me to understand.</p>\n<p>Rejecting something someone else says with \u201cthey don\u2019t get it\u201d or \u201cthey\u2019re being unreasonable\u201d is essentially a defensive reaction. What this misses is that every piece of feedback - no matter how it\u2019s framed or where it comes from - contains useful information.</p>\n<p>Finally, actively seeking out feedback from others - especially those who aren\u2019t immediately within our social circle - can just be effortful. Even if you know that seeking feedback is a good idea and you\u2019re not actively avoiding it, it takes time and effort to actually go and ask questions, think about different perspectives, and to extract useful information from it. These conversations can also be awkward or lead to conflict. A big part of the reason I don\u2019t always talk to my family and friends about effective altruism is that I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m preaching, or get into a heated discussion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How_can_we_obtain_more_varied_perspectives_on_effective_altruism_\">How can we obtain more varied perspectives on effective altruism?</h2>\n<p>So what can we do, practically speaking, to reduce this selection effect and get more useful information about where the EA movement be going wrong? A few ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> <strong>See casual conversations with friends and family as an opportunity to learn about their perspective</strong> . If someone you\u2019re talking to isn\u2019t immediately taken in by an idea you\u2019re telling them about, it\u2019s natural to think you can either switch topic or try harder to persuade them. But there\u2019s a third option: you could try to better understand what their perspective is on what you\u2019re saying, and why it might not appeal to them. You might not agree with their perspective, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not useful. It\u2019s still their reaction, and others might have a similar one - and it\u2019s valuable for the effective altruism movement to see where these perspectives are coming from. </li>\n<li> <strong>Making more effort to understand the perspectives of those who are critical of effective altruism</strong> - people who write critical pieces online or argue in Facebook comments, for example. It\u2019s so natural to get on the defensive in these situations, but it\u2019s also so valuable to take a step back and ask: what is making them think or feel this way? Why does what I\u2019m saying seem wrong or triggering to them? How might their beliefs and values differ from mine to make this the case? </li>\n<li> <strong>Actively seeking out feedback from people who seem to have a negative or not-entirely-positive view of effective altruism</strong> . This could include a range of people: friends and family, those who have spoken out publicly in criticism, or perhaps people who we might expect to be aligned with effective altruism but don\u2019t appear that interested - there are a number of academics and public figures who might fit this description that it could be really valuable to talk to. </li>\n<li> <strong>Doing online studies and surveys to get more data on how people react to different framings of effective altruism</strong> . As I said at the beginning of this post, the way that messages are framed can make a massive difference to how people react to them. I think there\u2019s still a lot that we could learn about how people respond to different ways of talking about effective altruism, and the kinds of people who find the ideas most appealing. Running studies online is one way we could get a lot of information on this at relatively low cost. </li>\n</ol>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>I'd be interested in what others think - whether we should be focusing on getting more diverse perspectives, and, if so, what the best strategies for doing that are.</div></div></div>"},
{"date": "11th Mar 2014", "title": "The history of the term 'effective altruism'", "author": "William_MacAskill", "num_comments": "8 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>A few people have expressed interest recently in the origins of the effective altruism community. I realized that not that many people know where the term 'effective altruism' came from, nor that there was a painfully long amount of time spent deciding on it. And it was fun digging through the old emails. So here's an overview of what happened!</p><p>The need to decide upon a name came from two sources:</p><p>First, the <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> (GWWC) community was growing. <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a> (80k) had soft-launched in February 2011, moving the focus in Oxford away from just charity and onto ethical life-optimisation more generally. There was also a growing realization among the GWWC and 80k Directors that the best thing for us each to be doing was to encourage more people to use their life to do good as effectively as possible (which is now usually called 'movement-building').</p><p>Second, GWWC and 80k were planning to incorporate as a charity under an 'umbrella' name, so that we could take paid staff (decided approx. Aug 2011; I was Managing Director of GWWC at the time and was pushing for this, with Michelle Hutchinson and Holly Morgan as the first planned staff members). So we needed a name for that umbrella organization (the working title was 'High Impact Alliance'). We were also just starting to realize the importance of good marketing, and therefore willing to put more time into things like choice of name.</p><p>At the time, there were a host of related terms: on 12 March 2012 Jeff Kaufman <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/a-name-for-a-movement\">posted</a> on this, listing 'smart giving', 'efficient charity', 'optimal philanthropy', among others. Most of the terms these referred to charity specifically. The one term that was commonly used to refer to people who were trying to use their lives to do good effectively was the tongue-in-cheek 'super-hardcore do-gooder'. It was pretty clear we needed a new name! I summarized this in an email to the 80k team (then the 'High Impact Careers' team) on 13 October 2011:\n</p><blockquote>We need a name for \"someone who pursues a high impact lifestyle\". \u00a0This has been such an obstacle in the utilitarianesque community - 'do-gooder' is the current term, and it sucks.\"</blockquote>\nWhat happened, then, is that there was a period of brainstorming - combining different terms like 'effective', 'efficient', 'rational' with 'altruism', 'benevolence', 'charity'. Then the Directors of GWWC and 80k decided, in November 2011, to aggregate everyone's views and make a final decision by vote. This vote would decide both the name of the type of person we wanted to refer to, and for the name of the organization we were setting up.<p></p><p>Those who voted were as follows (I think, but am not certain, that this is complete):\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>Will MacAskill (then 'Crouch')</li>\n\t<li>Toby Ord</li>\n\t<li>Nick Beckstead</li>\n\t<li>Michelle Hutchinson</li>\n\t<li>Holly Morgan</li>\n\t<li>Mark Lee</li>\n\t<li>Tom Ash</li>\n\t<li>Matt Wage</li>\n\t<li>Ben Todd</li>\n\t<li>Tom Rowlands</li>\n\t<li>Niel Bowerman</li>\n\t<li>Robbie Shade</li>\n\t<li>Matt Gibb</li>\n\t<li>Richard Batty</li>\n\t<li>Sally Murray</li>\n\t<li>Rob Gledhill</li>\n\t<li>Andreas Mogensen</li>\n</ul>\nTom Rowlands, who was then Director of Communications for both GWWC and 80k, sent round the following email on 3 December 2011:\n<blockquote>I've been through all the suggestions on the umbrella name - thanks.The names that have arisen mostly reflect two components: an ethical position i.e. 'good' and optimizing this i.e. 'maximisation'We might also want a name for 'group'.[I've deliberately used the above words as they didn't arise in the suggestions, to avoid bias.]For these reasons, I've split the voting into three parts, based on these categories - to do otherwise would make it almost incoherent. The downside is this doesn't really account for acronyms and combinations (you might like three of the terms in isolation, but don't like them as a group).So, please consider the options in the three categories, before coming up with up to three names you like together:e.g. Good Maximisation Group<p></p><p>1:</p><p>a) altruist\nb) do-gooder\nc) utilitarian\nd) humanist\ne) empathetic\nf) philanthropist\ng) consequentialist\nh) positive\ni) benetarian</p><p>2:</p><p>a) hardcore\nb) dedicated\nc) rational\nd) professional\ne) optimal\nf) high impact\ng) evidence-based\nh) effective\ni) biggest</p><p>3:</p><p>a) alliance\nb) group\nc) centre\nd) community\ne) institute\nf) network\ng) association</p><p>You might not think all three components are necessary, in which case just use the ones you think are e.g. Good Maximisers.</p><p>If you completely disagree with the methodology, please say so and I'll come up with another. I did spend some time considering this!</p><p>Sorry we haven't got to the voting yet, but it seemed like this is a necessary step on the way there.</p><p>Please send me your ideas by 2100 Sunday. I'll then send another email with a shortlist to vote on. [Michelle - I hope this meets the deadline; sorry if not)</p><p>From non-snowy Val Thorens,</p><p>Tom</p></blockquote>\nAnd on 5 December 2011 there was a vote, for what the name of the new umbrella organization should be. The shortlist was:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Rational Altruist Community RAC</li>\n\t<li>Effective Utilitarian Community EUC</li>\n\t<li>Evidence-based Charity Association ECA</li>\n\t<li>Alliance for Rational Compassion ARC</li>\n\t<li>Evidence-based Philanthropy Association EPA</li>\n\t<li>High Impact Alliance HIA</li>\n\t<li>Association for Evidence-Based Altruism AEA</li>\n\t<li>Optimal Altruism Network OAN</li>\n\t<li>High Impact Altruist Network HIAN</li>\n\t<li>Rational Altruist Network RAN</li>\n\t<li>Association of Optimal Altruists AON</li>\n\t<li>Centre for Effective Altruism CEA</li>\n\t<li>Centre for Rational Altruism CRA</li>\n\t<li>Big Visions Network BVN</li>\n\t<li>Optimal Altruists Forum OAF</li>\n</ul>\n(There was actually two other votes, too: one on whether to use 'Effective' rather than 'rational' or 'strategic'; and one on whether to use 'Centre' rather than anything else. Tom expressed how arduous the name-decision process had been - after this list he said \"Again, apologies for the way this process has gone. I'll try to keep the last couple of days relatively pain-free.\"\u00a0\u00a0I remember Matt Wage commenting that he thought that this whole process was a really ineffective use of time. But it seems to have been worth it in retrospect!)<p></p><p>In the vote, CEA won, by quite a clear margin. Different people had been pushing for different names. I remember that Michelle preferred \"Rational Altruism\", the Leverage folks preferred \"Strategic Altruism,\" and I was pushing for '\"Effective Altruism\". But no-one had terribly strong views, so everyone was happy to go with the name we voted on. GiveWell was using \"rational altruism\" for a while after that point (e.g. <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/01/16/in-memory-of-aaron-swartz/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/02/15/self-evaluation-givewell-as-a-project-4/\">here</a>), before switching to \"effective altruism\".</p><p>We hadn't planned 'effective altruism' to take off in the way that it did. 'Centre for Effective Altruism' was intended not to have a public presence at all, and just be a legal entity. I had thought that effective altruism was too abstract an idea for it to really catch on, and had a disagreement with Mark Lee and Geoff Anders about this. Time proved them correct on that point!</p><p>After that, the term was used progressively more, as 80,000 Hours started using it (e.g. <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/31-what-is-an-effective-altruist\">this</a> was the go-to page on effective altruism for quite a while, published 5th March 2012) and <a href=\"http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/\">THINK</a> was set up to promote effective altruism specifically. Ruair\u00ed Donnelly set up the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/\">Effective Altruists Facebook group</a> in November 2012. Then I think what really solidified the term was Peter Singer's TED talk, which was filmed in March 2013, and posted on-line in May 2013.</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "9th Sep 2014", "title": "The Drowning Child and the Expanding Circle", "author": "Introduction", "num_comments": "28 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span><em>by Peter Singer in New Internationalist, April, 1997</em></span></p>\n\n<p>To challenge my students to think about the ethics of what we owe to people in need, I ask them to imagine that their route to the university takes them past a shallow pond. One morning, I say to them, you notice a child has fallen in and appears to be drowning. To wade in and pull the child out would be easy but it will mean that you get your clothes wet and muddy, and by the time you go home and change you will have missed your first class.</p>\n<p>I then ask the students: do you have any obligation to rescue the child? Unanimously, the students say they do. The importance of saving a child so far outweighs the cost of getting one\u2019s clothes muddy and missing a class, that they refuse to consider it any kind of excuse for not saving the child. Does it make a difference, I ask, that there are other people walking past the pond who would equally be able to rescue the child but are not doing so? No, the students reply, the fact that others are not doing what they ought to do is no reason why I should not do what I ought to do.</p>\n<p>Once we are all clear about our obligations to rescue the drowning child in front of us, I ask: would it make any difference if the child were far away, in another country perhaps, but similarly in danger of death, and equally within your means to save, at no great cost \u2013 and absolutely no danger \u2013 to yourself? Virtually all agree that distance and nationality make no moral difference to the situation. I then point out that we are all in that situation of the person passing the shallow pond: we can all save lives of people, both children and adults, who would otherwise die, and we can do so at a very small cost to us: the cost of a new CD, a shirt or a night out at a restaurant or concert, can mean the difference between life and death to more than one person somewhere in the world \u2013 and overseas aid agencies like Oxfam overcome the problem of acting at a distance.</p>\n<p>At this point the students raise various practical difficulties. Can we be sure that our donation will really get to the people who need it? Doesn\u2019t most aid get swallowed up in administrative costs, or waste, or downright corruption? Isn\u2019t the real problem the growing world population, and is there any point in saving lives until the problem has been solved? These questions can all be answered: but I also point out that even if a substantial proportion of our donations were wasted, the cost to us of making the donation is so small, compared to the benefits that it provides when it, or some of it, does get through to those who need our help, that we would still be saving lives at a small cost to ourselves \u2013 even if aid organizations were much less efficient than they actually are.</p>\n<p>I am always struck by how few students challenge the underlying ethics of the idea that we ought to save the lives of strangers when we can do so at relatively little cost to ourselves. At the end of the nineteenth century WH Lecky wrote of human concern as an expanding circle which begins with the individual, then embraces the family and \u2018soon the circle... includes first a class, then a nation, then a coalition of nations, then all humanity, and finally, its influence is felt in the dealings of man [sic] with the animal world\u2019.1 On this basis the overwhelming majority of my students seem to be already in the penultimate stage \u2013 at least \u2013 of Lecky\u2019s expanding circle. There is, of course, for many students and for various reasons a gap between acknowledging what we ought to do, and doing it; but I shall come back to that issue shortly.</p>\n<p>Our century is the first in which it has been possible to speak of global responsibility and a global community. For most of human history we could affect the people in our village, or perhaps in a large city, but even a powerful king could not conquer far beyond the borders of his kingdom. When Hadrian ruled the Roman Empire, his realm covered most of the \u2018known\u2019 world, but today when I board a jet in London leaving what used to be one of the far-flung outposts of the Roman Empire, I pass over its opposite boundary before I am even halfway to Singapore, let alone to my home in Australia. Moreover no matter what the extent of the empire, the time required for communications and transport meant that there was simply no way in which people could make any difference to the victims of floods, wars, or massacres taking place on the other side of the globe. By the time anyone had heard of the events and responded, the victims were dead or had survived without assistance. \u2018Charity begins at home\u2019 made sense, because it was only \u2018at home\u2019 \u2013 or at least in your own town \u2013 that you could be confident that your charity would make any difference.</p>\n<p>Instant communications and jet transport have changed all that. A television audience of two billion people can now watch hungry children beg for food in an area struck by famine, or they can see refugees streaming across the border in search of a safe place away from those they fear will kill them. Most of that huge audience also have the means to help people they are seeing on their screens. Each one of us can pull out a credit card and phone in a donation to an aid organization which can, in a few days, fly in people who can begin distributing food and medical supplies. Collectively, it is also within the capacity of the United Nations \u2013 with the support of major powers \u2013 to put troops on the ground to protect those who are in danger of becoming victims of genocide.</p>\n<p>Our capacity to affect what is happening, anywhere in the world, is one way in which we are living in an era of global responsibility. But there is also another way that offers an even more dramatic contrast with the past. The atmosphere and the oceans seemed, until recently, to be elements of nature totally unaffected by the puny activities of human beings. Now we know that our use of chlorofluorocarbons has damaged the ozone shield; our emission of carbon dioxide is changing the climate of the entire planet in unpredictable ways and raising the level of the sea; and fishing fleets are scouring the oceans, depleting fish populations that once seemed limitless to a point from which they may never recover. In these ways the actions of consumers in Los Angeles can cause skin cancer among Australians, inundate the lands of peasants in Bangladesh, and force Thai villagers who could once earn a living by fishing to work in the factories of Bangkok.</p>\n<p>In these circumstances the need for a global ethic is inescapable. Is it nevertheless a vain hope? Here are some reasons why it may not be.</p>\n<p>We live in a time when many people experience their lives as empty and lacking in fulfilment. The decline of religion and the collapse of communism have left but the ideology of the free market whose only message is: consume, and work hard so you can earn money to consume more. Yet even those who do reasonably well in this race for material goods do not find that they are satisfied with their way of life. We now have good scientific evidence for what philosophers have said throughout the ages: once we have enough to satisfy our basic needs, gaining more wealth does not bring us more happiness.</p>\n<p>Consider the life of Ivan Boesky, the multimillionaire Wall Street dealer who in 1986 pleaded guilty to insider trading. Why did Boesky get involved in criminal activities when he already had more money than he could ever spend? Six years after the insider-trading scandal broke, Boesky\u2019s estranged wife Seema spoke about her husband\u2019s motives in an interview with Barbara Walters for the American ABC Network\u2019s 20/20 program. Walters asked whether Boesky was a man who craved luxury. Seema Boesky thought not, pointing out that he worked around the clock, seven days a week, and never took a day off to enjoy his money. She then recalled that when in 1982 Forbes magazine first listed Boesky among the wealthiest people in the US, he was upset. She assumed he disliked the publicity and made some remark to that effect. Boesky replied: \u2018That\u2019s not what\u2019s upsetting me. We\u2019re no-one. We\u2019re nowhere. We\u2019re at the bottom of the list and I promise you I won\u2019t shame you like that again. We will not remain at the bottom of that list.\u2019</p>\n<p>We must free ourselves from this absurd conception of success. Not only does it fail to bring happiness even to those who, like Boesky, do extraordinarily well in the competitive struggle; it also sets a social standard that is a recipe for global injustice and environmental disaster. We cannot continue to see our goal as acquiring more and more wealth, or as consuming more and more goodies, and leaving behind us an even larger heap of waste.</p>\n<p>We tend to see ethics as opposed to self-interest; we assume that those who make fortunes from insider trading are successfully following self-interest \u2013 as long as they don\u2019t get caught \u2013 and ignoring ethics. We think that it is in our interest to take a more senior better-paid position with another company, even though it means that we are helping to manufacture or promote a product that does no good at all, or is environmentally damaging. On the other hand, those who pass up opportunities to rise in their career because of ethical \u2018scruples\u2019 about the nature of the work, or who give away their wealth to good causes, are thought to be sacrificing their own interest in order to obey the dictates of ethics.</p>\n<p>Many will say that it is naive to believe that people could shift from a life based on consumption, or on getting on top of the corporate ladder, to one that is more ethical in its fundamental direction. But such a shift would answer a palpable need. Today the assertion that life is meaningless no longer comes from existentialist philosophers who treat it as a shocking discovery: it comes from bored adolescents for whom it is a truism. Perhaps it is the central place of self-interest, and the way in which we conceive of our own interest, that is to blame here. The pursuit of self-interest, as standardly conceived, is a life without any meaning beyond our own pleasure or individual satisfaction. Such a life is often a self-defeating enterprise. The ancients knew of the \u2018paradox of hedonism\u2019, according to which the more explicitly we pursue our desire for pleasure, the more elusive we will find its satisfaction. There is no reason to believe that human nature has changed so dramatically as to render the ancient wisdom inapplicable.</p>\n<p>Here ethics offer a solution. An ethical life is one in which we identify ourselves with other, larger, goals, thereby giving meaning to our lives. The view that there is harmony between ethics and enlightened self-interest is an ancient one, now often scorned. Cynicism is more fashionable than idealism. But such hopes are not groundless, and there are substantial elements of truth in the ancient view that an ethically reflective life is also a good life for the person leading it. Never has it been so urgent that the reasons for accepting this view should be widely understood.</p>\n<p>In a society in which the narrow pursuit of material self-interest is the norm, the shift to an ethical stance is more radical than many people realize. In comparison with the needs of people going short of food in Rwanda, the desire to sample the wines of Australia\u2019s best vineyards pales into insignificance. An ethical approach to life does not forbid having fun or enjoying food and wine; but it changes our sense of priorities. The effort and expense put into fashion, the endless search for more and more refined gastronomic pleasures, the added expense that marks out the luxury-car market \u2013 all these become disproportionate to people who can shift perspective long enough to put themselves in the position of others affected by their actions. If the circle of ethics really does expand, and a higher ethical consciousness spreads, it will fundamentally change the society in which we live.</p>\n<p>Part of <a href=\"/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/\">Introduction to Effective Altruism</a></p>\n<p>Next: <a href=\"/ea/6v/scope_insensitivity/\">Scope Insensitivity</a></p></div></div>"},

Project</span></a></h2>\n<h2 id=\"Introduction\"><span>Introduction</span></h2>\n<p><span>During the past year the Centre for Effective Altruism has been engaged in ongoing policy discussions with policymakers in the UK Government. \u00a0We generated hundreds of policy options and had many meetings with policymakers within the UK Government, both party political advisors, politicians and civil servants. \u00a0This post describes some of our learnings from this process. \u00a0These learnings will probably be obvious to anyone with experience of the policy-making process, but I hope that discussing them in more detail will be useful for people less familiar with policy making who attempt to do policy work going forwards. \u00a0This work was primarily carried out by Toby Ord, Nick Beckstead, William MacAskill, Owen Cotton-Barratt, Robert Wiblin, Haydn Belfield, and myself. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>One of our motivations for engaging in this work is that developed countries\u2019 governments typically control budgets of the order of a trillion $US ($10^12</span><span>) per year, and so moving a small portion of this budget could result in large amounts of money moved to effective causes. \u00a0Paul Christiano discusses the potential value of engaging in politics in more detail </span><a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/310-an-estimate-of-the-expected-influence-of-becoming-a-politician\"><span>here</span></a><span>. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Over the past year we have devised many outlines for possible policies which aimed to, among other things, reduce poverty, reduce animal suffering, improve decision making, improve scientific progress, or reduce extinction risk. \u00a0The policymakers thought that many of these policies were promising or interesting, but weren\u2019t excited enough about any specific initiatives to really push for them. \u00a0The overwhelming majority of the proposals that we presented were set aside by policymakers without further investigation. \u00a0Most of those initiatives that were investigated further had problems associated with them, did not provide the benefits that we were initially hoping for, or simply weren\u2019t promising enough for the policymakers to push for them publicly. \u00a0While we will not be making the full list public at this time, there are a number of themes that emerged from the policies that were not taken up. \u00a0</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"Political_feasibility\"><span>Political feasibility</span></h2>\n<p><span>The most common reason for policies to be rejected was because they were politically infeasible. \u00a0We realised that the initiatives that were most likely to progress were those that would incur little to no financial or political cost to the politicians. \u00a0It may be possible to overcome the preference for zero or low financial and political cost by building supporting coalitions, but I will save the discussion for </span><a

id=\"Financial_cost\"><span>Financial cost</span></h3>\n<p><span>Many of the policies and initiatives we suggested were rejected because they would cost Government money. \u00a0Policies ruled out for this reason included:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Funding research to </span><a href=\"http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Tetlock%202-12-14%20(public).pdf\"><span>improve

catastrophic risks</span></a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Others were rejected because they would cost some voters money, even if they would save more money for others. \u00a0Policies ruled out for this reason included:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Taxing all non-free-range meat products</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Stopping subsidies of certain agricultural products</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Political_cost\"><span>Political cost</span></h3>\n<p><span>Many policies were ruled out because of the political, financial and time opportunity cost. \u00a0One way of conceiving of this objection is that the policymakers were unwilling to spend </span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_capital\"><span>political capital</span></a><span> because they had more promising ways in which to spend their time and money.</span><span> \u00a0This could be because the policy was weird, unpopular, or could be blocked by special interest groups. \u00a0Policies that were ruled out for these reasons include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Creating more </span><a

policy\u2019)</span></h4>\n<p><span>During my years as a climate scientist and campaigner, I had many opportunities to see scientists attempting to engage in policy poorly. \u00a0I would often see scientists:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Identify a problem, e.g. climate change due to increasing EU road transport CO</span><span>2</span><span> emissions</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Identify a possible response, e.g. reduce EU road transport emissions</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Identify a possible policy, e.g. require some fraction of EU petrol to come from EU biofuels</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Promote this policy</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol><br>\n<p><span>One of the problems with this approach is that the scientists have not engaged in policy analysis, for example by</span><span>:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Identifying all of the other possible policy responses,</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Defining our aims, not just in the specific area the policy is addressing, but also in terms of limiting other potentially negative consequences of the policy,</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Estimating how well these possible policies achieve our aims,</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>And assessing the trade-offs between the policies to identify the best policy. \u00a0</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><span>Another problem is that they have not analysed the political landscape or initiated stakeholder engagement, for example by:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Speaking with different stakeholders to determine how much support and opposition there is for these different policies</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Considered tweaking the policy in a number of ways to bring potential allies on board and neutralise potential opponents</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Used tools such as power matrices to estimate whether it would be possible to build a coalition influential enough to push any of these policies through to implementation. \u00a0</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><span>By moving straight from step three to four above we ignore key aspects of the policy-making process and end up promoting policies that are usually sub-optimal from an efficiency perspective, and are also politically infeasible. \u00a0</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>One way in which scientists can engage with the political process successfully is by proposing their policy and \u2018passing the baton\u2019 on to policy analysts who can then compare it to the other policies on the table. \u00a0But the scientist should not be surprised if their policy turns out to be sub-optimal or politically infeasible. \u00a0Indeed this is probably the most likely outcome for a policy that has been proposed by someone who is not an expert in this policy area. \u00a0However if the policy analyst is in favour of the idea, a powerful partnership can develop in which the scientist acts as a scientific advisor to an ongoing policy development process. \u00a0One example of this occurring is the role that Dr. Drew Shindell played in the development of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, which was largely developed by the US State Department with Dr. Shindell acting as a scientific advisor to the process. \u00a0</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>Note that Kingdon\u2019s </span><a href=\"http://www.fsu.edu/~pea/Multiple_Streams.html\"><span>\u2018multiple streams\u2019</span></a><span> model of policy change suggests that </span><a href=\"http://ww2.publicpolicy.utoronto.ca/ppgr/PPGGlossary/PQ/PolicyWindow/Pages/default.aspx\"><span>\u2018policy windows\u2019</span></a><span> caused by the shifting political landscape could allow previously-rejected policies to be implemented. \u00a0Under this model a scientist who is unable to tell when a policy window has opened could have success in continuously promoting policy over a long period of time and hoping that at some point a policy window may open. \u00a0An example of where this may have occurred is in the story that is told about the creation of an observational program to monitor ocean currents in the North Atlantic. \u00a0These measurements had been desired by the scientific community for some time, but according to this story it was not until a scientist mentioned the problem of a potential slow-down in the ocean currents and the need to monitor them to then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair that funding became available for the programme. \u00a0</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>A potentially more effective option for the scientists pushing for their policy continuously would be for them to ally with a policy analyst with more expertise in analysing the political landscape, who could monitor the landscape and report back to the scientist if a policy window opens or has a chance of opening soon. \u00a0This may have been the case with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, which some commentators said was Obama\u2019s attempt to claim a success in tackling climate change in the run up to the 2012 general election in order to woo back environmental voters who had been unimpressed by his record on climate change to date. \u00a0This policy window may have caused policy analysts at the State Department to implement Dr. Shindell, and others\u2019 long-standing policy recommendations. </span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>There is plenty more work that needs doing in identifying possible responses to problems that effective altruism community has identified (i.e. in step two above), before the community can focus the majority of its efforts on proposing policies (see step three). \u00a0However, if the effective altruism community would like to do some of this policy analysis, political landscape analysis and stakeholder engagement itself rather than relying on busy and potentially disinterested policy analysts and campaign strategists, we will need to develop expertise in these areas. \u00a0</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"More_initiatives_that_won_t_work__yet_\"><span>More initiatives that won\u2019t work (yet)</span></h2>\n<p><span>Once the majority of our proposals had been ruled out due to not being clearly politically feasible, we had a much smaller number of options to investigate further. \u00a0Of these, several failed because they were too advanced relative to our current understanding, and required a majority to support them. \u00a0I discuss two examples in more detail below. \u00a0</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"An_Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Biotechnological_Risk\"><span>An Intergovernmental Panel on Biotechnological Risk</span></h3>\n<h4 id=\"The_proposal\"><span>The proposal</span></h4>\n<p><span>Set up a body, modelled on to the </span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change\"><span>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</span></a><span> (IPCC), to synthesise knowledge on biotechnological risks. \u00a0</span></p>\n<h4 id=\"The_appeal\"><span>The appeal</span></h4>\n<p><span>The IPCC had a huge impact on the climate change debate, and even won a Nobel peace prize </span><span>\"for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change\"</span><span>. \u00a0Presumably an Intergovernmental Panel on Biotechnological Risk could do the same for biotechnological risk? \u00a0</span></p>\n<h4 id=\"The_stumbling_blocks\"><span>The stumbling blocks</span></h4>\n<p><span>The IPCC was set up by the scientific community to illustrate to the world that there was a scientific consensus on climate change. \u00a0The IPCC does not do original research, and does not progress the field other than by recording the state of climate science research every six or seven years. \u00a0The consensus in the field on what to do about the risks arising from biotechnology is not as uniform as the state of climate science was when the IPCC was set up.</span><span> \u00a0There are still a wide range of views on questions such as whether certain types of potentially dangerous research should be undertaken, and whether creating novel dangerous pathogens in the lab is overall a net harm. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>My understanding from </span><a href=\"http://cisac.stanford.edu/people/stephen_j_stedman/\"><span>Prof. Steve Stedman</span></a><span>, former Assistant Secretary General to the United Nations, is that he spoke with over fifty experts about the question of setting up an IPCC-equivalent body in this area and concluded that there were neither high-level experts willing to champion the initiative, nor was there a general feeling that the initiative would succeed, in part due to the lack of consensus.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>IPCC authors are not paid for their time, and so they either volunteer their time, or use funding from other grants to cover their costs. \u00a0This aspect also made the initiative unappealing to potential champions of the initiative. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Another problem is that the incentives are aligned rather differently. \u00a0When climate scientists raised the alarm about climate change, it did not curtail their research freedom, and increased the future funding to climate science. \u00a0If biotechnologists raise the alarm about biotech risk, their proposals will largely be imposing restrictions or large costs on their own and their peers\u2019 research. \u00a0Additionally, the overall effect may well be to reduce the total amount of funding to their area, though this is uncertain. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Prof. Stedman conducted the most in depth investigation to date of the possibility of setting up an IPCC for biotechnology risk. \u00a0He was convinced enough that it was unlikely to go ahead that after his investigation he returned the remainder of the funding that he had been given to set up the initiative and moved on to other things. \u00a0</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"House_of_Commons_Lords_Science_and_Technology_Committee_inquiry_into_unprecedented_technological_risk\"><span>House of Commons/Lords Science and Technology Committee inquiry into unprecedented technological risk</span></h3>\n<h4 id=\"The_proposal1\"><span>The proposal</span></h4>\n<p><span>The House of Commons/Lords Science and Technology Committee would run an inquiry into unprecedented technological risk, particularly focusing on its impact on existential risk. \u00a0</span></p>\n<h4 id=\"The_appeal1\"><span>The appeal</span></h4>\n<p><span>The Government must respond in writing to the committee\u2019s reports, and this could allow the committee to influence government policy on this issue. \u00a0We also hoped that we could use this as a way to cause people to investigate this issue and develop possible responses. </span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<h4 id=\"The_stumbling_blocks1\"><span>The stumbling blocks</span></h4>\n<p><span>House of Commons/Lords committees such as this one cannot do original research, and largely synthesise the views of the witnesses that they call on. \u00a0As there has been little research done into policy responses to existential risk, and there is no consensus in the area, it is unlikely that the committee would make strong recommendations to Government. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Additionally, in order to launch the inquiry we would need multiple sympathetic MPs or Lords on the committee. \u00a0The inquiry would need to be led by a particularly sympathetic member, and it would take up a large amount of their time. \u00a0This is time that could otherwise be put to potentially more useful initiatives. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>This may be a useful initiative to take up in future when there has been more research done into responses to unprecedented technological risks and their impact on existential risk, particularly once those responses have been developed into prioritised policy proposals. \u00a0</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"Communicating_expert_opinion\"><span>Communicating expert opinion</span></h3>\n<p><span>Both of these failed proposals are about communicating the majority view of experts to decision-makers and interested parties. \u00a0The reason they failed is because the field of existential risk reduction is so new that the majority of experts do not yet hold similar views on the issue. \u00a0For example, even within the </span><a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\"><span>Future of Humanity Institute</span></a><span> there is significant internal disagreement on key elements of what we should be doing to reduce existential risk. \u00a0This suggests there is much more research to be done in this area before we can start implementing many of our possible responses. \u00a0</span></p>\n<h2

href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Alternatives-Policies-Epilogue-Classics-Political/dp/020500086X\"><span>\u201cmultiple streams\u201d model</span></a><span>, which suggests that policies are only implemented when \u2018problems, policies and politics\u2019 align to create a window of opportunity. \u00a0Kingdon also introduces the idea of a </span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_entrepreneur\"><span>\u2018policy entrepreneur\u2019</span></a><span> as someone who seeks to gain benefits in exchange for implementing policies and initiatives that are popular. \u00a0Baumgartner and Jones </span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Agendas-Instability-American-Politics-Political/dp/0226039390\"><span>focus</span></a><span> on issue-definition and venue-shopping to suggest that issues usually follow a stable policy direction but that this stability is interjected with periods of rapid, unpredictable change. \u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Policy-Design-Democracy-Larason-Schneider/dp/0700608443\"><span>Schneider, Ingram</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Policy-Paradox-Political-Decision-Making/dp/0393976254\"><span>Stone</span></a><span> and others focus on issue framing as the factor which decides which policies are implemented and which are not. \u00a0These are just a small subset of the more popular models of the policymaking process which have been proposed. \u00a0These models cover different aspects of the decision-making process, and do not always agree where they overlap, as we might expect in a real-world process as complex as this one. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><a

model</span></a><span> of policy analysis is another model that we can use to frame our discussion of the policymaking process. \u00a0It is a simple model that I will discuss in more detail is I believe it can be used to illustrate the broader picture of why many of our policies were not taken up. \u00a0It was originally put forward by </span><a

factors. \u00a0For example, it ignores the political landscape and vested interests, and assumes the Government is a unitary rational actor in a static system</span><span>. \u00a0There is a literature of case studies both showing </span><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851096008895\"><span>benefits</span></a><span> and </span><a

of the rational model in different circumstances. \u00a0Nonetheless it can be helpful to us in providing a hypothesis as to why our policies were unworkable, and where we might focus our attention in the future. \u00a0</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"An_adapted_rational_model\"><span>An adapted rational model</span></h3>\n<p><span>The rational model has been adapted in a </span><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851096008895\"><span>number</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"http://www.msu.edu/course/prr/389/Pattonsawicki.doc\"><span>of</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/qr/qr1011.pdf\"><span>ways</span></a><span> throughout the </span><a href=\"http://cursodeposgrado.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/libro-sabatier.pdf\"><span>literature</span></a><span>. \u00a0Here I suggest an extension that may help explain some of our experience. \u00a0As with all models based on the rational model, it will have a number of shortfalls, but is hopefully still useful. \u00a0It proposes that policy development largely goes through the following stages:</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tBd2NRuOlRjvK7wKYUJUHJW6BQVKDHoIW9kGhYGLXtD3k0vX3JXfR-D_I0XGnXOC6i39wsorzXITpp7WB1zX-knhYXS0GkPBPjXkCLQAIPIMA4Xfbn8o7JaAh1MKtfm12A\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p><span>Like in the original rational model, stages can occur concurrently and stages can be skipped. \u00a0I make a distinction between responses (desired outcomes, e.g. reduce emissions), and policies (methods of achieving the desired outcomes, e.g. a cap and trade regime) as I did in the box</span><span> above. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>We can represent our progress towards a policy-based solution for a given problem in this model. \u00a0For example, on existential risk due to artificial intelligence, the community is perhaps working on gathering intelligence and identifying the problem (stages 1 and 2A), with limited work on identifying responses and building coalitions around the problem (stages 3A and 2B). \u00a0Thus it would not be as useful for the community to shift its attention to working on stages 4A, 3B, 4B or 5 at this point. \u00a0There may be space for individuals to do pioneering work in these areas, but in general the model would suggest that they will find progress easier once more progress has been made in the previous stages. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>On climate change mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions) in the UK, most of the work that remains to be done is on developing policies, building coalitions around various responses and policies and attempting get those policies implemented (stages 4A, 3B, 4B and 5). \u00a0This is one of the reasons I moved away from being a climate scientist, where I was predominantly working on stage one. \u00a0This is not to say that there is no more work to be done in this area; further highlighting the dangers from climate change is still useful, just perhaps not as useful as well-directed work in the policy arena. \u00a0In the US, it is plausible that the coalitions around the problem (stage 2B) are not yet strong enough, and so there is potentially more work to be done there. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>We can view the intergovernmental panel on biotechnological risk as an attempt to build a coalition around responses to biotech risk once we had a coalition in place around the problem of biotech risk (moving from stage 2B to stage 3B). \u00a0The problem in this case was that there was not a pre-existing coalition developed around the problem large enough to represent the majority view. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>We investigated using the House of Commons/Lords Select Committee to do response identification, policy identification, and advocacy (stages 3A onwards), however the committees are unable to carry out response and policy identification (stages 3A and 4A) as these are not within the Committees\u2019 mandates. \u00a0Indeed I cannot think of any examples of Government committees that do this form of response and policy research, except perhaps in extreme circumstances such as during times of crisis. We should perhaps view the Commons/Lords Committees as part of moving from a coalition around a specific policy to getting that policy implemented (moving from stage 4B to stage 5). \u00a0We are not yet ready for this stage as policies and coalitions around responses (stages 4A and 3B) have not been adequately developed, let alone coalitions around policies (stage 4B). \u00a0</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"Criticisms\"><span>Criticisms</span></h3>\n<p><span>There are many ways that this model may mislead us, particularly if it is followed in too formulaic a fashion. \u00a0I will list just some of these criticisms below. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>For example, by building visible coalitions we can also ignite opposition, and so need to be wary of the political landscape in order to improve the chances of our activities have an overall positive effect. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>This model could also cause us to miss easy wins, in which the size of the coalition required to cause the policy to be implemented is surprisingly small, if we were focusing attention on earlier stages in the model. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>This model doesn\u2019t properly incorporate the possibility of larger-scale political change (such as a change of party after an election), nor does it account for external events (such as a war or various types of disaster) that can dramatically alter coalitions and the thresholds required for policy implementation. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Additionally, by simply modelling \u2018coalitions\u2019 the model ignores the different roles played by different actors such as the media, the public, interest groups, political elites, and others in the process. \u00a0A more fine grained model of the political landscape and stakeholder engagement will be useful in the later stages of the model. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>So this is a simplistic model, yet it allows us to make hypotheses about where further work may be most useful to help move towards policy solutions to problems. \u00a0These hypotheses can then be probed further using other methods. \u00a0</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"Outcomes_and_next_steps\"><span>Outcomes and next steps</span></h2>\n<p><span>Over the course of our policy engagement to date we have learned much, and also had some significant successes. \u00a0Our report on unprecedented technological risks was widely distributed and read by politicians and civil servants across a number of departments. \u00a0We were also invited to contribute a chapter on existential risk to the UK Government Chief Scientist\u2019s Annual Report on risk. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Going forwards, we have decided to focus more of our effort on building coalitions around the problem and identifying solutions (stages 2B and 3A). \u00a0One of the reasons for this is that we found it easier than expected to gain access to policymakers, and thus when we have more politically feasible responses to problems and more support for them, we think it will be possible for us to take these to policymakers. \u00a0Nonetheless, we will continue to respond to policy opportunities in a more reactive fashion, and will continue to meet with senior policymakers and politicians as opportunities arise. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>This work was carried out by the Global Priorities Project, which is currently fundraising to hire an additional researcher for the project and a full-time project manager who will also lead our outreach to Governments and foundations. \u00a0If you would be interested in contributing to this effort please </span><a href=\"mailto:niel.bowerman@centreforeffectivelaltruism.org\"><span>contact me</span></a><span> or </span><a href=\"mailto:robert.wiblin@centreforeffectivelaltruism.org\"><span>Robert Wiblin</span></a><span>.

believe that\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/90/peters_personal_review_for_julysep_2014/\">I'm pretty productive</a>, and people seem interested in how I do it. \u00a0Previously, I had written\u00a0<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/ifl/how_i_am_productive/\">\"How I Am Productive\"</a>and it became one of\u00a0<a href=\"http://peterhurford.com/blog\">my most popular essays</a>\u00a0of all time.</p>\n<p>The real secret is that, in the past, I wasn't nearly as productive. \u00a0I struggled with procrastination, had issues completing assignments on time, and always felt like I never had enough time to do things. \u00a0But, starting in January 2013 and continuing for the past year and a half, I have slowly implemented several systems and habits in my life that, taken together, have made me productive.</p>\n<p>I've\u00a0<em>learned\u00a0</em>productivity, and I want to try to teach it to others.</p>\n<p>When I wrote\u00a0<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/ifl/how_i_am_productive/\">\"How I Am Productive\"</a>, I kind of brain dumped everything that I knew in one place. \u00a0To do better, I should help people go one step at a time. \u00a0I also focused a lot on particulars of my situation -- to do better, I should be more general. \u00a0The aim of this -- Productivity 101 for Beginners -- is to try to make a general, step-by-step guide to increasing people's productivity.</p>\n<p>...It's basically what I would do if I somehow had to start over.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:\u00a0</strong>This is still advice based on what works for me. \u00a0I've attempted to validate it by trying it on a couple of other people and integrating feedback. \u00a0I've also tried to improve it based on what I've learned in the year between writing this and writing\u00a0<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/ifl/how_i_am_productive/\">\"How I Am Productive\"</a>. \u00a0But your mileage still may vary, and I'm not a professional coach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Step_One__Get_some_goals_\"><strong>Step One: Get some goals!</strong></h2>\n<p>...So here's my step-by-step guide to being productive. \u00a0...Start on step one. \u00a0Focus on step one. \u00a0<em>Do not move on from step one until you're done with step one.</em></p>\n<p>Most people think productivity starts with \"how\", but I always find that it starts with \"why\".</p>\n<p><em>Why do you want to be productive?</em></p>\n<p>...If you could do more, what would you do? \u00a0Would you\u00a0<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/juc/optimal_exercise/\">try to exercise</a>? \u00a0Would you\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/notes-on-the-odin-project/\">practice programming</a>\u00a0regularly? \u00a0Would you\u00a0<a href=\"http://zenhabits.net/write-daily/\">start writing</a>?</p>\n<p><strong>Action point for this step:\u00a0</strong>Carefully pick\u00a0<strong>two</strong>\u00a0goals -- two things that you want to accomplish that you're currently not doing. \u00a0Focus on them and how awesome it would be if you could get those things done!</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid this common mistake:\u00a0</strong>Do not pick more than two goals. \u00a0Only focus on\u00a0<strong>two\u00a0</strong>to start small and simple. \u00a0You can add more goals later.</p>\n<p><strong>You can progress to the next step when\u00a0</strong>you've picked two goals that you're excited about. \u00a0These are the reasons why you want to be productive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Step_Two__Track_Your_Time_\"><strong>Step Two: Track Your Time!</strong></h2>\n<p>So you have your two goals now. \u00a0(If you don't have your two goals, go back to Step One.) \u00a0We now know why you want to be productive.</p>\n<p>Now we have to make some time for your goals. \u00a0But in order to do that, we have to figure out where your time is currently going.</p>\n<p><strong>Action point for this step:\u00a0</strong>Using paper and a pencil, Google Calendar,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.toggl.com\">Toggl</a>, or\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=time+tracker&amp;oq=time+tracker&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0j69i61j0l3.1503j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8\">some other time tracker</a>, map out roughly what you do on a given week. \u00a0If your week is atypical, wait until a more typical week. \u00a0If all your weeks are atypical, just track one and we'll work with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid this common mistake:\u00a0</strong>Don't stress out about timing. \u00a0You can do rough estimates (I started out with fifteen minute intervals, but half hour intervals are fine) and if you miss something, it's ok. \u00a0It might take a day of practice. \u00a0Remember to have your timer with you (carry your notebook, get Toggl's mobile app, etc.) so it's easier to track things.</p>\n<p><strong>You can progress to the next step when\u00a0</strong>you have at least three days of usable timelogs, preferably a week of timelogs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Step_Three__Timebox\"><strong>Step Three: Timebox</strong></h2>\n<p>Now you have to figure out when you want to accomplish your goals. \u00a0Timeboxing refers to making a box of time in your calendar when you'll accomplish something.</p>\n<p><strong>Action point for this step:\u00a0</strong>Look in your timelog to see if you have any time that you're not spending the way you want, and make that the time you do your goals. \u00a0When I started out, I found that I would read the internet aimlessly for two hours a day. \u00a0I cut that down to one hour and then used that free hour to exercise.</p>\n<p>You might find that good times include right when you wake up, right before you go to sleep, after class, before work, after work, etc. \u00a0Lots of different times work for different people -- just find a time that works for you!</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid this common mistake:\u00a0</strong>Don't cut out\u00a0<em>too much\u00a0</em>suboptimal time. \u00a0Breaks are important for rest! \u00a0Maybe you can set a timer (implicitly based on agreeing only to watch one TV episode, or an actual timer that rings), take a break for that amount, and then do what productive thing you want. \u00a0Remember how excited you are about doing it, and how bad you'll feel if you watch that second TV show!</p>\n<p><strong>You can progress to the next step when\u00a0</strong>you have a concrete time in which you will accomplish both your goals.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2 id=\"Step_Four__Commit_\"><strong>Step Four: Commit!</strong></h2>\n<p>We've long recognized that we can't get our goals done ourselves -- weakness of will is just too strong. \u00a0You need the power of a commitment device if you actually want to accomplish your goals in the long-run -- there is no other way.</p>\n<p><strong>Action point for this step:\u00a0</strong>Bind both your goals to some sort of commitment device that works for you. \u00a0Go to the gym with a friend and don't let them let you cancel. \u00a0Sign up for\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.beeminder.com\">Beeminder</a>. \u00a0Sign up for\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.habitrpg.com\">HabitRPG</a>. \u00a0Bet a friend. \u00a0<a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret\">Start making checkmarks for every day on track and don't let yourself break the streak</a>. \u00a0Do more than one of these things. \u00a0Do whatever it takes to get yourself on track!</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid this common mistake:\u00a0</strong>Don't use a commitment device that doesn't work for you. \u00a0If you'd lie to Beeminder, don't use it. \u00a0If you'd lie to a friend you bet, find some way to increase their oversight so that you can't lie. \u00a0You have to make your commitment device inescapable.</p>\n<p><strong>You can progress to the next step when\u00a0</strong>you have a commitment device that has successfully made you stick to your two habits for five days in a row. \u00a0If your commitment device isn't working, get a new one. \u00a0If your time isn't working, choose a new time. \u00a0If you find yourself still failing, maybe your goal isn't important to you? \u00a0Focus on why you want to do this goal, or consider switching goals.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Step_Five__Keep_Going_\"><strong>Step Five: Keep Going!</strong></h2>\n<p>Don't stop now! \u00a0Keep your habit up!</p>\n<p><strong>Action point for this step:\u00a0</strong>Continue to stick to your two goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Avoid this common mistake:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"http://zenhabits.net/small-scale/\">Do not add more goals</a>. \u00a0You must focus on your current two goals in order to make them stick. \u00a0It's worth it in the long run.</p>\n<p><strong>You can progress to the next step when\u00a0</strong>you have stuck to your goal successfully for three weeks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Step_Six__Build_\"><strong>Step Six: Build!</strong></h2>\n<p>Congrats on getting this far. \u00a0Now you're ready to add more goals as you see fit and dig into\u00a0<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/ifl/how_i_am_productive/\">more advanced productivity advice</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zenhabits.net/small-scale/\">Remember to keep things going slow</a>. \u00a0Productivity is a marathon, not a sprint, and the same rules apply. \u00a0Minor setbacks don't matter if the long-run is an improvement.</p>\n<p>You have reached the end of Productivity 101, but I'd be glad to help you further. \u00a0I'd love feedback on how it went for you.</p>\n<p>...I'd also love feedback if one of the steps didn't work for you, so I can improve this guide for you or others.</p></div></div>"},

But one thing I've discovered while doing my own career planning is that the difference between <em>opportunities</em> in a single field seems to matter just as much as the difference between fields. Opportunity-level analysis of job prospects is a great complement to looking at field-level overviews, and I think it can significantly improve career decisions.</p>\n<p>As a case study, consider someone deciding between software engineering and academic mathematics. Looking at the typical person going into these fields, software engineering seems like a much more desirable choice from an EA perspective. As an industry, software pays better, is far less competitive, has more opportunities to do directly impactful work, and grants more career capital for the same level of ability. So you'd probably advise most people to pick software engineering over math academia.</p>\n<p>But looking only at the typical cases throws away a lot of information. The average opportunity for a math degree isn't necessarily the opportunity you're most likely to take. I know a number of academic mathematicians with EA tendencies, and most of them help run <a href=\"http://sparc-camp.org/\">SPARC</a>, a CFAR-funded summer program that introduces mathematically talented high-schoolers to a bunch of ideas that includes many EA-related ones. (For various reasons, it seems to me that SPARC probably wouldn't have succeeded without some academic mathematicians on board.) I think SPARC is an extremely good idea and would be pretty sad if its instructors had all gone into software development instead. In other words, it's not just important what the <em>average</em> opportunity in a field is like, but also the opportunities that <em>you in particular</em> are likely to be able to find.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the quality of which individual opportunities are available in a given field seems to vary wildly, and randomly, from person to person. For instance, when I was looking around for software jobs last year, the job that I took looked easily twice as good as my next-best alternative. Someone with similar skills to me but who wasn't as lucky while looking for software jobs might not have found it--if so, they would probably have found better opportunities in a completely different field. Similarly, a number of my friends applied for academic research positions, and I've repeatedly seen one person find opportunities that seem much better than another person with virtually the same aptitudes.</p>\n<p>All this means that basing your career decision purely on field-level analysis seems likely to miss some potentially great career paths. To sum up, here are some pieces of career choice advice that I think are currently underrated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>When finding a job, it's worth looking very hard for better opportunities.</strong> If there's a large random component to your available opportunities, then simply looking at a <em>larger</em> sample of opportunities is likely to surface <em>better</em> ones. To find my current job, I not only asked all my friends if they knew companies that would be good opportunities--I asked some of their friends and their friends' friends too. It was only at the third degree out that I found the place I ended up working.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>If you're an unusually good fit for a field that isn't big with the EA crowd, look into it anyway.</strong> Even if the average opportunity in a field doesn't look that great, being really awesome at something tends to bring up cool opportunities almost regardless of what the thing is. Just like the mathematicians were able to start SPARC, or like Toby Ord and Will MacAskill have used their academic positions well, there seem to be a lot of benefits to excelling in almost any field.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Skills that expand the set of possible opportunities for you are extra-valuable.</strong> For instance, in college, I might have been better-served by taking fewer super-advanced math classes and more classes that would give me enough grounding in other fields to add some value in them. There's a balance to be struck here--it wouldn't be helpful to be a total dilettante, so it's probably better to branch out to neighboring fields than something different altogether. For instance, as a math and computer science major I probably wouldn't have gotten very much out of taking a couple journalism classes, but I might have tried out robotics, computational biology, or economics.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></div></div>"},
{"date": "23rd Sep 2014", "title": "Cooperation in a movement supporting diverse causes", "author": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt", "num_comments": "15 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>The effective altruism movement has people <a href=\"/ea/4k/four_focus_areas_of_effective_altruism/\">who support many different causes</a>. Some think we can do the most good by alleviating poverty in the developing world; some think it\u2019s best to focus on animal suffering; others again think we should focus on helping future generations; and some argue that the best route to any of these is to invest in the development of the EA movement itself.</p>\n<p>Given that we agree on so many principles, this much disagreement might seem surprising. And it raises a key question: what should we do about it?</p>\n<h2 id=\"Are_some_causes_better_than_others_\">Are some causes better than others?</h2>\n<p>Some differences of opinion over which cause to support may come down to a difference in values. For example, some people think we should give similar weight to the welfare of future generations as we give to our own, and others think we should not.</p>\n<p>But more disagreements arise from differences of opinion about matters of fact. These are often very uncertain matters, such as which of two interventions will most improve the world in the long run. They can also include differences of opinion about how we should weigh proven against speculative interventions, an ultimately empirical but unresolved question.</p>\n<p>Suppose Alice and Bob agree on their values, but Alice thinks the best way to fulfil their values is to try to avoid extinction, whereas Bob thinks it\u2019s better to help people in poverty today. Since they agree on values, there is a correct answer about which cause provides the most value for marginal resources -- and this is unlikely to change with the resources of two people. In this sense some causes are better than others.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t necessarily follow that they should both support the same cause. Some individual choices may come down to the availability of specialist knowledge or opportunities. But it is suggestive. At least some of the difference in opinions about the best cause likely comes down to ignorance, stubbornness, or bias.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Should_we_try_to_persuade_others_to_switch_causes_\">Should we try to persuade others to switch causes?</h2>\n<p>So setting aside value differences and specialisation, one cause is probably best at the margin. For those who believe they support that cause (presumably most people), this seems to present a strong argument for trying to persuade others towards supporting it too. It could provide a substantial increase in the value from their altruistic efforts.</p>\n<p>There is value from the act of trying to persuade others as well as from success. Having a dialogue about the virtues of different options fosters truth-seeking and the idea that we may not be correct in our current views.</p>\n<p>However, there are also reasons not to push too hard to persuade others. The simplest is epistemic modesty. If other smart, well-meaning, and well-informed people are reaching different conclusions from us, we shouldn\u2019t be too confident that we\u2019re the ones who are right.</p>\n<p>Even when do think we\u2019re right, in some circumstances <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/9z/the_epistemic_prisoners_dilemma/\">we can achieve more collectively by cooperating with people with whom we have disagreements of fact</a>. We should preserve good relations with each other. In general, <a href=\"/ea/5p/keeping_the_effective_altruist_movement_welcoming/welcoming/\">it\u2019s worthwhile for effective altruists to be nice</a>. Trying too hard to persuade others risks an acrimonious atmosphere which would be detrimental to the reputation of the whole movement, and its ability to collaborate and grow.</p>\n<p>And while a single cause is probably best at the margin, there\u2019s value for the movement as a whole in supporting a diverse portfolio of causes. Diminishing marginal returns will hardly matter for already-large causes like global health, but could have an effect for smaller ones such as movement growth. By spreading out, we can learn more and learn faster, and are less liable to fall into confirmation bias. By visibly supporting several causes, we also gain a way to enter discussions with people whose prior judgements lean towards some particular causes. It helps to demonstrate our openness to ideas and evidence, where if we all rallied around a single thing early in the growth of the movement we might more easily be pigeon-holed as the people who care about that thing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusions\">Conclusions</h2>\n<p>A better understanding of which causes help most is really useful. So we need to continue to discuss this, sharing insights and information. But cause prioritisation isn\u2019t a competition between the people supporting different causes where there will be winners and losers. Rather it\u2019s a shared endeavour to uncover important truths about the world, where progress means we win collectively.</p>\n<p>So I\u2019ll discuss the merits of different causes with people, and I\u2019ll try gently to persuade them of what seems best to me. But I won\u2019t judge or think poorly of others simply because they don\u2019t share my beliefs. I\u2019ll take suggestions they make seriously, and be just as happy to be persuaded that I\u2019m wrong.</p>\n<address>Acknowledgements: thanks to Ryan Carey, Jess Whittlestone, and Rob Wiblin for comments and suggestions on drafts of this essay.</address></div></div>"},

{"date": "19th Sep 2014", "title": "Lessons from running Harvard Effective Altruism", "author": "Ben_Kuhn", "num_comments": "2 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>During my last two years at Harvard, I co-ran <a href=\"http://harvardea.org/\">Harvard Effective Altruism</a>, bringing it from a membership of one to an organizational board of ten students and scores more who routinely attended our talks. In the hope that some of these tips will help other students start groups of their own, here are some lessons I learned.</p>\n<p>A couple caveats apply to these notes. First, my sample size is small\u2014I only ran one group! Second, my lessons might not generalize: HEA probably faced a different set of problems at Harvard than we would have at other schools, and I faced different personal problems than someone with a different skillset might have. So interpret these notes with caution.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Notes:</strong> Cross-posted from\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/studentgroup\">benkuhn.net</a>. Thanks to Ryan Carey for combining the articles and cleaning the HTML.</em></p>\n<p><em>Looking to start an EA student group? Please\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/contact/\">get in touch</a>\u00a0if you\u2019d like! Starting a student group is a great way to improve the world and you\u2019ll learn a lot doing it. I\u2019m always happy to help new student groups in whatever way I can.</em></p>\n<h1 id=\"Have_two_people\">Have two people</h1>\n<p>Far and away the most important factor in HEA\u2019s success is that we had two co-presidents.</p>\n<p>At first, it was just me running things, and my motivation and excitement about my plans came in bursts. I would get a new idea for a project or event and start organizing it in a flurry of energy\u2014but soon problems would come up, I\u2019d start to think it was doomed to failure and get demoralized, and everything I\u2019d set in motion would grind to a halt. Obviously this was self-defeating and not very helpful for our club\u2019s operations.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, towards the end of the first year, <a href=\"http://jasturm.blogspot.com/\">John Sturm</a> took the initiative and got involved with organizing events as well. With John to take care of half the organizational burden (and frequently more) and plug away even when I was demoralized, I felt much less overwhelmed about running things. This broke down my aversion that running more events would start another boom-bust motivation cycle for me, and allowed us to do way more things than we could have with just me.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re more resilient to setbacks and more of a natural leader than I am, it may be less important for you to have a co-organizer. But given that finding a second person is also one of the most popular pieces of startup advice, it seems like it applies to most people, even if they\u2019re as resilient and leader-y as most startup founders. So I\u2019d recommend making it a high priority to find a co-organizer.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s hard, of course, because a co-organizer needs to have a lot of initiative and agency\u2014they have to care about the project even when you don\u2019t. On the other hand, if you can\u2019t find any good co-organizers before you start your group, don\u2019t worry too much\u2014I didn\u2019t know John before I started HEA, and only met him when he joined the group and came to some of our events. So you can probably recruit a co-organizer from your membership; just keep your eyes peeled for good ones, because it\u2019s a <em>huge</em> boost in organizational capacity.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Don_t_be_embarrassed\">Don't be embarrassed</h1>\n<p>The first time Harvard Effective Altruism did any sort of publicity was at Harvard\u2019s \u201cstudent activities fair,\u201d where literally every student group at Harvard lined up at rows of tables, and masochistic students ran the gauntlet in a doomed quest to find meaning in undergraduate life.</p>\n<p>We were running a <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/givinggames.aspx\">Giving Game</a> in which we presented people with three charities and asked them to choose one to receive a dollar.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how a typical HEA pitch went:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(student walks past)</p>\n<p>(another student walks past)</p>\n<p>(third student walks past)</p>\n<p>(fourth student walks past, awkwardly glances towards the HEA poster)</p>\n<p>Ben: Hi?</p>\n<p>Student: Um, hi, what is Harvard Effective Altruism?</p>\n<p>Ben: <em>(sheepishly)</em> Okay, so I know this sounds cheesy, but we actually try to figure out the best ways to improve the world and then do those things.</p>\n<p>Student: Huh?</p>\n<p>Ben: Like it turns out some charities are WAY better than others! Want to play this Giving Game?</p>\n<p>(bemused student makes excuses and leaves)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After three hours of such pitches we had a grand total of one person who came back for more than one meeting.</p>\n<p>The reason our publicity was so disastrously bad is that I was bad at talking to people, for a couple of reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> I realized that the idea of HEA seemed crazy: \u201cjoin us and we\u2019ll try to figure out how to maximize the good we do in the world!\u201d\u2014it combined the tired cliche of trying to save the world with the taboo of declaring that some ways of saving it were better than others. But my mistake was <em>letting other people know</em> that I knew HEA seemed crazy. As soon as they realized that I myself felt goofy, it was game over for convincing them to get involved. </li>\n<li> Because I felt like I was pushing a crazy idea, I was also worried about wasting people\u2019s time. This was just silly. If the students didn\u2019t want their time wasted, they shouldn\u2019t have tried to run the activities-fair gauntlet. And anyway, they were perfectly capable of extracting themselves from the pitch if they wanted to. We should have been less polite. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>By contrast, here\u2019s a similar pitch from when we were advertising in a dining hall this year:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(student walks past)</p>\n<p>(Ben walks up to them, holds out a dollar bill)</p>\n<p>(student automatically takes dollar bill)</p>\n<p>Ben: Do you want to donate this dollar to charity?</p>\n<p>Student: Huh?</p>\n<p>B: Like, we have a list of charities, and you can pick one to give this dollar to.</p>\n<p>S: Oh, okay, I guess.</p>\n<p>B: Awesome! It\u2019s actually not literally that dollar, it\u2019s this computer form. Can you read through these three blurbs and select whichever one you think will do the most good with your dollar?</p>\n<p>S: Sure.</p>\n<p>(S reads through blurbs)</p>\n<p>S: So what\u2019s the deal with this?</p>\n<p>B: I\u2019m glad you asked! So, like, you want to improve the world, right? <em>(S: Yeah.)</em> And you prefer improving it <em>more</em> if you can, right? <em>(S: Yeah.)</em> So we try to figure out how to improve it the most. It\u2019s weird how nobody else is doing that, huh?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By this time, I had gotten over my feeling of goofiness, and just powered through. I often acknowledged that HEA was <em>uncommon</em>, but not that it was <em>weird</em>. Plus, I was more aggressive about initially engaging with students\u2014they had come to be marketed at, after all. I still didn\u2019t give people a hard sell if they didn\u2019t seem interested, but I was okay with being pushy to get their attention away from all the other pushy people. As a result, students were way more interested and engaged.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Getting_good_speakers\">Getting good speakers</h1>\n<p>If there\u2019s one thing that I\u2019m proud of about my tenure running HEA, it\u2019s our programming. Last year we had over 10 speakers come to give talks to HEA, including Peter Singer, Jaan Tallinn, and <a href=\"http://harvardea.org/events/#past\">many other extremely popular and busy people</a>. We also raised thousands of dollars to cover honoraria from these speakers. How?</p>\n<p>The trick is to be well-connected like me and John so that you know a diverse pool of famous people and deep-pocketed university organizations to lean on for favors. If you don\u2019t have such a pool already, get out there and network!</p>\n<p>\u2026just kidding. I didn\u2019t actually know most of our speakers before I invited them to speak. I just sent them a cold email asking if they wanted to give a talk for HEA (sometimes with an introduction from a friend or our excellent faculty adviser, <a href=\"http://medethics.med.harvard.edu/people/eyal/\">Nir</a>). We got a lot of silence\u2014my archives are littered with the corpses of unanswered invitations\u2014but we also got a lot of responses, and our awesome lineup of speakers was definitely worth the additional messages cast into the void.</p>\n<p>I also have an important sub-tip here. For emailing potential speakers\u2014and also for life in general\u2014I found <a href=\"http://www.boomeranggmail.com/\">Boomerang</a> to be <em>totally indispensable</em>. I set any sent emails to return to my inbox in a week if the recipient didn\u2019t respond, and often if I sent them a second follow-up email I\u2019d get a response after that. In fact, Boomerang is practically a requirement to communicate with some professors, who I suspect just have a policy of never responding to email the first time it\u2019s sent\u2026 Again\u2014if you rely on email to make important things happen and you don\u2019t have Boomerang, start using Boomerang NOW.</p>\n<p>Psychologically, I often found it demoralizing to send cold emails, since each one individually had a fairly low chance of turning into a talk further down the road\u2014it often felt like most of my work was wasted (although our response rate was a lot higher than I thought it would be). I tried to fight this by <em>valuing effort instead of results</em>\u2014I would phrase my goals in terms of \u201chigh-quality emails sent\u201d instead of \u201cresponses received\u201d or \u201ctalks scheduled.\u201d</p>\n<p>Overall, something like 20% of people we cold-emailed ended up giving a talk at HEA. I can\u2019t promise that this will translate to student groups at other schools\u2014we certainly benefited from the Harvard brand\u2014but even if we had gotten a much lower response rate, we could have sent more emails or started asking less-busy people. The credibility and attention that we got from having such a great lineup was a huge boost when we were recruiting new members, so I\u2019m really glad we did it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Navigating_Bureaucracy\">Navigating Bureaucracy</h1>\n<p>Running a student group entails doing a lot of paperwork and getting through a lot of red tape. Especially at first, I had a hard time keeping track of everything, and frequently left things until the last minute (or later) when e.g. reserving space for events.</p>\n<p>After spending one too many afternoons on tenterhooks waiting for the room reservation office to email me back, I finally cracked under the stress. For once I had actually paid attention to the booking deadlines and reserved our room a week in advance\u2014but they still hadn\u2019t confirmed two days beforehand. Come hell or high water, I decided, I was going to get my room reserved <em>today</em>. I put on my best starving-frantic-student-in-need face, thought up my best excuses, and marched over to the Science Center to demand satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Instead of the hard-nosed, battle-ready bureaucrat I\u2019d been imagining, I was greeted by a very pleasant gentleman named Ron. Ron had gotten some files out of order and then been swamped by requests, because it was the beginning of the semester and all the student groups wanted space. He hadn\u2019t realized we\u2019d been waiting so long, and was happy I\u2019d stopped by to ask about it\u2014especially since we had to have some back-and-forth about the logistics, which went much faster in person than over email.</p>\n<p>As a software developer, I\u2019ve been trained to think that if Harvard specifies an interface for students to communicate with institutions, that interface is a Holy Abstraction Barrier That Shall Not Be Crossed. But it turns out that bureaucratic abstractions <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html\">leak</a> <em>even more</em> than computational ones\u2014the specified interfaces don\u2019t really work very well. Combine that with the depersonalizing medium of email, where everyone is tempted to be rude or stop replying, and you have a recipe for unpleasant experiences.</p>\n<p>I had the same experience again and again\u2014room booking, financial forms, advertising space, and practically everything else we did went much more smoothly if we <em>showed up in person</em>when we got confused or had something complicated to do. I still try to avoid it when possible\u2014it takes up people\u2019s time and would probably get annoying if we did it excessively, and having to resolve issues in person is a red flag that we\u2019re getting some other part of the process wrong. But if bureaucracy starts to drag on, showing up in person is an almost sure-fire way to speed things along.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Outside_Support\">Outside Support</h1>\n<p>One easy way that HEA achieved suprising or impressive-seeming things is that we <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/good-speakers\">reached out to lots of speakers</a>. A second is that we had a <em>ton</em> of support from folks who weren\u2019t in our \u201ccore audience\u201d of Harvard students. Both Harvard faculty and other EA-minded people gave us huge amounts of information, technical assistance, introductions, and even offers of funding if we needed it.</p>\n<p>An incomplete list of things that we\u2019ve needed non-student help for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Our amazing faculty adviser <a href=\"http://medethics.med.harvard.edu/people/eyal/\">Nir</a> gave us a lot of suggestions and introductions to speakers, checked in periodically when we were having organizational problems, gave us advice on hosting speakers, and was generally all-around ridiculously helpful.</p>\n<p>HEA was actually required to have a faculty adviser per Harvard\u2019s regulations, but I highly recommend having one even if your school doesn\u2019t require you to\u2014you can invite a sympathetic professor to be your official adviser and then meet with them, ask them advice by email, or whatever works for you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other Harvard faculty mentioned our activities in their classes, advertised our speakers, donated to our fundraiser, or had discussions over dinner with our members. These were all immensely helpful. In retrospect I wish we had tried to interact with more faculty, and more closely, than we did\u2014I think many of them would have been happy to help even more.</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t know where to look for faculty, try the professors of philosophy (especially ethics), economics (especially development), public health (especially medical ethics), and psychology (especially moral psychology). Also try <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/contact/\">emailing me</a>, as I may be able to connect you with other folks nearby.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://jefftk.com/\">Jeff</a> and <a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/\">Julia</a> usually give the first talk of every semester, introducing new members to the ideas of effective altruism. Since they\u2019re more relatable to college students than HEA\u2019s typical speakers are (many of whom are professors or nonprofit executives), they\u2019re great at providing a friendly and welcoming introduction to effective altruism.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An (anonymous) local effective altruist sponsored a matching challenge for our first winter fundraiser, which made it much more credible and much more motivating for people to donate. This made the fundraiser way more exciting both to the students running it and to the folks who donated.</p>\n<p>Another supporter offered us a substantial amount of money in back-up funds if the Harvard grants that we were applying for didn\u2019t come through. Although we didn\u2019t end up needing the funds last year, it was very helpful to be able to promise speakers with certainty that we\u2019d be able to reimburse their travel and lodging expenses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other folks from the local Boston EA group came to our talks, advertised them to their friends, donated to our fundraiser, let us know when interesting speakers were passing through Boston, and generally provided a ton of miscellaneous advice and help.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I can\u2019t speak for other kinds of student groups, but if you\u2019re starting an effective altruism student group in particular, finding people who are willing to help is pretty easy\u2014just post in the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/?ref=br_tf\">Facebook group</a> or <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/contact/\">email me</a> and I\u2019ll put you in touch with folks who can help!</p>\n<h1 id=\"Lessons_From_the_Philanthropy_Fellowship\">Lessons From the Philanthropy Fellowship</h1>\n<p>The event we ran that really got our membership going was what we called the \u201cphilanthropy fellowship.\u201d Although the content was specific to HEA\u2019s mission, I think the idea and lessons generalize to any kind of student group. Here\u2019s how the philanthropy fellowship worked:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/TODO\">cold-emailed a bunch of awesome people</a> asking them to give talks for Harvard Effective Altruism\u2019s philanthropy fellowship.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We also got <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/support\">an anonymous donor</a> to promise to match any funds our philanthropy fellowship raised for the term.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At all of our events at the beginning of the year, we told everyone that we were running a \u201cphilanthropy fellowship\u201d program in which fellows would apply and be accepted to attend a series of talks and dinners with our awesome speakers, and run a fundraiser at the end. At this point I believe our list of promised speakers included Peter Singer and Jaan Tallinn, so this generated a fair amount of interest.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We put up <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/TODO\">an application</a> with some basic questions, gave it a deadline, and publicized it to a ton of mailing lists (both ones for which it was on-topic, and dorm-wide mailing lists where it was permissible to hawk random clubs/activities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After the deadline, we called back all the applicants we thought were a good fit for a short one-on-one interview with one of the HEA organizers, where we asked them a couple questions (mostly to get to know them) and gave a little spiel about how the fellowship would go (schedule, expectations for attendance, the fundraiser at the end, etc.).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We weren\u2019t very selective at all with the application\u2014we mainly used it to screen out people who were obviously there just to promote their own charities, and I think we invited everyone who interviewed to do the fellowship.</p>\n<p>But it still ended up creating a core group of people who came to nearly all of our events and engaged with HEA a lot. I\u2019m not sure about all the factors that led to the success of the philanthropy fellowship, but I have a couple theories. (Note that these are <em>only theories</em>, i.e., not empirically verified\u2014so generalize at your own risk!)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>There was a big incentive for joining the fellowship. Although our speakers\u2019 talks were open to the public, the dinners with them were restricted to members of the philanthropy fellowship. We advertised this fact heavily and I\u2019m sure the prospect of dinner with Peter Singer got at least one person to join.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scarcity creates value. If people perceive your group as hard to get into\u2014even if it isn\u2019t\u2014then they\u2019ll value their membership in it more, and get more excited about your events. This is why we had an application process, even though it was more work for us and we only rejected a couple people.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We asked for an explicit commitment to attend events first. A problem for a lot of groups is that students are really interested at the beginning of the semester, but as classwork piles on they start to feel swamped and stop going to as many events. Since we asked students to commit to attending the entire fellowship at the beginning of the semester, they tended to make it a higher priority.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, there are plenty of other lessons we learned from the fellowship as well\u2014mainly about how we could have run it better.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Advertising_Strategies\">Advertising Strategies</h1>\n<p>HEA tried a lot of different ways of getting people\u2019s attention. Here are some of our workhorses\u2014strategies that we use frequently and generally work well:</p>\n<h2 id=\"Giving_Games\">Giving Games</h2>\n<p><em>(Note: somewhat EA-specific, though the general spirit applies to other types of groups.)</em></p>\n<p>One thing almost all student groups do a lot of is tabling. We\u2019ve found that interactive activities work pretty well\u2014we often run <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/get-involved/giving-game-2\">Giving Games</a> where we put up $1 for each participant and they decide to donate it to one of a list of charities we provide, based on which one they think will be the most effective.</p>\n<p>Giving Games are cool in that they\u2019re very easy to study scientifically\u2014if you display peoples\u2019 charity choices on a computer, you can very easily randomize what text and what options people see. You can then measure how many people give you their emails at the end of the Giving Game, as a proxy for how engaging they found the game. HEA did <a href=\"http://harvardea.org/news/2014/06/13/research/\">some of this research</a>at the end of last semester and found some interesting results.</p>\n<p>First, including more speculative charities may decrease people\u2019s engagement. HEA tested a group of three global poverty charities against a group of one global poverty charity, one \u201cmeta\u201d charity, and one charity working on existential risks, and found that people offered the latter choice were significantly less likely to put down their emails.</p>\n<p>Also, the data suggested (weakly, not-quite-significantly) that including information about how effective charities were <em>decreased</em> people\u2019s engagement in the game. This might be a real effect, but it\u2019s possible it was due to confounding because the descriptions containing effectiveness info were longer, and people got bored. Or it\u2019s possible that it\u2019s a mere statistical fluctuation. More research is needed to find out, but either way, it\u2019s a good reminder to keep Giving Games short and sweet.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re running an EA group and want to run one, there\u2019s more information at the link above. You can also get in touch with The Life You Can Save and they may be willing to fund your Giving Game.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Giant_eye_catching_posters\">Giant eye-catching posters</h2>\n<p>And I do mean giant. Harvard has a set of four sandwich boards at the gate between Harvard Yard and the Science Center, which can be reserved one face at a time. Most student organizations take their normal event posters and tile the entire face of the sandwich board with about 20 of these. For our first talk of the semester, we instead decided to blow up our poster of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Temkin\">Larry Temkin</a>\u2018s face by a factor of 20. A surprising number of folks at the event told us that the poster was how they found out about it, and I think a lot of this was that it was more eye-catching than the typical student-group poster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Professors\">Professors</h2>\n<p>Often if you\u2019re holding an academic-ish event, professors in related fields will happily promote it in their classes. HEA has had success asking professors in philosophy, economics, and public health to advertise various of our events. Professors also make <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/support\">great allies in general</a>, and asking them to introduce your event in class can be a great icebreaker.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Personal_appeals\">Personal appeals</h2>\n<p>Asking your friends to go to your events isn\u2019t particularly scalable. But for more targeted things like applying to the <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/fellowship\">philanthropy fellowship</a>, we\u2019ve had good success with individually asking friends if they\u2019d be interested in applying. Of course, you should only do this with friends that you <em>actually</em> think would be interested, since it\u2019s rude to pester your friends, and if they end up not enjoying the event they might get annoyed. But</p>\n<h2 id=\"Mass_communications\">Mass communications</h2>\n<p>HEA has a mailing list of a few hundred students, and we also sent out emails to a number of general-interest mailing lists (e.g. dorm-specific mailing lists).</p>\n<p>It looks a bit nicer to send emails to each list individually, and include a little bit of list-specific content in the email. But that\u2019s annoying, because it means you have to cut-and-paste your email to a bunch of different lists. To speed up that process, you can <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5508283/how-to-set-up-a-mail-merge-in-gmail-for-personalized-mass-emails\">set up a mail merge in Gmail</a> and send a batch of emails with customizations from a spreadsheet.</p>\n<p>We also used mail-merges sometimes when emailing applicants for the philanthropy fellowship, and it\u2019s possible that you could use it for cold-emailing professors as well (although we haven\u2019t tried it, and it takes some care to make the writing good enough and specific enough that the generic parts don\u2019t sound bad).</p>\n<p>The benefits of mail merge come not only from speeding up the batch emails that you were going to send anyway, but causing you to send much more email because it\u2019s easier. Email can be quite effective at drumming up interest for talks and fellowships, so this is a pretty big boost.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Facebook_event_invitations\">Facebook event invitations</h2>\n<p>We created Facebook events for all of our talks and mass-invited our classmates to these. In addition to letting people know about the events, but it also helped us gauge attendance and distribute messages (e.g. updates about the event location or links to slides) to everyone who wanted to attend. We included event RSVP links in all of our emails to lists as well, to contribute as much as possible to having one centralized place where everyone going to the event could get info.</p>\n<p>Mass-inviting all your relevant Facebook friends to every event is a huge slog, of course, because if you don\u2019t want to spam people you have to manually curate the list of people you invite, which means looking through your entire friend list and making a decision for each friend for each event. Fortunately, there\u2019s a much easier way, which takes advantage of the fact that if you make a \u201cfriend list\u201d on Facebook, their algorithms will automatically suggest that you add other similar friends to it. Here\u2019s how it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> First, create a Friend List and add maybe 50 or so classmates on it that you want to invite to your group\u2019s events. Then go to the list and look at the friend suggestions\u2014Facebook will suggest that you add the rest of your classmates. Add whomever you want (I suggest all of them, since invite spam is normal, but if you want to curate the list more heavily, Facebook will get smarter about who it suggests to be on the list). </li>\n<li> Now add a bookmark in your browser to the following link: <code> javascript:elms=document.getElementsByName(\"checkableitems[]\");for (i=0;i&lt;elms.length;i++){if (elms[i].type=\"checkbox\")elms[i].click()}; </code> </li>\n<li> Now when you want to mass-invite these people to an event, go to the event page and click \u201cInvite Friends\u201d. Click the dropdown that says \u201cSearch by Name\u201d and select the list that you made in step 1. You should now see all the people on the list show up below. </li>\n<li> Scroll all the way down that list (this is important\u2014the later checkboxes won\u2019t appear until you scroll down, so you won\u2019t end up inviting everybody otherwise). </li>\n<li> Click the bookmark you made in step 2. Everyone should be checked off and you can invite them! </li>\n<li> Facebook limits the number of people you can invite in one swoop, so to double-check that you invited everyone, repeat steps 3-4 and verify that all the checkboxes are greyed-out (this means the friend has already been invited). If not, repeat steps 3-5 as necessary. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is way faster than manually checking a bunch of boxes\u2014about 30 seconds instead of 5-10 minutes for me. It also means that we can reliably get all the organizers to invite their friends, which means our Facebook events have a much broader reach.</p></div></div>"},

Who\u2019d have thought \u201cdoing the most good\u201d boiled down to handing out cash to poor Kenyan farmers?</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>When people see effective altruists focused on cash transfers, distributing bed-nets and cheap medicine - and claiming they\u2019re doing the most good - there\u2019s a common reaction:</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>This looks naive and narrow : Sure these interventions help the immediate beneficiaries, but they hardly look like they\u2019re solving the world\u2019s greatest problems. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>It looks like they\u2019ve made the mistakes of ignoring small probabilities of big upsides, focusing only on concrete outcomes, and ignored the historical record (in which science, technology and better government are some of the main drivers of progress). It also looks like they\u2019ve completely discounted common-sense do-gooding, which is not mainly focused on global health.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Now suppose you care about both the welfare of people today *and* helping people in the future. If you care about the future, you\u2019ll want to make investments in technology and economic growth that will pay off later. You\u2019ll also want to make sure society is in a position to navigate unpredictable future challenges. This will mean better global institutions, smarter leaders, more social science, and so on. And it\u2019s hard to know which of these are most pressing.1</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Overall, this menu of global priorities looks much closer to common-sense efforts to make a difference. In this way, long-run focused effective altruism ends up looking more common-sense than efforts just focused on helping present generations.2</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Long-run focused effective altruism is often seen as even less common-sense than the short-run focused version. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Long-run focused effective altruism only becomes unintuitive when taken to an extreme and combined with further non-common-sense beliefs, such as the belief that reducing existential risk is the best way to aid the future, and within that, the belief that artificial intelligence is the most pressing existential risk.3 </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Because long-run focused effective altruism is associated with these further weird positions, it\u2019s often downplayed when speaking to new people, in favor of short-run effective altruism (malaria nets and so on). I propose that it will be better, especially for people who are already engaged with making a difference, to introduce them first to *moderate long-run focused effective altruism* rather than the short-run focused version. It\u2019s more intuitive and reasonable sounding.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>The reason this doesn\u2019t happen already, I think, is that people aren\u2019t sure how to explain moderate long-run focused effective altruism - it\u2019s much easier to say \u201cmalaria nets\u201d and direct someone to (traditional) GiveWell. But in the last year it has become much easier to explain. When it comes to picking causes, emphasise that effective altruists take a strategic approach. Yes, they consider their personal passions, but they also try to work on causes that are important, tractable and neglected. Explain that the most important causes are the ones that do the most to build a flourishing society now and in the long-run. Then give several examples: yes there\u2019s global health (especially good on tractability), but there\u2019s also global catastrophic risks (good on importance and neglectedness); scientific research, penal reform, and much else. Link them the Open Philanthropy Project, 80,000 Hours and the Copenhagen Consensus.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>In conclusion, short-run effective altruism is often favored as more intuitive and better for introducing to new people compared to long-run focused effective altruism, because long-run focused effective altruism is often associated with further weird positions. However, a more moderate and uncertain long-run focused effective altruism is actually the most reasonable sounding position.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>* * *</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>1 Of course, interventions which maximise short-run welfare might *also* happen to be the best-way to help the long-run future, but that\u2019s a topic for a different day.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>2 It also looks more common-sense because it involves less certainty. It\u2019s very hard to know what the long-run effects of our actions are, so long-run focused effective altruism tends to work with a broader range of causes than the short-run focused version.</span></p>\n<p><br><span>3. In fact, even if you believe both of these things, once the low-hanging fruit with friendly AI research etc. are used up, you\u2019re going to then focus on common-sense causes like international collaboration.</span></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "3rd Oct 2014", "title": "Introducing an EA Donation Registry", "author": "Tom_Ash", "num_comments": "13 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>One of the most important messages of effective altruism is that you can do a phenomenal amount of good through well-chosen donations. As a community, EAs also further this goal by publicly establishing a norm of giving to effective charities, making their own commitments to do so and encouraging others. With this in mind, we\u2019ve created an <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/donations\">EA Donation Registry</a> through which people can share plans to donate (of any form, and to any cause), as well as record past donations that they\u2019ve made.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve donated to effective charities in the past or have plans to do so, then we\u2019d encourage you to <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/donations/add\">sign up</a>. (Or if you already described your past or planned donations in the <a href=\"http://survey.effectivealtruismhub.com\">2014 EA Survey</a>, you can simply <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/survey/sharing-your-survey-answers-your-ea-profile\">convert these to a registry entry</a> instead.) Peter Hurford\u2019s post <a href=\"/ea/7q/to_inspire_people_to_give_be_public_about_your/\">To Inspire People to Give, Be Public About Your Giving</a> succinctly describes some of the familiar reasons for doing so - it shows that giving large amounts to effective charities is something that people actually do, providing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof\">social proof</a> and normalising and encouraging this, particularly among peer groups. We also hope that it can serve as a gentle prompt to action and commitment device, although understanding that plans change we\u2019ve given donors the ability to edit them at any time - it'd be both expected and understood that many will do so. This a registry of plans, not necessarily pledges.</p>\n<p>You can already see hundreds of EAs\u2019 past and planned donations on the registry. There\u2019s some inspiring material there, from the over $40 million that <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/jim-greenbaum\">Jim Greenbaum</a> has given over his lifetime, to the many people aiming to donate substantial portions of their income, such as <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/peter-singer\">Peter Singer</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We created this registry partly in response to requests for a cause neutral venue for donation plans. For example, you can use it to see people donating to <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/donations/plans/animal-welfare\">animal charities</a> or <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/donations/plans/existential-risk\">existential risk alleviation</a>. People concerned with animal welfare are pointed to it by Animal Charity Evaluators, taking the place of this functionality in the old Effective Animal Activism website; people reporting their donations to ACE are given the option of making them public on the registry at the same time. For people concerned with global poverty, we think that the Giving What We Can and Life You Can Save pledges are fantastic devices, with a clear message about the compelling case about giving money to those who need it most. We point people to <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge\">the GWWC pledge</a> in the hope that they can take or build up to it, while also letting them share plans of any size on the registry.</p>\n<p>The registry is an open, community-owned project coordinated through .impact, so we\u2019d love to hear of any uses that you might make of it, and you can also send us suggestions or feedback via our <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/contact\">contact form</a>. But most of all, we\u2019d encourage you to share your past and planned donations on it for the reasons above. You can register plans of any form and size via a free text field, so take a moment to consider if there are any that you\u2019d like to share - and if you\u2019ve yet to think about where you might donate, we hope that this will provide a great opportunity to do so!\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>See also:\u00a0<a href=\"http://bit.ly/introducing-ea-profiles-eaf\">Introducing EA Profiles</a></em></p></div></div>"},

", "author": "Julia_Wise", "num_comments": "22 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span>Periodically people talk about the pros and cons of different lifestyles for EA types, including whether to have children. I wrote up a post, originally <a href=\"http://thewholesky.wordpress.com/2014/12/23/how-much-does-it-cost-to-have-a-baby/\">here</a>, on what it has cost my family this year. I also wrote up a post on other aspects of our <a href=\"https://thewholesky.wordpress.com/2014/12/27/what-was-it-like-to-have-a-baby/\">experience</a>\u00a0this year. hope this may be useful to people deciding whether or when to have children.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<hr>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Short answer: about $20,000 for the first year.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thewholesky.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/baby-cost-with-food.png\"><span><img src=\"https://thewholesky.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/baby-cost-with-food.png?w=640\" alt=\"baby cost with food\"></span></a></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://thewholesky.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/baby-cost-with-food.png\"></a>I just did the math on how much greater our expenses were in 2014 than we would have expected if we had not had a baby in March. I did it based on the calendar year because many of the expenses (medical visits, pre-birth purchases) started before the birth. This is all based on living in Boston, Massachusetts and trying to be fairly frugal but not painfully so.</span></p>\n<p><span>Childcare:\u00a0We only used a couple of weeks of daycare at $350/week. We\u2019ve since switched to a system in which Jeff works full time and I work part time, and Lily is never in daycare. Our social life consists mostly of things we can bring her to, so we haven\u2019t really needed babysitters at night.</span></p>\n<p><span>Clothes: we get most clothes from thrift stores or the local children\u2019s resale shop, where they cost about $4/item. We did get hand-me-downs as well,\u00a0so it would have been more without those.</span></p>\n<p><span>Gear: includes bottlefeeding stuff, cloth diapers, toys, a crib, a rug, and a series of glider chairs. In our area, it's easy to find many of these things used on Craigslist. Includes $100 for extra loads of laundry done. We got a carseat as a hand-me-down, but I added $100 to the tally in case you needed to get one. We spent $200 in airline fees to take Lily with us on vacation. Breast pumps are now\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/breast-feeding-benefits/\">covered by insurance</a>\u00a0in the US, but bottles and other parts are not.</span></p>\n<p><span>Medical/hygiene: copays and miscellaneous purchases at the drug store. We paid more for better medical insurance this year, plus more copays for more medical visits. Most of our insurance premiums are covered by Jeff\u2019s work, so if he worked for a less generous company we would have paid more.</span></p>\n<p><span>Lost wages: I got no paid maternity leave from my job, though I did save up about two weeks of vacation days.\u00a0I quit my job for five months, then went back part-time. Jeff used 8 weeks of paid parental leave to care for Lily while I was working.\u00a0My schedule currently dovetails with Jeff\u2019s: he works full-time starting at around 7 am, and I work evenings and Saturday mornings. If we had less flexible work schedules, or if he had not gotten the two months of paid leave, our costs would be higher.</span></p>\n<p><span>Housing is conspicuously absent on this chart. We did not change our housing this year, though we did start the process of buying a house. Lily slept in our bedroom. This got hairy at times, and we\u2019re looking forward to having a separate room for her. The delay in moving was more about looking for the right house than about trying to save money.</span></p>\n<p><span>Food: I ate an extra 500 calories daily while pregnant or breastfeeding. This cost about $500 extra in groceries. Lily\u2019s also eating some solids now, but she mostly eats yogurt and bits of what we\u2019re eating.</span></p>\n<p><span>We did not pay more for transportation because we did not buy a car. Living with family and being able to use their car sometimes was helpful.</span></p>\n<p><span>Not included: tax breaks. We expect around $350 in the child tax credit (maximum is $1000 if you earn less than we do). We also expect lower taxes in general because of having a dependent. We don\u2019t know how much this will end up saving us; I\u2019ll update after we do our taxes.</span></p>\n<p><span>Also not included: costs to our careers. Jeff taking the full paternity leave provided by his work probably hurt his job slightly, though not like it would in a more cut-throat business.

To those who are, it can seem like an obvious, logical course of action. After all, it only relies on a desire to help people and to get more value for your money. There are a lot of potential supporters of effective altruism out there! Still, relatively few of them are actual supporters. I want to talk about why this gap exists and what we can do about it.</p>\n<p>First, is the gap a bad thing? I think it is, even if we only focus on the perspective of the potential effective altruist. If you want to do something, knowing how to do it is valuable to you. So for people who really want to help others, informing them is a useful service. Not knowing, and even not knowing that there's something to know, is a problem for them. And the more people who support these ideas, the more they will collectively be able to achieve.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 id=\"To_spread_the_movement__it_must_be_appealing\">To spread the movement, it must be appealing</h2>\n<p>Why isn't everyone who really cares, and is willing to act on reasonable arguments, already an effective altruist? It can seem a pretty obvious idea: to maximise what you can achieve you should measure and evaluate the options and act accordingly. Even ten years ago there were far fewer people acting efficiently on these beliefs, but the numbers have been growing quickly. To get to this stage it isn\u2019t enough to have a desire to help and common sense. The answer must be that it is one of those ideas which seems obvious only in retrospect. You also need to be exposed to the concepts, and to approach them with an open mind.</p>\n<p>So if we want these ideas to spread, we need to make them widely available and accessible. By accessible I mean that they should be easy-to-understand, appealing, and non-confrontational. Confrontation frequently closes people's minds against new ideas. Similarly, if the ideas initially appear odd or distasteful it can stop people ever taking them seriously.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 id=\"Don_t_make_arguments_that_sound_too_weird\">Don\u2019t make arguments that sound too weird</h2>\n<p>For people who have internalised the central concepts of effective altruism, there is often a tension here. It turns out that these first, in-retrospect-obvious, ideas are just a small part of larger and more general theories which are being developed. The new ideas are often important and intellectually exciting, and it is natural to want to share them widely.</p>\n<p>This can often be a mistake. Even very natural ideas are often built on the paradigm of effective altruism. Without the context of this paradigm they may seem strange or ill-founded. This can be a disservice to the ideas, to effective altruism, and to the people hearing them. These people might very reasonably dismiss the ideas, and attach negative connotations to them. In turn this could stop them from ever seriously considering the central ideas of effective altruism, even if with proper consideration they would have loved these ideas.</p>\n<p>For example, after internalising the idea that we should be seeking to help people as much as we can, people often notice we may have opportunities now to help people in the future. If the future has a decent chance of being long and prosperous, perhaps most people are yet to come. And if we have opportunities to increase that chance of being long and prosperous -- for example by reducing the risk of human extinction -- it\u2019s plausible these opportunities are the best use of our resources. As presented here this argument runs a little fast, passing over key questions such as how we could ever expect to be able to reduce this, and it is unclear that it would convince anyone who hadn\u2019t already thought about charity as an activity that could be optimised.</p>\n<p>Far worse is to present the conclusion without the argument. You might say something like \u201cThe most important thing we can do is to stop humanity going extinct,\u201d (when most people have never seriously thought about scenarios where this happens), or \u201cCompared to the far future, people alive today hardly matter.\u201d The danger here is not just of seeming wrong, but of seeming like a crackpot, even to a smart and well-informed audience. With enough time they might try to understand why you\u2019d believe this obviously wrong thing, and perhaps realise you could be right. But with a limited amount of attention they\u2019re likely instead to use the good rule of thumb of not paying attention to crazy ideas. Even questions, like \u201cHow can we best reduce the chance of extinction?\u201d, can sound similarly weird because of their implicit assumptions.</p>\n<p>Of course, important ideas should not be dropped or forgotten. On the contrary, they should be discussed and developed. But we should take care to keep open the dialogue between people who have spent a long time thinking about effective altruism, and those who are just encountering it for the first time. The ideas are natural, and have a broad appeal, and it would be a great shame if they never realised that broad appeal because the groups developing them became too specialised, too quickly.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 id=\"Be_nice_to_people\">Be nice to people</h2>\n<p>There are a couple of other traps to avoid. Firstly, using the terminology of a group in order to affiliate with that group. Sometimes it's useful to have specialist terms, but usually you don't need them. Using them makes the group look more insular to outsiders (which the effective altruist movement really isn't), and can also lead people reading arguments to take away the wrong message. Avoiding unnecessary terminology is part of not being too 'clannish' about effective altruism. It isn't \"us against the world\", since most people are really on our side.</p>\n<p>A particularly unhelpful line of thought runs as follows. Effective altruists are typically likely to do much more to help the world than other people. So given a choice between prioritising the resources (time or money, say) of effective altruists and others, it's good to favour the effective altruists. They are in practice \u2018more important\u2019 than regular people, even if you think all people\u2019s welfare matters equally.</p>\n<p>This last distinction is subtle and liable to be drowned out by the general distastefulness of the idea that people in a particular group matter more than others. It looks particularly bad if the reasoning is applied to oneself, as it is likely to be. Note that the argument doesn't need to be given explicitly to be harmful. If someone internalises the idea that they matter more than other people, elements of this are likely to show in conversation. Moreover, it can manifest itself in antisocial behaviour. Even if this is intended in the service of greater social good, there is a serious risk that the behaviour could become associated with effective altruism and taint the idea. If one of the most important things we can do is to help more people to become effective altruists (and right now, I think it is), it's important that we not just do good, but are seen to do good by society's standards. This mindset has a worrying potential to undo that. Be nice to people.</p><p></p><p><em>Acknowledgements: I\u2019d like to thank Nick Beckstead, Rebecca Cotton-Barratt, Toby Ord, Pablo Stafforini, Robert Wiblin, and Julia Wise for comments and suggestions on earlier drafts of this post.</em></p></div></div>"},

For donors who do not have high blood pressure, the chance of death during surgery is about 1.3/10,000<a href=\"#_ftn22\"><span><span><span>[22]</span></span></span></a> \u2013 about the same as in childbirth. For donors taken as a whole, it's 3.1/10,000.<a href=\"#_ftn23\"><span><span><span>[23]</span></span></span></a> Short-term complications affect about 2-5% of donors and typically involve things like wound infections.<a href=\"#_ftn24\"><span><span><span>[24]</span></span></span></a></span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The total QALY costs of this discomfort and risk are not large. The undiscounted QALY cost of a 3.1/10,000 risk to a person with 60 remaining years of perfect-quality life is 0.019 QALYs (roughly equivalent to a week of full value life). I haven't investigated the disability weights that should be applied, but assuming that a donor gets no value from their time in the hospital, half value from the following week, and \u00be value from the following 4 weeks before returning to full health, the total \"QALY cost\" of the operation, hospital stay, and recovery period is &lt;2 weeks. Combining the risk of death and the hospitalization and recovery period, we get costs of ~0.06 QALYs for donating.</span></p>\n<p><span>At face value, this may seem surprisingly low \u2013 donating a kidney is only as bad as giving up 3 weeks of life? Upon reflection, though, this makes sense \u2013 donors are able to return to work and most everyday activities within 4 weeks, and run only a <em>very </em>small risk of death. </span></p>\n<p><span>Note that the above assumes incurring zero utility from donating, but that\u2019s unlikely. Donors may have many positive experiences (e.g. reading, spending time with friends or family, developing interesting stories) during those 4 weeks and should expect a feeling of pride in the tangible and public accomplishment of donation even above what might be likely from a more abstractly-experienced financial gift. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the costs that prevent people from donating in practice seem to be psychological ones (i.e. fear) rather than these literal incapacitation costs.

Kidney donors must have very good kidney function pre-surgery, so their lifetime risk (if they do not donate) is about 0.14%. A 2014 study indicates that people who donate have a 0.9% lifetime chance of developing kidney failure.<a href=\"#_ftn28\"><span><span><span>[28]</span></span></span></a> </span></p>\n<p><span>The risk of kidney failure mounts over time and the risk of developing ESRD during one\u2019s working years are much lower. At age 50, only 0.28% of living donors had experience kidney failure.<a href=\"#_ftn29\"><span><span><span>[29]</span></span></span></a> As such the expected loss of income due to ESRD is very low. Kidney failure is typically the outcome of decades of degenerative kidney disease (in about half of cases this is caused by obesity and/or diabetes, so about half the risk is controllable by diet and exercise). Donating one\u2019s kidney likely does not increase the chance of that chronic kidney disease; instead, donating reduces one\u2019s total kidney function to about 70% of where it was before. Only donors with excellent kidney function are allowed to donate, so this does not typically have any health impacts. However, for those who develop chronic kidney disease in the future (a small number), donating reduces somewhat the buffer of excess function before chronic kidney disease leads to kidney failure.<a href=\"#_ftn30\"><span><span><span>[30]</span></span></span></a> </span></p>\n<p><span>There are several challenges to calculating long-term risk of living kidney donation. The first is that ESRD takes so long to develop. Given the medical advances in kidney donation, such as the switch to a laparoscopic procedure, it\u2019s possible that long-term risks of donation have diminished for current donors but have not yet showed up in the data. That said, the long progression of kidney disease may also imply that studies will tend to underestimate the failure effect due to limitations in follow-up duration,<a href=\"#_ftn31\"><span><span><span>[31]</span></span></span></a> and there may be significant uncertainty about health impact (trying to extrapolate to health effects thirty to fifty years in the future is very difficult). Finally, the significant majority of donors give to relatives making it possible that these related donors are actually at greater risk than unrelated donors<a href=\"#_ftn32\"><span><span><span>[32]</span></span></span></a> (and because of transplant center selection criteria, non-directed donors are likely to be healthier to start with than the average donor).</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While kidney failure for living donors remains tragic, living donors receive significant priority on the organ waitlist and are thus much more likely to receive a kidney transplant of their own.<a href=\"#_ftn33\"><span><span><span>[33]</span></span></span></a></span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, it seems appropriate to believe technological innovations like artificial organs are likely on a multi-decade timescale,<a href=\"#_ftn34\"><span><span><span>[34]</span></span></span></a> significantly reducing the expected costs of risking ESRD in middle or old age.

If the average patient develops kidney failure at 65, and the average donor receives a transplant, they should expect to live about 11 years with a disability weight of 0.84, compared to about 15.5 for Americans without ESRD, yielding a total estimated QALY cost of 0.063<a href=\"#_ftn35\"><span><span><span>[35]</span></span></span></a> or about three weeks.

Here\u2019s a quick back-of-the-envelop calculation to demonstrate. Say there is a 1% risk of kidney failure, and 50% chances each of retirement, technological improvement, ability to receive a transplant, and defection from the EA cause (each conservative estimates). Say that if none of those conditions holds one would lose $250K in charitable donations thirty years from now. This means that the expected loss will be $156.25 (250,000*.01*.5*.5*.5*.5) in 2044, but this figure needs to be discounted to net present value to be compared to a choice today. If you invest a dollar today at 5% annual compounding interest, in thirty years, it would be worth $4.32. Thus, the long-term income loss expected from kidney donation would be equivalent to paying $36.17 (156.25/4.32) today. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Immediate_Financial_Costs_of_Kidney_Donation\"><span>Immediate Financial Costs of Kidney Donation</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>The costs of surgery and of any complications from surgery are covered by the recipient\u2019s insurance (usually Medicare).

In the United States, there is no federal law requiring paid leave for organ donors. However, federal employees receive paid leave, as do employees in many states and employees of companies with generous benefits in other states.<a href=\"#_ftn36\"><span><span><span>[36]</span></span></span></a> The cost of donation for donors who do not receive paid leave is of course substantial. The other major cost of donation is travel, which is reimbursed by the National Living Donor Assistance Center for any donor whose recipient makes under 300% of the US poverty line, and is also under 300% of the poverty line.<a href=\"#_ftn37\"><span><span><span>[37]</span></span></span></a> The National Kidney Registry also reimburses all costs for donors who donate to start chains.</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are meaningful costs that are not reimbursed in the United States.

It fits effective altruist principles by being a gift that is significant to the donor and has a measurable and highly positive impact. This does not by any means imply that donating is the right decision for all (or even most) effective altruists since different people will value the costs of having surgery differently. </span></p>\n<p><strong><em><span>How Does Donating Compare to Other EA Choices</span></em></strong><span>? Donating a kidney is similar in direct impact to, but on the lower end of, other EA choices like giving money to a GiveWell recommended charity. Donating a kidney gets ~14 QALYs at a cost of something on the order of ~0.1 QALYs. If you can give a month of your life to extend someone else's by 14 years, that seems to be a good decision and one where a small sacrifice yields a significant gain for others. Believing that donating will encourage others to do so or that the returns to political advocacy are high could easily double these expected returns.</span></p>\n<p><span>GiveWell estimates the cost-per life saved for their top charities as ~$3-5K.<a href=\"#_ftn38\"><span><span><span>[38]</span></span></span></a> Assuming a healthy 50 year lifespan for those who are saved, this works out to $60-$100/DALY. GiveWell cautions not to take these cost-estimates literally, due to significant uncertainty around them.<a href=\"#_ftn39\"><span><span><span>[39]</span></span></span></a></span></p>\n<p><span>A possible EA critique to kidney donation is to say that, \"If donating a kidney will save ~14 QALYs and a developing world DALY only costs ~$100 to save, then donating a kidney is only worth $1,400 in donations.\" We think there is something true and important in this argument, and we wouldn't encourage someone to donate a kidney if it meant they would forego significant donations to GiveWell's top charities. But we don\u2019t see why that should be the case, since giving a kidney is a complement to and not a replacement for monetary donation. </span></p>\n<p><span>Put somewhat differently, \"donating a kidney is only worth $1,400 in donations\" takes our failure to donate the maximum we could and uses it to avoid orthogonal actions that would be extremely net beneficial but don't necessarily quite reach the benefit-cost threshold we've set for our financial donations.<a href=\"#_ftn40\"><span><span><span>[40]</span></span></span></a> This would also imply an incorrect fungibility between moral choices and is a principle that could lead to worse behavior in the long-run (i.e. constantly forgoing positive-utility actions whose gains are not the same as charitable donations with the best expected value). </span></p>\n<p><span>Donation may also have benefits personal to the donor, indirect to other transplant recipients, and supportive to the EA cause that are not accounted for in its direct QALY figure, and giving through non-financial donation may also be a useful diversification strategy for one\u2019s altruism. </span></p>\n<p><em><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Now vs. Later</strong></span></em><span>: If one intends to donate a kidney, donating now is significantly more effective than donating much later. Currently, the transplant shortage is serious, but future policy or technological change could greatly decrease the marginal benefit of kidney donation. That same change could cause a donation today to be a bridge for the recipient into a period with significantly decreased mortality for kidney failure that they would not otherwise have survived to. Opportunity to influence future donors and the political system are likely also higher now than later. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 From a risk perspective, donating when young is inferior to donating when old, because younger donors do not have as much information on future health conditions as older donors (i.e. a 50 year-old without chronic kidney disease will almost certainly never develop it, but a 25 year-old still could). For either group, the absolute risk of kidney failure is still small and less than that of the general population. However, we note that donors who are currently young are more likely to benefit from future advances in technology (such as artificial organs) that reduce the expected costs of donation.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em><span>EA Identity and Movement Building</span></em></strong><span>: One concern that has been expressed is that, since kidney donation is an unusual and serious choice, donation can marginally pull the EA movement away from the mainstream. This concern comes from a model of successful social movements as incremental and moderate.</span></p>\n<p><span>A different model finds movements do better when they are dramatic, salient, and compelling. Kidney donation is a very admired choice with clear and identifiable beneficiaries. It is a visible choice and attractive narrative that demonstrates significantly stronger commitment than a non-binding pledge to donate money in the future. It also may open opportunities for a broader discussion of EA principles. The more EAs save the lives of identifiable strangers, the more notice the movement gets and the better it looks.</span></p>\n<p><span>Additionally, much of the EA movement to date\u2014 GiveWell, Giving What We Can, and the earning to give discussion at 80,000 Hours\u2014has focused on money as the core resource we have to allocate. We don't disagree that decisions about money are important, but we think that the EA movement will be stronger and more compelling to newcomers if it can offer a broader variety of ways to make the world a better place. Kidney donation should very much be considered as one of those activities.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>\u00a0</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Conclusion\"><span>Conclusion</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Kidney donation confers direct benefits to recipients that clearly exceed the cost to the donor by a large factor (more than a hundred, according to our estimate).

{"date": "11th Sep 2014", "title": "Disability Weights", "author": "Jeff_Kaufman", "num_comments": "23 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>If you're talking to two people, one with a small cut and another with multiple sclerosis, everyone present will agree that having multiple sclerosis is much worse. If you offered the two of them some magic option that would restore exactly one of them to full health, they would probably be able to agree on who should get it. But in general, how should we compare across people to figure out whose situation is worse, who would benefit more from treatment and who, everything else being equal, should be treated first? This example was easy because the difference was nice and large, but what do we do in harder cases?</p>\n<p>One is to ask people questions like \"if there were a surgery that could restore you to full health (without improving your lifespan) but had a 20% chance of killing you, would you take it?\" If they say \"yes\" then this indicates that this disability, for this person, is more than 20% as bad as being dead. Ask these \"standard gamble\" questions to a lot of people with a lot of disabilities, varying the percentages, and you could build up a list of how bad different ones are, all on a common scale.</p>\n<p>This would useful for balancing projects against each other, figuring out what to focus on, and generally setting funding priorities. Unfortunately people are really bad at answering questions like this. Mostly we're just bad at thinking about percentages and chances of bad things happening, but you also wonder about the problems of asking someone with, say, \"Schizophrenia: acute state\" to answer this sort of question.</p>\n<p>You could fix this by asking people about \"time tradeoffs\". For example, you could ask someone with a disability about whether they would take a medicine that would restore them to full health for a year even if it took two years off their life. Alternatively you can ask people, generally public health professionals, if given the choice between curing 1000 people with disability X and 2000 people with disability Y which one they would choose. These \"person tradeoffs\" get us out of needing to ask about probabilities, which means we can probably trust the numbers more, but we're stuck either with collecting data from people with the disabilities in question (hard work, maybe the disability affects mental function) or trusting that public health experts fully understand what it's like to have different disabilities (seems unlikely). And even if we did decide that we were only going to collect data from people actually affected by a disability, remember that in many cases they can't actually give the comparison we want because they haven't experienced both having and not having the disability (ex: blindness from birth).</p>\n<p>The first Global Burden of Disease Report (<a href=\"http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/1996/0965546608_eng.pdf\">pdf</a>) attempted to collect these weights for a large number of different diseases. They got a panel of public health experts to come to Geneva and through discussion around \"person tradeoffs\" came to consensus first on weights for 22 \"indicator diseases\". Then they agreed on weights for the several hundred remaining diseases by comparing them to these anchor conditions.</p>\n<p>You might worry that the final weights would be really strongly affected by the particular consensus the Geneva group happened to get for the 22 anchors, but they ran nine other attempts with different experts and the average of those attempts correlates pretty well with the Geneva results:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.jefftk.com/disability-weights-indicator-conditions-1990.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>For the 2010 update to the Global Burden of Disease weights (<a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/gbdweights2010.pdf\">pdf</a>, also see the appendix <a href=\"https://profiles.uonbi.ac.ke/odundo_paul/files/common_values_in_assessing_health_outcomes.pdf\">pdf</a>) they decided to take an entirely different approach. Instead of asking experts to figure out tradeoffs they asked lots of people in several countries (Indonesia, Peru, USA, Bangladesh, Tanzania, plus a 'global' internet survey) to do lots of comparisons where given two people they would say which one was healthier. This makes a lot of sense, asking lots of regular people, and the question is much simpler to answer. On the other hand, while I'm not sure experts are all that good at estimating how bad it is to have various disabilities I would expect regular people to be even worse at it. Still, there was at least pretty good correlation between countries:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.jefftk.com/disability-weights-2010-by-country-2x.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>But hold on: how did they turn a large number of responses where people said one disability was more or less healthy than another into weightings on a 0-1 scale where 0 is full health and 1 is death? It turns out that a quarter (n=4000) of the people who took the survey on the internet were also asked the \"person tradeoff\" style questions used in the 1990 version, which they called \"population health equivalence questions\". So they first determined an ordering from most to least healthy using their large quantity of comparison data, and then used the tradeoff data to map this ordering onto the \"0=healthy 1=death\" line.</p>\n<p>This means that when we look at the cross-country correlations above we're only seeing their agreement on the relative ordering of conditions, not on the absolute differences. If people in Indonesia on average think that the worst disabilities are only 10% as bad as being dead while people in Peru think they're 90% as bad, this wouldn't keep them from having perfect correlation on a chart like this. Which is kind of a problem, because we need more than an ordering for prioritization.</p>\n<p>It turns out that this method of estimation actually gives pretty different results from the one used in the earlier version: [1]</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.jefftk.com/disability-weights-expert-vs-lay.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Yes, there's a correlation, but it's pretty weak. And it's probably not just about the fifteen years between when most of the first estimates were made and when most of the second were; these aren't disabilities that are quickly changing. This indicates that what we're trying to measure is just not that well captured by the measurements we're making.</p>\n<p>So, a summary. Getting good answers means asking people questions they're not good at thinking about, or that they are good at thinking about but don't have the right experience to be able to answer. It's not too surprising, then, that the answers you get via different methods don't agree very well. We do still need a rough way to say \"benefit X to N people is better/worse than benefit Y to M people\", but trying to do this in the general case doesn't seem to have worked out very well.</p>\n<p>These disability weights are only one step in estimating $/DALY for various interventions, and the messiness here is in some ways much less than the messiness in the other steps. After reading about how these estimates came to be, I'm pretty glad GiveWell <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/11/04/some-considerations-against-more-investment-in-cost-effectiveness-estimates/\">doesn't put much trust in them</a> in figuring out which charities to recommend:</p>\n<blockquote>The resources that have already been invested in these cost-effectiveness estimates are significant. Yet in our view, the estimates are still far too simplified, sensitive, and esoteric to be relied upon. If such a high level of financial and (especially) human-capital investment leaves us this far from having reliable estimates, it may be time to rethink the goal.\n<p>All that said\u2014if this sort of analysis were the only way to figure out how to allocate resources for maximal impact, we'd be advocating for more investment in cost-effectiveness analysis and we'd be determined to \"get it right\". But in our view, there are other ways of maximizing cost-effectiveness that can work better in this domain\u2014in particular, making limited use of cost-effectiveness estimates while focusing on finding high-quality evidence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This isn't to say we should never use disability weights; even if they were just made up by one guy on the spot (and they're better than that) this <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/02/if-its-worth-doing-its-worth-doing-with-made-up-statistics/\">would probably</a> still be better in some cases than refusing to make quantitative comparisons at all. Getting rough numbers like this is especially useful for avoiding scope insensitivity problems, where you might be comparing a large number of people with something minor against a small number with something major.</p>\n<p>(I'd really like to look into the QALY numbers people use and how they get them. I believe the process is similar, but I'm not too sure.)</p>\n<p>For curiosity, however, and with all that in mind, what are the actual numbers they found?

Even if you don\u2019t share my goal, I\u2019d like to share advice that can help you achieve more of what you\u2019d like.</p>\n<p><em>Download the </em> <a href=\"http://yboris.com/frugal.pdf\"><em>PDF</em></a> <em> or read:</em></p>\n<p>Frugality is a word that may have several meanings. It could mean not being lavish or extravagant with one\u2019s spending, or it could mean avoiding waste, or just being economical of monetary resources. I don\u2019t intend to argue for definitions, I\u2019d like to share the best advice I\u2019ve come across to help you think about using your money wisely.</p>\n<p>Because I am passionate about giving to charities, it\u2019s useful for me to be more cautious about spending my money, not just because I have less to spend on myself but also because I can have more of my money left to give. I\u2019ve been frugal most my life for various reasons; I now have an excellent reason. Regardless of why you\u2019d like to be frugal, I want to help you succeed.</p>\n<p>Personally I see frugality as using your money most effectively to achieve your goals. Because I don\u2019t care about television shows I can save money by skipping cable. Someone who enjoys TV too much to give it up may be pleased that Netflix or some other service can provide the same pleasure but for less money; sometimes a substitute service may even end up being a better fit!</p>\n<p>It\u2019s always great if you can save without giving up something, but it\u2019s not always possible; in the end, it\u2019s a trade-off between different things you can do with your money. You might save by not watching TV, but be rewarded by having vacation money. Figuring out what you prefer most may be the best step towards smarter spending.</p>\n<p>The most important principle I think everyone should be aware of is that we all have limited amount of money and thus must be discriminate about how to use it. Buying some things will bring us pleasures or allow us to accomplish some of our goals; but that spending necessarily means we\u2019ll have less financial resources to spend on other things and other goals. Figure out your goals first!</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Benefits_of_being_frugal_\">Benefits of being frugal:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li> More money left over for things you really care about </li>\n<li> Less things to transport when moving (time and money costs) </li>\n<li> Less things to store when living (maintenance costs) </li>\n<li> Less things to worry about (psychological costs) </li>\n<li> Less environmental impact </li>\n<li> If you choose to eat less, you\u2019ll stay healthier and live longer (see: <em>caloric restriction</em>) </li>\n</ul>\n<p><em> What follows is a list of numerous ideas and techniques. I don\u2019t use all, nor would I recommend all; but some people found each one very useful on their path to greater frugality. These are not in any particular order.

{"date": "25th Sep 2014", "title": "Lawyering to Give", "author": "Jeff_Kaufman", "num_comments": "14 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><blockquote>If you really want to do good by law, consider becoming a corporate lawyer, making a lot of money, and donating a substantial sum to charity.</blockquote>\n<p>Writing in the Harvard Law Record, Bill Barlow <a href=\"http://hlrecord.org/?p=19728\">argues</a> that a law student who goes into corporate law and gives 25% of their income to the best charities they can find will do more good than one who goes into academia, government, or public interest work.</p>\n<p>Sima Atri <a href=\"http://hlrecord.org/?p=19726\">responded</a> in the same edition of the Law Record, and Elie Mystal <a href=\"http://abovethelaw.com/2014/09/what-harvard-law-students-tell-themselves-when-the-demons-come/\">responded</a> in Above the Law a few days later. Both are solidly convinced that this is not an approach that benefits the world, let alone the best approach for a Harvard Law graduate. And both are convinced the arguments are obviously flawed:</p>\n<blockquote><em>Mystal:</em> It's pretty stupid. It's not absurd enough to achieve Jonathan Swift levels of parody, nor is it thought through enough to be taken seriously.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><em>Atri:</em> I am not responding to this article because I think the arguments merit the time and energy I will spend writing this up.</blockquote>\n<p>The main issue seems to be that both responders have dismissed the possibility that someone going into corporate law would actually donate 25% of their salary. This turns the \"earn money and give a lot of it away\" proposal into \"earn money and spend it on yourself,\" and it's not surprising that they wouldn't have much respect for someone arguing that you should do this:</p>\n<blockquote><em>Atri:</em> I can bet that almost no one going into corporate law next year is donating 30% of their post-tax income to charity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><em>Mystal:</em> To even get into this argument, you have to accept the premise that there is any Biglaw associate, anywhere, who is going to give away 25% of their post-tax salary. And you would have to be really dumb to accept that premise. It's a dumb premise, even if you assume that Biglaw associates are desperate to make charitable contributions to the world. Between rent and student loan payments, giving 25% away would make it a struggle for most associates to pay all their other bills. People don't bill 60 hours a week working for the greater good of corporate clients to be functionally poor.</blockquote>\n<p>Leaving aside that I know several people in corporate law who are earning to give, along with others in finance, teaching, software development, and other professions, they're making the wrong comparison. They're saying \"considering the people I know who are going into corporate law, I can't imagine them starting to donate 25% of their income to charity\". And they may well be right! The article isn't aimed at people who've already decided to go into corporate law, however, it's aimed at people who want to maximize the good they do. Consider each of the jobs Barlow describes relative to going into corporate law and keeping all the money. Each one has an amount of money you're passing up in order to do good, and an amount you keep:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Job</th><th>Income Kept</th><th>Income Forgone</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Corporate Law, donating 25%</td>\n<td>$75k</td>\n<td>$25k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Public Interest</td>\n<td>$33k</td>\n<td>$67k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Government</td>\n<td>$40k</td>\n<td>$60k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Academia</td>\n<td>$26k</td>\n<td>$74k</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Deciding to go into government law, for example, is like deciding to take a $100k job and donate everything above $40k. If Barlow's salary estimates are reasonable, someone going into corporate law and donating 25% has much more income left over for rent, student loan payments, and other expenses than someone choosing any of these other routes. Someone with an income of $75k is hardly \"functionally poor.\"</p>\n<p>After writing off the idea that people might donate 25% of their income (let alone <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/giving-half\">50%</a>) as unrealistic the responding authors then seem to just assume that Barlow actually meant a much lower number. For example:</p>\n<blockquote><em>Mystal:</em> I can just imagine a Big Phrama lawyer who spends six days a week to protect the company's patent monopoly on life-saving drugs, then cuts a check for $6 for a bug net and thinks he's done his good deed for the month.</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, of course that's wrong. Don't just donate $6/month! Barlow is proposing giving 25% of an $100k salary, or $2k/month. But this does get us into their second objection, which is more substantive: corporate law does harm:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<blockquote><em>Atri:</em> I say this because you are not choosing to go into neutral, apolitical, work. None of us working in the legal profession are. Your firm, Bill, has represented JPMorgan Chase, a bank that backed thousands of predatory and racist loans and helped create the foreclosure crisis. Your firm also (according to its website) \"routinely defends companies faced with serious products liability and consumer fraud claims ... involving thousands of claimants.\" For those thousands of claimants who were first harmed by faulty products, and then denied any remedy, your charity may be less than appreciated.</blockquote>\n<p>Going into corporate law means you should expect to be involved in a range of work, some of it harmful and some of it helpful. All of these situations could be either: patent monopolies are how we've ended up funding most of our drug research but loosening them up in some cases could be good; product liability and consumer fraud claims can go either way depending on the facts of the situation. But let's apply a \"<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2013/07/show-me-the-harm/\">show me the harm</a>\" style argument. There are <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/ooh/legal/lawyers.htm\">760k</a> lawyers in the US, and say half of them work in the private sector. That's 390k people. If you expect that someone going into corporate law while donating an amount that saves ~10 lives a year is harmful, then the net harm of corporate lawyers must more than 3.9M deaths a year. This is <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2013/07/show-me-the-harm/#fn:2\">14%</a> of total worldwide deaths, and this doesn't include corporate lawyers in other countries. This is enough deaths that it seems pretty clear donating 25% does far more good than the harm you could plausibly be doing as a lawyer.</p>\n<p>But what really worries me is when people start going down the path of \"money doesn't matter\":</p>\n<blockquote><em>Mystal:</em> People who are actually concerned about the public interest don't think that way. They don't think that currency is the only tender that can or should be offered up in an effort to make things better. They resist the endless attempts to commodify every action or inaction in this country with dollars and cents. The author estimates that you could save 150 lives a year by donating $25,000 to anti-malarial bug nets. That's a great use of your spare cash, but you've got nothing on the people who spend their <em>time</em> helping to distribute those bug nets, or even the people who teach proper bug net use.</blockquote>\n<p>This is wrong in a poisonous harmful way, more wrong than everything else in the piece. Altruism isn't <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/altruism-isnt-about-sacrifice\">about sacrifice</a>, it's not about whether you help via time, money, or materials, it's about having a positive impact on the people you're trying to help. If spending time distributing nets helps more people than spending time earning money to help fund a local organization that distributes nets then you should do that, but if it's the other way then you should earn the money and donate it instead. There's nothing categorically better about volunteering over other other ways of helping, and to say otherwise is to make giving about the donor instead of the people who really matter.</p>\n<p>So how would I object to Barlow's article? His estimate of the cost to save a life is too low, but even at a more likely $2500/life, donating 25% would be saving 10 lives a year. His dismissals of the value of government, academic, and public interest work are also too strong: while it's very hard to estimate the benefit of a career in, say, academia, I wouldn't write it off entirely. Ten deaths a year [1] is a steep opportunity cost to balance, but dramatic legal process improvements could probably have a benefit larger than that. So it still might be worth going into one of the other branches of law if you had a strong reason to believe your particular job would have very large benefits [2]. But overall I wouldn't object at all: the simple math of earning to give is very powerful.</p>\n<p><br> <small><em>I also posted this <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/lawyering-to-give\">on my blog</a>.<em></em></em></small> <br><br> [1] In fact it's more like 30, because the comparison for \"go into academia and earn $26k\" should be \"go into corporate law and donate all but $26k.\"</p>\n<p>[2] After accounting for <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/03/the-replaceability-effect-working-in-unethical-industries-part-1/\">replaceabilty</a>.</p></div></div>"},

But I was nervous about the potential health consequences of going vegan, and a lot of the guides to going vegan made it sound like a ridiculous amount of work. Some guides seemed to assume you loved spending lots of time cooking. Or they'd recommend other things I just couldn't see myself doing, like eating 6 cups of leafy greens per day for calcium. (6 cups may not sound like a lot, until you go to the grocery story and realize the big bags they sell there are only 2.5 cups. Try to imagine yourself eating two or more of those bags <em>every day.</em>)</p>\n<p>Eventually, though, I worked out a diet plan that would be both healthy and easy to follow. Cooking effort is minimal; everything can be made with a microwave and rice cooker. I don't claim the following diet is nutritionally optimal <em>a la</em> Soylent or MealSquares, but I <em>do </em>think it's probably healthier than the diet of the average American omnivore:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plan on getting most of your calories and protein from a mix of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal\">cereals</a> (bread, corn, rice, etc.) and legumes (beans, lentils, peanuts, soy, etc.)</li>\n<li>Keep fruit and vegetables around to snack on. A handful of baby carrots per day will take care of all your vitamin A needs.</li>\n<li>Adding a moderate amount of iodized salt to your meals is probably good idea, for both nutrition and taste.</li>\n<li>There are just two nutrients that you'll really need to get from supplements (or foods fortified with them): calcium and vitamin B12.\u00a0</li>\n<li>I also take a vitamin D3 + K2 supplement, but that has more to do with not getting much sun than with veganism.</li>\n<li>So that your diet isn't <em>completely </em>boring, keep an eye out for good vegan and vegan-friendly grocery stores and restaurants. Chipotle and Trader Joe's are two examples of good vegan-friendly national chains.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>Looking over these bullet points, part of me doesn't believe it's really that simple... but it's what I'm doing, and I have no major worries about my health or ability to be happy with this diet over the long haul. You should be aware that iron is an issue for <em>some </em>people, but most people don't have to worry about it. Also, there\u00a0<em>may </em>be benefits from making an effort to consume creatine and omega-3 fatty acids, but if worrying about them seems like too much of a hassle, you'll probably be fine.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Since many in the Bay Area effective altruist community are into low-carb dieting for weight-loss purposes, I should address that. The most prominent low-carb advocates, like Gary Taubes and the late Robert Atkins, have made claims that simply have no scientific basis. For example, both have claimed that people can eat unlimited amounts of fatty foods and not gain weight, because only carbs cause weight gain. I've never heard Taubes give a coherent account of how this is supposed to be true; Atkins claimed it was due to excess calories being excreted in the urine as ketones, but <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1753-4887.1974.tb05180.x/abstract\">urine ketone levels are too small for this to be possible</a>.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Some studies comparing low-carb diets to other diets have found <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2949959/?log%24=activity\">essentially no difference</a>\u00a0in terms of weight-loss, while others have found <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0708681#t=articleResults\">modest benefits for low-carb diets over low-fat diets</a>. Based on my own personal experience, and reading Yoni Freedhoff's book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Diet-Fix-Diets-Yours/dp/0804137579\">The Diet Fix</a>, </em>I suspect any benefits of low-carb diets come from the fact that they also tend to be high-protein. I've found that eating high-protein plant foods like soy and lentils works wonders in terms of my ability to eat in moderation without feeling hungry. For the past couple of weeks, I've actually been making a conscious effort to eat <em>more </em>calories, mostly to avoid having to buy new pants again.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>A final point to note is that there may be an <a href=\"http://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/\">ethical case for eating bivalves</a>.

And you can now\u00a0</em><em><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/donate-in-your-will.html\">get a free will by completing this form</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Many effective altruists will be interested in leaving some of their money to cost-effective charities when they die. In fact (2015 update!) Charity Science now has a <a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/donate-in-your-will.html\">simple form</a> to make a will leaving money to GiveWell's recommended charities and they'll help you write your will for free. I\u2019ve also written the following guide to explain how to do so. It walks you through writing a will from start to finish; I\u2019ve based it on my own experience when I first did this a few years ago (with a lawyer\u2019s help), plus some additional research to cover people from the US, Canada and Switzerland. I hope that you will find it helpful - if you do, <a href=\"mailto:publicaddress@effectivealtruismhub.com\">I\u2019d love to hear from you</a>! If you have any other helpful tips on this subject, do leave them in the comments section.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that, even leaving aside the fact that you may want to bequeath some of your money to charity, writing a will is a prudent thing to do. If you die without one, your assets will be distributed according to the law of your country rather than according to your own wishes. This could, for example, mean that your partner gets nothing if you\u2019re not married or in a civil partnership. That\u2019s worth avoiding.</p>\n<p>Just a few of the other reasons to take the time to write a will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reducing the inheritance tax incurred - leaving money to charity being an excellent way to do so.</li>\n<li>Making provision for your children if you have any, for example by choosing who will take care of them and setting aside funds for this.</li>\n<li>Making any other necessary provisions, such as for your pets, or your business, or other responsibilities that you have.</li>\n<li>Specifying what sort of funeral you would like, which will spare your family from having to make the decision.</li>\n<li>Declaring that you would like your organs donated, and/or your body donated to science. Be sure to tell your next of kin about this in case it comes up unexpectedly.</li>\n<li>Naming your executors (family members are a standard choice).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Step_one__decide_how_much_you_want_to_leave_to_charity\">Step one: decide how much you want to leave to charity</h2>\n<p>The main choice here is whether you want to bequeath a fixed amount to your chosen charities, or else first make provision for your near and dear and then leave the remainder. If you go for the first option, you simply need to add a clause to your will specifying the amount and the charity or charities that you pick. If you pick the second option, you\u2019ll need to add a clause like the following at the end of your will:</p>\n<blockquote>\"MY TRUSTEES shall stand possessed of the residue of the said monies and of such of my estate as remains for the time being unsold UPON TRUST for [insert the charity that you pick], AND I DECLARE that the receipt of the Treasurer or other proper Officer for the time being of the aforesaid body shall be a good and sufficient discharge to my Trustees in respect of the same.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Here, \u201cthe residue of the said monies\u201d means the money that is left over after the provisions made in previous clauses. For example, if you want to leave your personal effects and the first \u00a325,000 of your savings to a relative before giving the remainder to charity, you would first have your will state this, and afterwards add a clause like the above. The exact language comes from my own will, so has legal language appropriate to the UK; as I explain below, you should ensure that the language you use is appropriate in your jurisdiction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Step_two__pick_a_method_for_writing_your_will\">Step two: pick a method for writing your will</h2>\n<p>One of the reasons why so many people die intestate every year is that they don\u2019t realise how easy writing a will really is unless your financial affairs or wishes are unusually complex. In most countries it is possible to do it yourself by using a template, although you should be aware that using a lawyer is the safest option as it will ensure that your will is valid.</p>\n<p>If you decide to make a DIY will, you\u2019ll want to find a template that is appropriate for your jurisdiction. Americans can start by <a href=\"http://www.docracy.com/doc/showalltagged?sortBy=3&amp;page=3&amp;tag=Will\">searching this list at Docracy</a>, an open collection of sample legal documents. Brits can find <a href=\"http://www.compactlaw.co.uk/free-legal-documents.html\">free templates at compactlaw.co.uk</a>, or buy a <a href=\"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/products/last-will-and-testament-diy-will-kit-valid-in-uk/90009259\">cheap DIY kit from WH Smith</a>. Canadians can use <a href=\"http://www.gblegalclinic.com/Will%20kit.pdf\">this guide</a>.</p>\n<p>If like me you\u2019re from the UK, there are several schemes which let you make a will with a lawyer for free. Every November many solicitors participate in <a href=\"http://www.willaid.org.uk/\">\u2018WillAid\u2019</a>, which is a free service in exchange for which they suggest you make a donation of about \u00a3100 to charity - an offer which should appeal to EAs! Similarly, each September Scottish residents can get a will through <a href=\"http://www.willreliefscotland.co.uk/\">Will Relief Scotland</a> in exchange for a donation to a global poverty charity. And if you\u2019re 55 or over you can also take advantage of the <a href=\"http://freewillsmonth.org.uk/\">Free Wills Month scheme </a>in October.</p>\n<p>A final alternative is to pay a lawyer to make a will for you. Here, searching for a cheap online lawyer is a good approach. Right now, affordable options in the UK are <a href=\"http://www.quickonlinewills.com/\">quickonlinewills.com</a> and <a href=\"https://www.glosslegal.co.uk/\">glosslegal.co.uk</a>. Americans can use <a href=\"http://www.legalmatch.com/\">legalmatch.com</a>\u2019s search facility. Canadians can find a lawyer through the Law Society in their province.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Step_three__consider_inheritance_tax\">Step three: consider inheritance tax</h2>\n<p>In most countries leaving money to charity will reduce the inheritance tax payable. For example, in the US gifts to charities are exempt from federal wealth transfer taxes, gift and estate taxes, and appear to be exempt from state taxes. In the UK a charitable legacy it will be deducted from your estate before the amount of inheritance tax is calculated, and if you leave over 10% of your estate\u2019s net value to charity, any part of your estate that is subject to inheritance tax will be taxed at 36% rather than 40%.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Step_four__pick_your_charities_and_find_out_how_to_leave_money_to_them\">Step four: pick your charities and find out how to leave money to them</h2>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to specify your chosen charity or charities. Note that only charities that are tax-deductible in your country will entitle you to inheritance tax breaks. <strong>I\u2019ve made a <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/actions/donating\">webpage which lets you find these</a> by selecting your charity and then following the resultant links.</strong></p>\n<p>Rather than specifying one particular charity, effective altruists may wish to bequeath money to whatever charities GiveWell considers most effective at the time they die (the examples I\u2019ve focused on in this guide). In the US, you can do this by leaving the money to GiveWell, earmarked for regranting to its recommended charities. They would then follow their recommended split across their top charities, just as they do when people donate via them for regranting. This is the split which they think does the most good, taking into account charities\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/scalability\">room for more funding</a> and other factors. It\u2019s the path I\u2019ve taken after talking to GiveWell employees about this, and one I\u2019d recommend for others.</p>\n<p>Either way - and especially if you've specified an end charity rather than GiveWell, which is likely to stay in existence - it is a good idea to name fallbacks in case your beneficiaries aren't around when you end your days. You can name particular charities, but as a final fallback you should at least give disbursement instructions that your executors can follow whatever charities are around. Here is the flexible language that my solicitor advised me to include in my will, having told my executors (my immediate family) my wishes without having to put these into legally binding language:</p>\n<blockquote>But if the trusts hereinbefore declared shall fail or determine then and in that event my Trustees shall stand possessed of the said residue of my estate UPON TRUST to transfer pay or apply the same to or for such exclusively charitable institution or purpose or exclusively charitable institutions or purposes and if more than one in such proportions as my Trustees may in their absolute discretion select.</blockquote>\n<p>Here are some specific instructions for this step for people in living in the countries below:</p>\n<h3 id=\"US\">US</h3>\n<p><a title=\"Find tax-deductible charities in your country\" href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/actions/donating\"><img src=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/sites/effectivealtruismhub.com/media/images/icons-etc/flags/us.png\" alt=\"us\"></a></p>\n<p>Americans can leave money to GiveWell for regranting directly, leaving the money \u201cto GiveWell (Employer Identification Number: 20-8625442), earmarked for regranting to its recommended charities\u201d. Bequests require only stating the amount and naming the beneficiary, as in this sample wording.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Canada\">Canada</h3>\n<p><a title=\"Find tax-deductible charities in your country\" href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/actions/donating\"><img src=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/sites/effectivealtruismhub.com/media/images/icons-etc/flags/canada.png\" alt=\"canada\"></a></p>\n<p>Canadians can donate to proven global charities via Charity Science, the organisation that I work with, leaving the money \u201cto Charity Science (charity number: 80963 6236 RR0001) of Vancouver, BC\". You can specify which charities you would like us to route your money to, and can discuss this with us by emailing <a href=\"mailto:joey@charityscience.com\">joey@charityscience.com</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"UK\">UK</h3>\n<p><a title=\"Find tax-deductible charities in your country\" href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/actions/donating\"><img src=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/sites/effectivealtruismhub.com/media/images/icons-etc/flags/uk.png\" alt=\"uk\"></a></p>\n<p>You can bequeath money to GiveWell\u2019s recommended charities in the UK via the Giving What We Can Trust, with language like the following, from my own will:</p>\n<blockquote>\u201cMY TRUSTEES shall stand possessed of the residue of the said monies and of such of my estate as remains for the time being unsold UPON TRUST for the Giving What We Can Trust (Registered Charity Number: 1155773) of 6 Temple Mews, 6 Temple Road, Cowley, Oxford, OX4 2DY earmarked for GiveWell for regranting to GiveWell's recommended global poverty charities, at GiveWell's discretion, AND I DECLARE that the receipt of the Treasurer or other proper Officer for the time being of the aforesaid body shall be a good and sufficient discharge to my Trustees in respect of the same\u201d</blockquote>\n<p>Alternatively you can leave money to the Giving What We Can Trust directly and specify the charities to which it should be routed in an alternative way, such as following the Trust\u2019s default split (25% each to the charities that Giving What We Can recommends: AMF, SCI, Deworm the World and Project Healthy Children).</p>\n<h3 id=\"Switzerland_and_Germany\">Switzerland and Germany</h3>\n<p><a title=\"Find tax-deductible charities in your country\" href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/actions/donating\"><img src=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/sites/effectivealtruismhub.com/media/images/icons-etc/flags/switzerland.png\" alt=\"switzerland\"></a></p>\n<p>Swiss and German taxpayers can donate to GiveWell-recommended charities tax-efficiently via <a href=\"http://gbs-schweiz.org/\">GBS Schweiz</a> (one of the Swiss EA organisations). Instructions can be found <a href=\"http://gbs-schweiz.org/tax/\">here</a>, and if you wish to bequeath money via GBS you can contact them about this <a href=\"http://gbs-schweiz.org/informationen/kontakt/\">here</a>. They hope that this will soon be possible for Austrians too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Step_five__make_your_will\">Step five: make your will</h2>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve made the key decisions you can make your will via the method you picked in step two. You will need to sign and date it with witnesses, who will also need to sign it - in the UK, you need two witnesses, neither of whom can be beneficiaries. You\u2019ll then simply need to follow the requirements for storing it that apply in your country. Wills are often stored by solicitors, although in many countries you can instead keep a copy in a safe place at home. Either way, be sure to tell the executors that you\u2019ve named in your will where it is stored.</p>\n<h2 id=\"___and_that_s_it\">...and that\u2019s it</h2>\n<p>Armed with the above guide, you should now be able to write your own will, and - if you choose to do so - leave some of your money to the very best charities out there. Morbid though the topic inevitably is, I hope that some of you will find this helpful!

{"date": "11th Dec 2014", "title": "Make your own cost-effectiveness Fermi estimates for one-off problems", "author": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt", "num_comments": "8 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span>In some </span><a href=\"/ea/c3/estimating_the_costeffectiveness_of_research/\"><span>recent work</span></a><span> (particularly </span><a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/estimating-cost-effectiveness/\"><span>this article</span></a><span>) I built models for estimating the cost effectiveness of work on problems when we don\u2019t know how hard those problems are. The estimates they produce aren\u2019t perfect, but they can get us started where it\u2019s otherwise hard to make comparisons.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Now I want to know: what can we use this technique on? I have a couple of applications I am working on, but I\u2019m keen to see what estimates other people produce.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>There are complicated versions of the model which account for more factors, but we can start with a simple version. This is a tool for initial Fermi calculations: it\u2019s relatively easy to use but should get us around the right order of magnitude. That can be very useful, and we can build more detailed models for the most promising opportunities.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>The model is given by:</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/equation8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><span><span>This expresses the expected benefit of adding another unit of resources to solving the problem. You can denominate the resources in dollars, researcher-years, or another convenient unit. To use this formula we need to estimate four variables:</span></span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>R</span><span>(0)</span><span> denotes the current resources going towards the problem each year. Whatever units you measure </span><span>R</span><span>(0) in, those are the units we\u2019ll get an estimate for the benefit of. So if </span><span>R</span><span>(0) is measured in researcher-years, the formula will tell us the expected benefit of adding a researcher year.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>You want to count all of the resources going towards the problem. That includes the labour of those who work on it in their spare time, and some weighting for the talent of the people working in the area (if you doubled the budget going to an area, you couldn\u2019t get twice as many people who are just as good; ideally we\u2019d use an elasticity here).</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Some resources may be aimed at something other than your problem, but be tangentially useful. We should count some fraction of those, according to how much resources devoted entirely to the problem they seem equivalent to.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>B</span><span> is the annual benefit that we\u2019d get from a solution to the problem. You can measure this in its own units, but whatever you use here will be the units of value that come out in the cost-effectiveness estimate.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>p</span><span> </span><span>and </span><span>y/z</span><span> are parameters that we will estimate together. </span><span>p</span><span> </span><span>is the probability of getting a solution by the time </span><span>y</span><span> resources have been dedicated to the problem, if </span><span>z</span><span> </span><span>resources have been dedicated so far. Note that we only need the ratio </span><span>y/z</span><span>, so we can estimate this directly.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Although </span><span>y/z</span><span> is hard to estimate, we will take a (natural) logarithm of it, so don\u2019t worry too much about making this term precise.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>I think it will often be best to use middling values of </span><span>p</span><span>, perhaps between 0.2 and 0.8.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>And that\u2019s it. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Example:</span><span> How valuable is extra research into nuclear fusion? Assume:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>R(0) = $5 billion</span><span> (after a quick google turns up $1.5B for current spending, and adjusting upwards to account for non-financial inputs);</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>B = $1000 billion</span><span> (guesswork, a bit over 1% of the world economy; a fraction of the current energy sector);</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>There\u2019s a 50% chance of success (</span><span>p = 0.5</span><span>) by the time we\u2019ve spent 100 times as many resources as today (</span><span>log(y/z) = log(100) = 4.6</span><span>). </span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><span><span><br></span></span></div>\n<p><span>Putting these together would give an expected societal benefit of (0.5*$1000B)/(5B*4.6) = </span><span>$22 for every dollar spent</span><span>. This is high enough to suggest that we may be significantly under-investing in fusion, and that a more careful calculation (with better-researched numbers!) might be justified.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"Caveats\"><span>Caveats</span></h2>\n<p><span>To get the simple formula, the model made a number of assumptions. Since we\u2019re just using it to get rough numbers, it\u2019s okay if we don\u2019t fit these assumptions exactly, but if they\u2019re totally off then the model may be inappropriate. One restriction in particular I\u2019d want to bear in mind:</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>It should be plausible that we could solve the problem in the next decade or two.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><span><span><br></span></span></div>\n<p><span>It\u2019s okay if this is unlikely, but I\u2019d want to change the model if I were estimating the value of e.g. trying to colonise the stars.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"Request_for_applications\"><span>Request for applications</span></h2>\n<p><span>So -- what would you like to apply this method to? What answers do you get?</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>To help structure the comment thread, I suggest attempting only one problem in each \u00a0comment. Include the </span><span>value of </span><span>p</span><span>, and the </span><span>units of </span><span>R</span><span>(0)</span><span> and </span><span>units of </span><span>B</span><span> that you\u2019d like to use. Then you can give your estimates for </span><span>R</span><span>(0), </span><span>B</span><span>, and </span><span>y/z</span><span> as a comment reply, and so can anyone else who wants to give estimates for the same thing.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I\u2019ve also set up a </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pxtY9qbP0qrCEMLlZGxYa6xkqCbkXXB1ciGl-ucf2rY/edit#gid=0\"><span>google spreadsheet</span></a><span> where we can enter estimates for the questions people propose. For the time being anyone can edit this.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Have fun!</span></p></div></div>"},

This month\u2019s topic is \"blind spots\". \u00a0The blind spot I see in the EA community is insufficient attention to how we can raise money and spread EA to our friends.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Note: Because Charity Science is a Canadian non-profit, all dollar figures in this post are in Canadian dollars.</span></p>\n<p><span>Previously

Kitten\u2019\u201d</a></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>-</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>I've been involved with </span><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/\"><span>Charity Science</span></a><span> since the beginning -- before their founding, actually. \u00a0The goal of Charity Science is to do a bunch of lightweight fundraising experiments to see what works in fundraising and spreading effective altruism to the laypublic.</span></p>\n<p><span>I was excited when one of the things Joey Savoie and Xio Kikauka, the co-founders of Charity Science, did to fundraise was just try to directly fundraise from their friends, no frills involved. \u00a0They launched simple fundraisers on the YouCaring platform, asking for donations on their birthdays rather than for money, raising </span><a href=\"http://www.youcaring.com/nonprofits/i-m-donating-my-birthday-to-those-who-need-it-more-than-me/199753\"><span>$1000</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"http://www.youcaring.com/nonprofits/xio-s-donating-her-birthday-/152566\"><span>$1170</span></a><span> respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I then suggested to them that they expand upon this and get other people to donate their birthdays as well. \u00a0This went pretty well, with Gina Stussey raising $250 and Kaj Sotala raising $500. \u00a0But then something unexpected came about -- Theron Pummer, a philosophy post-doc associated with </span><a href=\"http://www.populationethics.org/\"><span>FHI\u2019s Population Ethics Project</span></a><span>, raised $8036 from </span><a href=\"http://www.youcaring.com/other/i-m-donating-my-birthday-/227539\"><span>his birthday fundraiser</span></a><span> (~$2K USD / $2.3K CAD from his page and the rest from a large donor). \u00a0Charity Science was able to secure matching funds for this, catapulting his total raise to an atmospheric $16,072.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>When my birthday came around, I was eager to try to run a fundraiser myself. \u00a0I was curious how much I would raise. \u00a0I was pretty sure that Theron was just a wizard, and that I would aim for a more modest goal of $500, which would become $1K with the matching that Charity Science would provide. \u00a0So I </span><a href=\"http://birthday.causevox.com/peter-hurford\"><span>set up my fundraiser</span></a><span> using the flashy CauseVox platform that Charity Science had just set up, and started raising money.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>...It turned out that Theron wasn't a wizard.</span></p>\n<p><span>Two days into my fundraiser I already exceeded my $1K goal (with matching), and doubled my fundraiser to $2K. \u00a0Four days after that, I crossed $2K and re-aimed for $3K. \u00a0That same day, $3K was met and I set my sights on $4K. \u00a0$4K remained elusive until the very last day of the fundraiser, when I crossed $4K and sailed all the way onto and past $5K that very day.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I consider myself pretty ordinary with regard to my interpersonal skills, maybe even a bit below average. \u00a0I'm certainly not a professional fundraiser by any means. \u00a0I raised this $5K using 15 simple tips that I'm confident any EA could replicate, as long as they're willing to put in the hard work.</span></p>\n<p><span><img

alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>TIP #1: There is no substitute for hours behind the wheel</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>When I was learning how to drive, my Dad told me that there is no substitute for hours behind the wheel. \u00a0I could try to optimize my lesson plan, but ultimately there was nothing I could do but put in the many hours it takes to learn how to drive a car safely. \u00a0Everything else in my life has been the same. \u00a0Including fundraising.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>There certainly are ways to work smarter not harder here, and I'll share those tips. \u00a0But even with those optimizations, I still spent 17 hours directly on running my fundraiser. \u00a0Yes, I got bored and demotivated at times, but then I reminded myself that all of those hours would be me earning an effective wage of ~$295 per hour.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you're already earning more than $295 an hour, you get a free pass on running a fundraiser. \u00a0But for the rest of us, very few things we do earn us $295 per hour of effort. \u00a0Do you like the idea of earning $295 per hour? \u00a0If so, run a fundraiser, and spend a lot of time on it.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>TIP #2: Contact A LOT of people, 1-on-1, in a personal and genuine manner</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Want to raise a lot of money for charity? \u00a0Clear your calendar for a weekend, sit down, and start reconnecting with your friends.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Err on the side of contacting more people rather than less. \u00a0The people who give might surprise you, and while I far-and-above raised more money from people I knew more recently and had kept in touch with (e.g., talked to them this year), I raised a decent amount of money based on pretty flimsy connections (e.g., people I barely talked to in college or people I hadn't talked to in 4+ years).</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>My rule of thumb was (1) \"would I genuinely be interested in hearing about what this person is up to?\" and (2) \"do I expect this person to care about a life update from me?\". \u00a0If the answer to both these questions was yes, I contacted them -- no exceptions.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I booted Facebook, and looked through my friends list, and made a note of everyone who met my dual criteria. \u00a0I then made a list of all the contexts in which I knew friends -- from work, from college, from high school, and from family -- and tried to fill in people who may have fallen through the FB cracks. \u00a0(There were a few -- notably, I don't have anyone from my work on Facebook.) </span></p>\n<p><span>That resulted in 152 names. \u00a0I then sent a personalized message to 149 of them (for three people, I couldn't get up-to-date contact information).</span></p>\n<p><span>That message looked something like this:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span><span>Hey Samantha,</span></span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span><span>It was great to see you and Kyle at the Event Workshop in June. \u00a0Thank you for driving me to the bus station on time; I was worried that I wouldn't be able to get a ride! \u00a0I did manage to get home safe and sound. \u00a0How have things gone since then for you? \u00a0How are things with Jim?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>I've personally been having a good time living in Chicago. \u00a0I work as a data scientist in a start-up here, doing analytics work. \u00a0While not doing that, I've been helping out two of my friends, who have started a non-profit. \u00a0They work to end malaria in Africa. \u00a0Since my birthday is coming up on December 11, I've decided to donate my birthday to them and run a birthday fundraiser to help raise money to fight malaria.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><br></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>For just $10, you can buy three bed nets -- these are nets that a family sleeps under that prevents mosquitoes from getting to them, stopping them from getting malaria (since malaria-carrying mosquitoes only strike at night). \u00a0This is an amazing buy in healthcare, and has been backed as one of the best \"bangs for your buck\" in charity by the United Nations. \u00a0Also, it gets better -- thanks to an anonymous benefactor, every dollar you give will be doubled!</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><br></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>My birthday fundraising campaign is here if you want to donate: http://birthday.causevox.com/peter-hurford</span></span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span><span>But if you don't want to donate or don't have anything to chip in, that's totally ok. \u00a0I'm still happy for your support and would love to know how things are doing.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><br></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Best,</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Peter</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>(Of course, don\u2019t just copy this message and tweak it, because it has to sound like it actually came from you, or it\u2019s not genuine.)</span></p>\n<p><span>...In some cases I had to improvise on the fly. \u00a0Some people already knew about my job in Chicago, so it would be silly to tell them again. \u00a0For some, I squeaked by with a \"I probably already told you this, but just in case you forgot...\" but for others I had to re-write that section completely, usually just mentioning the non-profit part (which I really haven't told many people about).</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Note that it's the personal intro in the beginning that makes all the difference, and separates your genuine message from spam. \u00a0I tried hard to spend about 1-2 minutes personalizing this for each person. \u00a0Of course, some people I knew less well and didn't have a hook, so I had to ask more general questions, like about their Thanksgiving. \u00a0Notably, the people I knew less well responded much less. \u00a0(Though, if you\u2019re short on time, it does appear that less personalized emails have worked well for other people, like Theron.)</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Doing this, I got 71 responses (response rate 47.6%!) and at least 33 of the people I contacted did donate (possibly more because of anonymous donations).</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>TIP #3: Remember, people will be grateful for the chance to help you</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>I originally felt bad about messaging people about this -- I was taking time out of their day for what could be construed as a spammy message. \u00a0While I can't say what the people who didn't respond thought, the people who did respond were really grateful to help out. \u00a0Some choice quotes...</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>\"I have always been impressed by your dedication to put time and money where your mouth is on ethics, so I'd be glad to help out there.\"</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>\"super cool that your friends started a non-profit working with the Against Malaria Foundation plus that you are giving up your birthday for an amazing cause\"</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>\"I will be happy to make a donation and thank you for asking. I am glad to hear you are still involved with community service. I think it is so important to volunteer time and passion towards something you believe in.\"</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>...and there were </span><span>many</span><span> other responses along those lines.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>TIP #4: Use psychology in your messaging</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I've been studying psychology, persuasion, and fundraising, and I was curious to try out some of the influence tricks I had learned. \u00a0I was very intentional with how I crafted my message. \u00a0Of course, I can't say if any of these tricks worked (for all I know they may have even backfired!), but it seemed like my best bet.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Starting the message personal made the message genuine and not spammy. \u00a0I genuinely want to re-connect.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>I asked questions such as \"How are things going with you?\" rather than statements like \"I hope things are going well\". \u00a0This leads people to be more likely to respond, to answer those questions.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>I'm fundraising for myself and a friend, not the detached Against Malaria Foundation or GiveWell. \u00a0People want to help me, because I'm nice and it's my birthday. \u00a0They care less about the actual organization we're supporting. If you're not friends with Joey and Xio, this tactic might be less genuine, but you could become their friends!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>I'm donating my birthday. \u00a0This is a special occasion, and not a random solicitation.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>I indirectly suggest a donation of $10 even though this doesn't make a lot of sense in context. \u00a0From my reading of the Obama campaign, $10 is a good suggestion for millennials. \u00a0Probably not by coincidence, lots of people gave me precisely $10. \u00a0Note that I didn't directly suggest $10, which I think would have come across as rude.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>I give credibility to the intervention by associating it with the United Nations. \u00a0(Yes, this is </span><a href=\"http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/global-health/preventing-malaria-deaths.html\"><span>an actual thing</span></a><span>.) \u00a0Many more people recognize the United Nations than GiveWell and see the UN as a genuine authority, even though GiveWell is important. \u00a0Note that I don't mention GiveWell (or \"effective altruism\"), so as to not confuse the message.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>I mention donation matching. \u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w12338\"><span>People love their donation getting matched</span></a><span>. \u00a0(I didn\u2019t try out the </span><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/10/30/7131345/overhead-free-donations-charity-fundraising-seed-matching-gneezy\"><span>no overhead trick</span></a><span> because I was wary of spreading the anti-overhead myth and I didn\u2019t want the message to be too long.)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>I reaffirm that people don't have to donate if they don't want to or can't. \u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.spring.org.uk/2013/02/the-one-really-easy-persuasion-technique-everyone-should-know.php\"><span>People love having their freedom of choice affirmed</span></a><span>.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<p><span>TIP #5: Follow up with people</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>When people respond to your message, you should obviously follow up in a timely manner. \u00a0That's just being polite. \u00a0But what about the people who don't respond?</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Ideally you should wait a few days and then follow-up. \u00a0Many people want to donate, but are too busy, or get side-tracked. \u00a0Several of the people I reminded expressed appreciation for the reminder, and no one seemed put off by it. \u00a0Non-profits with actual fundraising campaigns do follow-ups all the time.</span></p>\n<p><span>I didn't follow up with everyone. \u00a0I actually only followed up with people who replied to me, mentioned something about promising to donate (e.g., \"I'd love to help out!\"), but didn't actually donate. \u00a0Following up got a good amount of donations that probably would have fallen on the wayside otherwise, and I probably ought to have followed up more than I actually did.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Here\u2019s the follow-up I sent:</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>Hey Emily,</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I hope finals are wrapping up well.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>If you're still interested in supporting my fundraiser, just wanted to let you know that the deadline for donations is the end of the day tomorrow. \u00a0We've already raised over $3500, and all donations are still being matched dollar-for-dollar!</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Here's the fundraising page: http://birthday.causevox.com/peter-hurford</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, do remember to personally thank your donors (at least the ones that don't donate anonymously)!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>TIP #6: Make it into a sales funnel</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I love the idea of making things into sales funnels whenever appropriate, which is more times than you might think. \u00a0You don't contact 149 people without having some good way of tracking what's going on.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/H5HRSvP6d6R-Y3q1oRDWvip2UCZ0y2aDzhYkIb99CLhWb8biztXrElHNZ85TZF6pTCk10a7htRGYP-I277tp6botdTiaHtuwnRHZdZgZnnT5RvkMd1rMlAXsAzIFsDMq5A\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-12-20 at 5.52.36 PM.png\"></span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Here, I made sure that each person got contacted at least once (\"green\" first box) and then followed up where appropriate.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I marked the \"Sold?\" column in grey if they had not yet responded to my message, orange if they responded and I needed to reply back, blue if we were in a conversation (they had responded and I had replied back), black if they told me explicitly they weren't going to donate (only happened twice), and green if they did end up making a donation.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I used the notes column to keep track of how they responded, and whether they had promised to donate or not.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>This might be a bit too freaky organized, but it really helped.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>TIP #7: Don't neglect publishing on social media too</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>While the 1-on-1 contacts are the biggest drivers of donations, posting about the campaign on Facebook ended up being more important than I had realized, since it (a) drove donations from a few people I didn't think to ask 1-on-1, and (b) acted as a reminder. \u00a0In particular, the message I posted about it being the last day to donate really drove people to give.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>At the start of my campaign --</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>Want to know what you can get me for my birthday or Christmas? A malaria-free world!</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>http://birthday.causevox.com/peter-hurford</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I thought about what I wanted for my birthday, and I realized it was stupid just how much I've already gotten everything I've wanted out of life. There's not anything I could want that I couldn't just buy myself in a moment's notice. But there are children who are sick from malaria and can't afford the treatment needed to become healthy. Besides being a health issue, malaria is the single greatest drag on Africa\u2019s economy. The solution is surprisingly easy: a simple net will do the trick.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>For just $10, you can buy 3 nets that protect two people for ten years each. This is an amazing buy in healthcare, and has been backed as one of the best \"bangs for your buck\" in charity by independent charity evaluators such as GiveWell and the United Nations.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>And it gets better -- thanks to an anonymous benefactor, every dollar you give will be doubled! Take your chance to double your impact!</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>This is an issue I care passionately about, and I thank you for your support! The families will thank you too.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Six days before the end of the campaign, on my birthday --</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>I've been really delighted to use my birthday to protect people in the developing world from malaria. I've been overwhelmed by the support so far, raising over $3000 (!!!) for a good cause.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>$10 is all it takes to buy three bed nets -- nets that a family sleeps under to prevents mosquitoes from getting to them, stopping them from getting malaria (since malaria-carrying mosquitoes only strike at night).</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Not only is it an amazing cause -- backed as one of the best \"bangs for your buck\" in charity by the United Nations -- but every donation made so far is being *doubled* by an anonymous supporter.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I can't keep the fundraiser open forever -- eventually we'll need to use the funds. But I am keeping it open until 17 December. If you want to donate, you can find my fundraiser here: http://birthday.causevox.com/peter-hurford</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Together, we can help end malaria!</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Right before the end of the campaign --</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>My birthday fundraiser just finally reached it's 4000th dollar in donations. Wow! I'm really excited for all the support you guys have pitched in. Dozens of individual donations!</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Of course, $4000 still doesn't mean malaria control is fully funded. The cause is still as important as ever. My fundraiser is still open for ten more hours, so if you wanted to contribute, and get your donation matched dollar-for-dollar, now's your final chance!</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Remember $10 is all it takes to buy three bed nets -- nets that a family sleeps under to prevents mosquitoes from getting to them, stopping them from getting malaria. One of the most cost-effective interventions you can fund.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>If you want to donate, you can find my fundraiser here: http://birthday.causevox.com/peter-hurford. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Ten hours remain!</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>The day after the campaign --</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>Thanks everyone who was involved with my birthday for charity fundraiser! Together we raised precisely $5000 Canadian dollars ($4309 in freedom dollars) -- a nice round number, and enough to fund over 1500 bed nets to protect people from malaria.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Woohoo!</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Note many of the techniques mentioned earlier, plus (I) mentioning the donation totals so as to invoke [social proof] and (J) adding in urgency.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>(Also, thanks to Jess Whittlestone for </span><a href=\"http://www.cafe.com/charity/today-is-giving-tuesday-so-where-should-you-give?u=d98f7e49-856f-4d64-8d9d-ef53727c1d5a\"><span>unwittingly giving me the language</span></a><span> to use in my first FB post appeal and on my actual campaign page.)</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>TIP #8: Give your fundraiser some time, but not too much time</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>I think it would have been smart to do the week before my birthday and the week after. \u00a0I think I started a bit too early. \u00a0People need some time to donate and you need some time to get all the messages out, so make sure there's time for both. \u00a0But people respond well to the urgency of the campaign ending.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>TIP #9: Don\u2019t worry too much about your fundraising target, but have a strategy.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>What should you set your fundraising goal to be? \u00a0The simple question is to think about how much you can raise, and set it to that. \u00a0(Well, with donation matching, multiply it by two.)</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>People like goals that are high, but within reach. \u00a0I personally thought that raising $500 was well within my reach (as several others had done it), so I made my initial goal $1K.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>One thing I was worried about was that I knew of a few people I thought had a chance of donating several hundred dollars, and I didn\u2019t want them to see a goal with only $50 to go and then donate only $50 as they think I wouldn\u2019t be able to accept more money than that. \u00a0So I tried to keep my goal about $500 above my total raised at all times, until the very last day.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>TIP #10: Think about who else might share your fundraiser</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>To be honest, I didn't really think this tip through as much as I should have. \u00a0Toward the end of my campaign, my girlfriend shared it on her FB wall, which led to some additional donations. \u00a0This could have potentially been a lot bigger had I got her involved earlier. \u00a0It also may have been good to consider who else would agree to spread my campaign but would be unwilling to do a campaign of their own.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>TIP #11: You will mess up. \u00a0And that's ok.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>There were times when I sent out typos, flubbed the personal introduction, and even flubbed the byline (saying \"Hey Patrick\" to Sally). \u00a0Needless to say, this is very embarrassing!</span></p>\n<p><span>This usually happened when I tried to get a bit too wild with copy/paste and Facebook's \"hit enter to send\" feature. \u00a0You can mitigate it by being more careful, but I'm pretty sure you can't eliminate it. \u00a0You'll just have to accept it. \u00a0The people I blundered on were pretty understanding when I immediately apologized and explained. \u00a0I don't think any of them ended up donating, but I don't think I harmed any friendships.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>TIP #12: Keep in contact with people in the off-season</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Again, the point of this is to make genuine connections and re-connections, not just to use your friends as a means to an end of fundraising. \u00a0It's important to keep in contact with your friends even when not fundraising. \u00a0I'm excited to use my fundraiser as a launching point to rekindle some old relationships, and I enjoyed having a few phone calls with old pals.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>TIP #13: Yes, there is an 80-20 to fundraising, but it's not everything.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>I raised $2505 prior to the matching funds. \u00a0$1000 of this (40%) came from two different people. \u00a0So, instead of spending 17 hours talking to everyone, why not spend 30 minutes talking to those two people and call it a day with a $2K after-match fundraiser?</span></p>\n<p><span>There certainly is a power law to fundraisers. \u00a0However, I don't think the big donors you know would act nearly as much if there aren't smaller donors as well.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Moreover, even if your FB friends aren't big donors, it's still worth contacting them. \u00a0When I take out these two outliers, each FB contact was still worth about $2 in expectation.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>If you\u2019re short on time, definitely do something rather than do everything. \u00a0$2K is still really good! \u00a0You can raise money with just a few FB status messages and a few personalized emails. \u00a0But if you\u2019re able to put the time into it, there\u2019s further benefit in it.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>TIP #14: Get matching funds.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Obviously $5010 is a lot cooler than $2505. \u00a0This was only possible through the matching donations that Charity Science provided me. \u00a0Donation matching also looks really good to the people you're raising money from because it shows social proof, it shows serious commitment, and people like having twice the impact.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>GiveWell says </span><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/15/why-you-shouldnt-let-donation-matching-affect-your-giving/\"><span>not to be affected by donation matching</span></a><span>, and I think this is generally good advice. \u00a0But there certainly is a good game played by helping Charity Science acquire matching funds. \u00a0The people currently giving matching funds to Charity Science probably would have donated less otherwise, if not for the compelling opportunity.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>TIP #15: Just do it.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>When given the opportunity, you definitely should run a fundraiser! \u00a0Don't get into the mindset that if you can't raise thousands of dollars, it's not worth it. \u00a0Even smaller-scale fundraisers are still probably one of the biggest charitable accomplishments you'll make!</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Birthday for Charity Pages:</span><span> </span><a

{"date": "16th Sep 2014", "title": "A Brief Summary of \"How to Raise Money Without Killing a Kitten\u201d", "author": "Peter_Hurford", "num_comments": "3 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Recently I was listening to the Freakonomics Podcast entitled <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/how-raise-money-without-killing-kitten/#.UrCFi2nlOws.pocket\">\"How to Raise Money Without Killing a Kitten\u201d</a>. \u00a0They interviewed economist John List about fundraising. \u00a0There were a fair bit of interesting tips about fundraising, so I took some notes in case anyone was interested. \u00a0This is essentially a \"brief summary of a brief summary\" as List was already summarizing his research.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why_People_Give\"><strong>Why People Give</strong></h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Altruism is not as a big of a deal as people think when it comes to motivating donations -- instead people are frequently driven by self-interest. \u00a0It\u2019s important to play into this. \u00a0Your fundraising should be somewhat about giving the donor the ability to brag about how good of a person they are at the Thanksgiving table, though it won\u2019t work if you\u2019re explicit about it. \u00a0The point is to create a \u201cwarm glow\u201d.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A lot of giving is due to social pressure. \u00a0For example, people will donate when confronted by a Brownie Scout, but will go out of their way to avoid a Brownie Scout in the first place so they don\u2019t \u201chave to\u201d donate.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A lot of giving is also due to herding. \u00a0People give where their friends give.</li>\n</ul>\n<div><br></div>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"How_to_Raise_More_Money\"><strong>How to Raise More Money</strong></h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There\u2019s a culture of tradition when it comes to fundraising advice, and not many people fundraise based on statistics.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>List believes a typical response rate for a good campaign to cold call people to ask for money is 1%. \u00a0Americans already give 2-2.5% of their income on average.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>People will give more if it\u2019s convenient. \u00a0If there were a button to donate during the podcast, a decent amount of people would do it, but virtually no-one will remember to go on their computer and donate after the podcast is over.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Attractiveness of the fundraiser is important in door-to-door fundraising. \u00a0Men give more to good-looking women, but women do not give more to good-looking men or women, nor do men give more to good-looking men (though I don\u2019t know if this study looked into gay men). \u00a0This effect is rather large \u2014- a woman rated a \u201c9\u201d in attractiveness raises twice as much on average as a woman rated a \u201c6\u201d.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The best way List found to motivate donations was to offer a lottery with a chance of winning something that is really desirable. \u00a0Every dollar someone gives or raises for the cause should give them one more shot to win. \u00a0This outperforms offering prizes for meeting certain donation levels, though it\u2019s unclear what the effect is of doing both. \u00a0Also, to offer a lottery one should check gambling laws. \u00a0Typically, an exception of no donation being necessary to enter will be legally required.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Matching funds are very useful at motivating donations. \u00a0Though keep in mind a 3:1 match offers the same benefit as a 1:1 match, so use those extra matching funds for something else.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If possible, emphasize what the donor will lose if fundraising isn\u2019t met, as loss aversion is powerful. \u00a0Though, this works better for local art museums than for donating to the third world. \u00a0On the flip-side, though, donations to the third world can more easily create warm glows than art museums, so the advantage is pretty even. \u00a0Also, keep in mind that loss aversion advertising can appear overly desparate if not done carefully.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>...Now go out there and raise more money. :)\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Next, <a href=\"/ea/cs/how_i_raised_501032_for_amf_and_how_you_can_too/\">I use these techniques and raise $5010.32...</a>)</p></div></div>"},

{"date": "30th Nov 2014", "title": "Spitballing EA career ideas", "author": "Ben_Kuhn", "num_comments": "33 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><div>\n<p><em>Cross-posted from <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/\">my blog</a>. I'd love to hear your thoughts or additional brainstorming of interesting careers!</em></p>\n<p>The standard way of thinking about using one\u2019s career for effective altruism focuses a lot on narrowing down what fields you\u2019re interested in. For instance, 80,000 Hours has a list of just four <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/top-careers/\">\u201ctop careers\u201d</a> and ten or so other second- or third-tier options.</p>\n<p>Thinking about specific fields is important, because some fields do contain more high-impact opportunities than others. But another important piece is the variation you\u2019ll see in the best opportunities available <em>within</em> each field. Factors of personal fit also mean that some people might not be well-suited to a lot of the current \u201cEA-approved\u201d careers.</p>\n<p>Because of this, I think it would be interesting to see some wider-ranging career thinking, considering more possible fields and more different types of skillsets. So I\u2019ve made a list of as many jobs as I could think of that sound potentially interesting from an EA perspective.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think all of these jobs necessarily contain high-impact opportunities, and probably most high-impact opportunities lie outside the fields on this list\u2014my only goal is to help get people started thinking more broadly and creatively about their altruistic impact.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.ruthiebyers.com/\">Ruthie</a> for suggesting many of these and reading a draft of this post.</em></p>\n<div><span>Contents</span> \n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#interesting-skillsets\">Interesting skillsets</a> \n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#product-management\">Product management</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#event-organizing\">Event organizing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#recruiting\">Recruiting</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#sales\">Sales</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#marketing\">Marketing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#promoting\">Promoting</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#influencing-money\">Influencing money</a> \n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#venture-capital\">Venture capital</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#grantmaking\">Grantmaking</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#wealth-management\">Wealth management</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#influencing-politics\">Influencing politics</a> \n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#lobbying\">Lobbying</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#regulation\">Regulation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#think-tank-work\">Think-tank work</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#influencing-people\">Influencing people</a> \n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#mainstream-career-advising\">Mainstream career advising</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#life-coaching\">Life coaching</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#religiouspseudo-religious-leadership\">Religious/pseudo-religious leadership</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#teaching\">Teaching</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#running-a-summer-camp-or-other-extracurricular\">Running a summer camp (or other extracurricular)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#writing\">Writing</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#generic-leverage\">Generic leverage</a> \n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#developing-world-entrepreneurship\">Developing-world entrepreneurship</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#data-science\">Data science</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#consulting-for-nonprofits\">Consulting for nonprofits</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#technology-in-academia\">Technology in academia</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#generally-solid-jobs\">Generally solid jobs</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"Interesting_skillsets\">Interesting skillsets</h2>\n<p>Lots of jobs seem worth exploring purely because they build interesting skills that are very different from the current demographics of the EA movement. This has a ton of benefits: it makes the movement more robust, adds diversity of thought and of capability, and set a good role model for prospective new aspiring EAs who aren\u2019t cut from the software-engineer/philosopher cloth. (Many of these apply to some extent to jobs in other categories as well, but especially strongly to jobs in this category.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"Product_management\">Product management</h3>\n<p>At tech companies, product managers are responsible for coordinating engineering efforts on a product\u2014making sure that the engineers respond to what users want, that they work on important features, that everyone is properly coordinated, etc. It\u2019s not necessarily a technical position, and it involves a lot of interesting work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Event_organizing\">Event organizing</h3>\n<p>The fact that I currently have any authority on the subject of organizing EA events should be enough to justify the inclusion of this skillset.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Recruiting\">Recruiting</h3>\n<p>A good recruiter\u2019s job is basically to build strong networks of awesome people. Given the current insularity and mediocre networking abilities of the EA movement (and most groups of people in general), it seems like an incredibly underrated skillset.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Sales\">Sales</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest cheap wins that Harvard Effective Altruism ever got was when I read something <a href=\"http://www.nickbeckstead.com/\">Nick Beckstead</a> wrote about doing sales and invented a new <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Giving-Games\">Giving Game</a> pitch based on it. You can read about it <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/embarrassed\">here</a>\u2014it practically quadrupled the number of email-list signups we got. The point is, HEA members had trouble even with basic sales moves like \u201cdon\u2019t be super awkward about it,\u201d and upping our game there was incredibly helpful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Marketing\">Marketing</h3>\n<p>I know of one marketer who hangs around the EA movement. He has <a href=\"http://a-nice-place-to-live.blogspot.com/\">one of the more interesting EA blogs</a>. He probably has a lot of other interesting things to say, but I don\u2019t really know because <em>I have no idea how marketing works</em>. I feel like this is probably true of a lot of this post\u2019s audience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Promoting\">Promoting</h3>\n<p>As a promoter, you basically get paid to make places look like attractive places to be. That seems like a pretty useful/generally cool skill. For instance, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity:_Water\">the guy who runs charity: water</a> was originally a club promoter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Influencing_money\">Influencing money</h2>\n<p>It\u2019s pretty obvious that jobs where one can influence a lot of money have the potential to do a lot of good.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Venture_capital\">Venture capital</h3>\n<p>A lot of venture capital seems to be deployed towards pretty dumb things and in a pretty dumb way. If you can shift some capital towards investments that are more likely to have a good impact on the world, you could potentially be responsible for a huge amount of impact. A thought leader in venture capital could do even more good by influencing what kind of companies people start even without investing in them.</p>\n<p>I haven\u2019t worked very closely with VCs, so I\u2019m not sure how easy it is to become influential in the field\u2014my impression is that since it\u2019s prestigious there are a lot of associates who basically don\u2019t have any input on investment decisions and just do a lot of grunt work. So it may be hard to break in. That said, it seems worth thinking about.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Grantmaking\">Grantmaking</h3>\n<p>A GiveWell conversation had this to observe about NIH grants:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Grant reviewers at NIH tend to fund similar projects year after year, and NIH\u2019s grant system is often biased toward those researchers who have become savvy about applying for funding through NIH. Moreover, since 1991, NIH\u2019s grant applications no longer require information about researchers\u2019 existing resources. Previously, it was possible to evaluate researchers\u2019 productivity as a factor of their funding, but now the researchers with the most existing funding appear to be the most productive and so are more likely to receive additional funding. A better mechanism is needed to remove biases in the grant system and reduce the size of some grants. A start has been made: a few NIH agencies, such as the National Cancer Institute (NCI), require an extra review when researchers being recommended for more funding already receive more than $1M a year from NIH.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u2014 <a href=\"http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Alberts%201-29-14%20(public).pdf\">source</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"Wealth_management\">Wealth management</h3>\n<p>Wealth management seems to have a similar problem to venture capital where a lot of the money is pretty dumb. (I\u2019m basing this on what I hear from Theorem\u2019s sales team talking to wealth managers.)</p>\n<p>The bad news is that this means that being smart probably isn\u2019t a big competitive edge. The good news is that if you <em>do</em> manage to compete successfully on whatever dimensions wealth managers compete on (connections? fancy clothes?), you can probably do much more interesting things with the money than other people do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Influencing_politics\">Influencing politics</h2>\n<p>Public policy is also a subject of some EA exploration, but I think people aren\u2019t aware of many careers outside <a href=\"/TODO\">elected party politics</a> which made it onto 80k\u2019s website. But policy is another great tool of leverage. This area seems under-explored compared to influencing money, probably again due to demographics of the EA movement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Lobbying\">Lobbying</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/mar/22/our-corrupt-politics-its-not-all-money/?pagination=false\">Lawrence Lessig on lobbying</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The lobbyist today is ethical, and well educated. He or she works extremely hard to live within the letter of the law. More than ever before, most lobbyists are just well-paid policy wonks, expert in a field and able to advise and guide Congress well. Regulation is complex; regulators understand very little; the lobbyist is the essential link between what the regulator wants to do and how it can get done\u2026. Most of it is decent, aboveboard, the sort of stuff we would hope happens inside the Beltway.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sign me up!</p>\n<h3 id=\"Regulation\">Regulation</h3>\n<p>Elected party politics is one way to get a lot of leverage, but non-elected officials also have considerable power to do altruistic good. This seems especially important in light of the huge problems with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture\">regulatory capture</a> in many agencies; it seems likely that you could do a lot of good simply by being a regulator who is more resistant to capture than most.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Think_tank_work\">Think-tank work</h3>\n<p>Lots of think tanks publish research that ends up being used in policy reform. My impression from <a href=\"http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Teles%206-12-13%20%28public%29.pdf\">this GiveWell conversation with Steve Teles</a> is that think tanks\u2019 research on any particular problem may be very effectiveness-driven, they don\u2019t often explicitly seek out high-leverage areas to do research in, so some EA-style priority-setting could be quite influential.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Influencing_people\">Influencing people</h2>\n<p>People are another leverage point that seems relatively neglected by the current EA movement compared to money or even policy influence. Here are some ideas in that department.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Mainstream_career_advising\">Mainstream career advising</h3>\n<p>I think that 80,000 Hours wants to get their career counselors into colleges at some point, but you don\u2019t have to wait for them to do this! Most colleges already have career-advising offices that might benefit from the EA perspective. (Caveat: I\u2019m not sure how much they give students substantial career advice compared to, e.g., resume proofreading; you\u2019d obviously want to look for positions that would be heavy on the former and light on the latter.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"Life_coaching\">Life coaching</h3>\n<p>My impression is that many people get interested in the effective altruism movement for similar reasons that people look for life coaching (wanting a sense of purpose/goals/motivation). So as a life coach you might have the chance to pique a lot of people\u2019s interest in effective altruism.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Religious_pseudo_religious_leadership\">Religious/pseudo-religious leadership</h3>\n<p>I suspect this is underrated right now because the EA community is fairly atheist-heavy, but Harvard Effective Altruism has always gotten a great response to EA ideas from religious service groups. Even for atheists you could become a pseudo-religious leader like <a href=\"http://harvardhumanist.org/greg-epstein/\">Greg Epstein</a>. Again, this is a natural place that could benefit from the EA perspective since people are already looking for ways to improve the world.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Teaching\">Teaching</h3>\n<p>Not very many teachers end up being huge influences on their students down the road, but the ones that do seem to influence lots of their students very strongly. Being this kind of teacher could result in a lot of kids being more interested in improving the world than they otherwise would be.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Running_a_summer_camp__or_other_extracurricular_\">Running a summer camp (or other extracurricular)</h3>\n<p>When I was young I was pretty strongly influenced by the summer camps I went to. This seems a lot like teaching, except lower-commitment and with more influence relative to the amount of time you spend doing it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Writing\">Writing</h3>\n<p>There are a number of examples here already: Peter Singer, Larissa MacFarquhar, Will MacAskill, Scott Alexander. Obviously it\u2019s very tough to be as influential as these folks, but the payoff is enormous. I know plenty of people who have gotten interested in effective altruism through essays like Scott\u2019s <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/\"><em>Efficient Charity: Do Unto Others\u2026</em></a>. In fact, I even know of a few people who got interested through my own blog\u2014so there may be good payoffs from writing even as a side thing and even if you\u2019re nowhere near the level of Scott Alexander.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Generic_leverage\">Generic leverage</h2>\n<p>There are a bunch of other things I thought of that give you a lot of altruistic leverage without fitting into one of the above categories. So, rounding out the list:</p>\n<h3 id=\"Developing_world_entrepreneurship\">Developing-world entrepreneurship</h3>\n<p>It\u2019s been <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w10433\">estimated</a> that American entrepreneurs capture on the order of 1% of the value they create. In the developing world, a dollar of social value is worth about 100 times as much as in the US (for instance, in the developing world a good program can achieve $5,000 per life saved, whereas in the US $500,000 per life saved would be extraordinary). A back-of-the-envelope calculation based on these ratios suggests that a startup in the US would have to be worth about 50 times as much to have the same impact as one in the developing world. This calculation is obviously not definitive, but it\u2019s suggestive that the idea of developing-world entrepreneurship has potential.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Data_science\">Data science</h3>\n<p>I stole this one wholesale from <a href=\"http://www.bayesimpact.org/\">Bayes Impact</a>. Basically, it seems like there are a lot of places where data science has the potential to do a lot of good but those improvements are hard to capture (government and healthcare leap out). Hence a motivated altruist could make a lot of improvements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Consulting_for_nonprofits\">Consulting for nonprofits</h3>\n<p>GiveWell has observed that many nonprofits don\u2019t keep careful enough track of the results of their programs to even know how well they\u2019re doing. And even for charities that do collect data, they can <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/saving-lives-for-seven-cents-each\">interpret the results in a bogus way</a>. Even if a charity\u2019s intervention isn\u2019t effective enough to compete with GiveWell\u2019s top charities, if you can make it more effective you can do a lot of good, especially if the charity is large.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Technology_in_academia\">Technology in academia</h3>\n<p>Hat tip to Dario Amodei for this one. My impression from talking to academics in e.g. biology is that this area is <em>seriously</em> under-resourced. Lots of research is held back by shoddy software but there aren\u2019t many people with the skills to fix it, and it\u2019s not sexy enough to attract the attention of many funders.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Generally_solid_jobs\">Generally solid jobs</h2>\n<p>There are a number of jobs that aren\u2019t as \u201csexy\u201d as typical EA picks (that is, they\u2019re not incredibly strong on any one dimension), but are generally solid, pay fairly well, aren\u2019t super competitive or difficult to break into, and have fairly robust demand.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m going off of fairly weak impressions when I list these, so I\u2019m just going to list them instead of writing paragraphs. But I think this category is worthy of a lot more consideration than it gets right now.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nursing</li>\n<li>Pharmacy</li>\n<li>Physical therapy</li>\n<li>Elder care</li>\n<li>Skilled trades</li>\n<li>Accounting</li>\n<li>Actuarial science</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div></div>"},
{"date": "16th Sep 2014", "title": "To Inspire People to Give, Be Public About Your Giving", "author": "Peter_Hurford", "num_comments": "13 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Many people think it would be nicer if people were to give more money to non-profits, especially effective ones. \u00a0However, for most people, it doesn't even occur to them that they giving a large share of their salary to charity is something that people actually can do, or\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org\">that people are doing on a regular basis</a>.</p>\n<p>Being public with one's pledge to donate not only spreads information about how easy it is to fight global poverty with a serious commitment, but that such commitments are the kind of thing that people can actually take. \u00a0By being public with these pledges, we can actually inspire people to give, where they otherwise wouldn't.</p>\n<p>But how did people get stuck in a rut? \u00a0Why doesn't giving money come naturally? \u00a0And how would public declarations help dig people out of this rut?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_Bystander_Effect_and_The_Assumption_of_Self_Interest\">The Bystander Effect and The Assumption of Self-Interest</h2>\n<p>First, to understand how to get people to give we have to understand why they currently do not. \u00a0There are\u00a0<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/e2n/why_dont_people_help_others_more/\">a number of reasons</a>, but one of the most prevalent is what's called the\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander%20Effect\">bystander effect</a>. \u00a0While this effect is widely known in groups failing to respond to disasters right in front of their faces, it's magnified when the disaster is global poverty a continent or two away. \u00a0We think that because other people around us are not giving, it must also not be our responsibility, and we sure wouldn't want to be suckered into helping when no one else is doing their fair share.</p>\n<p>Ever since Thomas Hobbes's\u00a0<strong>The Leviathan</strong>, seeing human nature in terms of selfishness has been common, and persists to this day[1,2] as a strong and occasionally self-reinforcing belief[3,4]. \u00a0People think of monetary incentives as being the most effective incentive for encouraging blood donations[5], even when this turns out to not be the case[6]. \u00a0People greatly over-estimate the amount people will support a policy that favors them over other people[5]. \u00a0As noted by Alexis de Tocqueville in 1835, \"Americans enjoy explaining almost every act of their lives on the principle of self-interest\"[7].</p>\n<p>This leads us to a natural assumption that donating to charity is irrational... or, at least, other people aren't doing it, so neither should I. \u00a0However, this norm of self-interest is largely a myth, and people seem to do better than most people expect.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Challenging_the_Self_Interest_Norm\">Challenging the Self-Interest Norm</h2>\n<p>This means the self-interest norm has to be challenged, and if it is challenged, we can expect people to revise their selfish-based theory of human nature and turn to more selfless acts like charitable giving. \u00a0If we're interested in getting people to donate more than what they already do, we need to open people up to the idea that charitable giving cannot only be virtuous but\u00a0<em>expected</em>, and can be done not only at the typical rate of 1%, but at rates of 10% or much higher[8]. \u00a0We also should challenge the norm that charity should be silent and not spoken about, and instead mention it openly and proudly[9].</p>\n<p>People tend to conform, both intentionally and unintentionally, adopting the actions of others[4], and end up unwilling to adopt contrary actions unless other people are also going along with them. \u00a0If peer pressure can make high schoolers turn to drug use, alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking, or even drop out of high school[10], surely it can stop people from giving.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For example, take the famous\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments\">Asch Conformity Experiments</a>. \u00a0Here, people were in a group and asked to look at a line and compare its length to three other lines on another card, and state which line matches the height of the first line. \u00a0The task is enormously simple, but is complicated by being in a group of several other people, all in on the experiment, all who give the identical wrong answer.</p>\n<p>Asch found that many people would conform to this wrong answer, even against their better judgement. \u00a0However, by adding another subject to this experiment who would give the correct answer, the tendency to conform would drop dramatically, even though the correct answer is still in the minority. \u00a0Take away the partner, even halfway through the experiment with the same subject, and conformity shoots back up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, allowing people an escape from this norm can lead them to be able to increase their charitable donations. \u00a0In one field experiment, a radio station would mention to potential donors whenever a previous donor had donated $300, and they found that this increased donations by $13 more per person over the control condition, and these donors were also more likely to renew their memberships and donate more the next year compared to those in the control condition[11].</p>\n<p>In a separate field experiment, donors gave more to a radio station when prompted with an amount that was higher than their previous contribution[12]. \u00a0Lastly, a third field experiment found that student donors were more likely to give to funds for students when told that 64% of other students had donated than when they were told that 46% of other students had donated[13].</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Overall, people are moved by seeing what others do, and can be tilted away from self-destructive norms by seeing other people go against the flow. \u00a0An organization like Giving What We Can making a public stand for giving can accomplish just that. \u00a0Make your giving public, and it should multiply as you inspire others.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Motivations_and_Fights_for_Status\">Motivations and Fights for Status</h2>\n<p>Reflecting on the need to push up the norm to accurately reflect the giving nature of society, it seems like the pushback to privatize giving is harmful. \u00a0And I think it is. \u00a0But why does it come about in the first place? \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/09/covert-virtue-the-signal-that-doesnt-bark.html\">Robert Wiblin speculates</a>\u00a0that being public about giving calls your motivations into question. \u00a0If you're only motivated by compassion for those in need, why do you need to boast?</p>\n<p>Well, of course, there's an interest in raising the norm. \u00a0But let's assume that giving was really just a giant fight for status... would that be so bad? \u00a0All else being equal, I prefer pure intention to that of giving just to prove to others, but competing for status via donation oneupmanship is\u00a0<em>considerably</em>\u00a0more useful than competing for status via bigger houses, bigger cars, and bigger flatscreen TVs.</p>\n<p>Or rather, people still end up competing over their charitable contributions, but it comes in the forms of significantly less-effective (though still arguably worthwhile) charitable competition, like\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2012-11-20\">volunteering</a>, building schools, or adopting African children. \u00a0If, instead, we normalized people giving checks, at least more people could be helped while the status fight goes on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Many people want to leave the world in a better place than they found it, perhaps even going as far as wanting to do the best they can. \u00a0To these people, I hope that the idea of donation, especially to\u00a0<a href=\"http://givewell.org/giving101\">effective causes</a>\u00a0in\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/make-money.html\">potentially large amounts</a>\u00a0ends up appealing. \u00a0But if this cool idea is seen as \"boastful\", it won't catch on, and won't get the publicity (I think) it deserves.</p>\n<p>Moreover, people won't be able to network together and share information about more cost-effective charities or the latest trends in development economics, because everyone will be keeping it to themselves, ending up being collectively self-defeating.</p>\n<p>We seem forced by society to pretend to be self-interested, because we're asked to not talk about our acts of kindness. \u00a0But this only goes to re-enforce the deadly cycle. \u00a0The only way to push ourselves out of this cycle is to demonstrate that some people do donate and push up this norm. \u00a0And groups like\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org\">GivingWhatWeCan</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.80000hours.org\">80000 Hours</a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.boldergiving.org/\">BolderGiving</a>\u00a0are working on doing just that.</p>\n<p>Personally, I'd have to agree that this works -- I'm inspired by these stories, and I don't think I would ever be donating 10%+ without a group that makes it seem like a completely normal and awesome thing to do.</p>\n<p>So is talking about donations too boastful? \u00a0I think, for the sake of those the donations help, we can afford a little boasting in this one area.</p>\n<p><strong

Conceivably, people with access to disaster shelters or other refuges may be more likely to survive and help civilization recover. However, existing disaster shelters (sometimes built to ensure continuity of government operations and sometimes built to protect individuals), people working on submarines, largely uncontacted peoples, and people living in very remote locations may serve this function to some extent.<p></p><p><b>What are the possible interventions?</b> Other interventions may also increase the chances that humanity would recover from a global catastrophe, but this review focuses on disaster shelters. Proposed methods of improving disaster shelter networks include stocking shelters with appropriately trained people and resources that would enable them to rebuild civilization in case of a near-extinction event, keeping some shelters constantly full of people, increasing food reserves, and building more shelters. A philanthropist could pay to improve existing shelter networks in the above ways, or they could advocate for private shelter builders or governments to make some of the improvements listed above.</p><p><b>Who else is working on it? </b>Some governments maintain bunkers in order to maintain continuity of government and/or to protect their citizens. Some individuals purchase and maintain private disaster shelters<b>.</b></p><p><b>Questions for further investigation: </b>With the possible exception of pandemic specifically engineered to kill all humans, I am aware of no scenario in which improved disaster shelters would plausibly enable a small group of people to survive a sudden near-extinction event. In the case of other catastrophes where a much larger number of people would survive, I would guess that improved refuges would play a relatively small role in helping humanity to recover because they would represent a small share of relevant people and resources. Many challenging questions about improving refuges remain, but I would prioritize investigating other issues at this point because refuges seem likely to be of limited value and alternative strategies (such as improving biosecurity and increasing the resilience of industrial and agricultural systems) seem more likely to effectively reduce the global catastrophic risks that improving refuges might plausibly address.\n</p><h2 id=\"Why_did_I_look_into_this_area_\">Why did I look into this area?</h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li>A number of different global catastrophes could conceivably result in the collapse of civilization.</li>\n\t<li>Although refuges would only prevent a tiny portion of the deaths that could follow a global catastrophe, they could conceivably help humanity to survive and recover in the long run.</li>\n\t<li>From some philosophical perspectives that highly value future generations,<a title=\"\" href=\"#_edn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> increased likelihood of eventual recovery from global catastrophes is extremely important.</li>\n\t<li>Robin Hanson<a href=\"#_edn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and Jason Matheny<a href=\"#_edn3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> have suggested that investing in refuges may increase the chances that humanity would recover from a global catastrophe.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Terminology\">Terminology</h2>\n\u201cBunker\u201d and \u201cshelter\u201d seem to be used largely interchangeably, but \u201cbunker\u201d is more often used to describe large shelters built by the government. Government buildings, including bunkers, designed to withstand severe stress are sometimes called \u201chardened facilities.\u201d Private shelter providers tend to use \u201cshelter\u201d to describe their products, and this document follows that usage when describing their products. In this document, \u201crefuge\u201d is used broadly to mean \u201cplace where people might be especially likely to survive a global catastrophe.\u201d\n<h2 id=\"What_is_the_problem_\">What is the problem?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"How_could_refuges_help_civilization_recover_from_a_global_catastrophe_\">How could refuges help civilization recover from a global catastrophe?</h3>\nAbstractly speaking, a global catastrophe could leave the remaining population just below some threshold\u2014in terms of numbers, supplies, or capabilities\u2014necessary for humanity to eventually recover. In such a case, had there been an appropriate network of disaster shelters or other refuges, humanity might have recovered. For example:\n<ol>\n\t<li><b>Disaster shelters could help a small population to survive some initial catastrophe.</b> A nuclear war would be unlikely to kill everyone outright,<a href=\"#_edn4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> but perhaps some other catastrophe\u2014such as an engineered pandemic of the future\u2014could.\u00a0 Conceivably, an adequate disaster shelter might help a small population to survive and eventually rebuild civilization. The shelter would have to be stocked with enough supplies to wait out the catastrophe (e.g. to wait for radiation to clear).</li>\n\t<li><b>Perhaps a sufficiently large catastrophe would dramatically change the mixes of capital and labor that are useful, and disaster shelters or other refuges stocked with resources and people with appropriate skills would aid in recovery.</b><a href=\"#_edn5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a></li>\n</ol>\nDisaster shelters would not help given some conceivable catastrophe scenarios, such as unfriendly AI<a href=\"#_edn6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> or global ecophagy from nanotechnology.<a href=\"#_edn7\"><sup>[7]</sup></a>\n<h3 id=\"What_kind_of_disaster_shelters_and_other_refuges_do_we_have_now_\">What kind of disaster shelters and other refuges do we have now?</h3>\n<h4 id=\"Government_bunkers_for_private_citizens\">Government bunkers for private citizens</h4>\nAs of 1986, the reference Nuclear War Survival Skills judged that, \u201cSwitzerland has the best civil defense system, one that already includes blast shelters for over 85 percent of all its citizens.\u201d They have 300,000 communal bunkers, which another source claims is enough for the entire Swiss population of 7.6 million, with a million spaces to spare.<a href=\"#_edn8\"><sup>[8]</sup></a> These bunkers are stocked with 4.5 months of food and basic fuel.<a href=\"#_edn9\"><sup>[9]</sup></a> In addition, a 1978 law requires all residential buildings to have a fallout shelter capable of withstanding a 12-megaton explosion at a distance of 700 meters or pay a fee. However, people building single-family homes typically pay the fee instead of building the shelters.<a href=\"#_edn10\"><sup>[10]</sup></a>\n<h4 id=\"Continuity_of_government_bunkers\">Continuity of government bunkers</h4>\nA <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_of_government\">Wikipedia page</a> describes continuity of government bunkers in Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United Sates, but without references.<a href=\"#_edn11\"><sup>[11]</sup></a> Some brief details on the capabilities of continuity of government bunkers are provided below (with references) for the US, the UK, and Russia.\n<h5>United States</h5>\nDuring the Cold War, the US government spent billions of dollars to build a network of bunkers designed to preserve continuity of government in the event of a nuclear strike against the US, the full extent of which is still unknown.<a href=\"#_edn12\"><sup>[12]</sup></a><p></p><p>Much information about continuity of government bunkers is classified\u2014one report suggests that even members of Congress can\u2019t get the full details of the plan<a href=\"#_edn13\"><sup>[13]</sup></a>\u2014and this makes it difficult to know much about their current capabilities.</p><p>Some known continuity of government bunkers include Cheyenne Mountain, Mount Weather,<a href=\"#_edn14\"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Raven Rock (also known as \u201cSite R\u201d),<a href=\"#_edn15\"><sup>[15]</sup></a> and U.S. Strategic Command. Additional bunkers are rumored to exist underneath the White House and at the Camp David Presidential retreat in Maryland.<a href=\"#_edn16\"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p><p>Project Greek Island was a top secret bunker, built underneath the Greenbrier resort in Western Virginia, that would be used to house members of Congress in the event of a nuclear strike. It was exposed by a journalist in 1993 and is no longer in operation.<a href=\"#_edn17\"><sup>[17]</sup></a> This suggests the possibility of other bunkers that might be off of the public record.</p><p>One concern about the effectiveness of these bunkers is that if people were notified that nuclear missiles were en route to the US, there may not be enough time for people to get inside of the bunkers.<a href=\"#_edn18\"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Another possible concern is that they would not have an appropriate gender mix to repopulate civilization. Mount Weather was initially built as an all-male facility.<a href=\"#_edn19\"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p><p>Historically, continuity of government bunkers were built primarily with nuclear war in mind, but people managing these bunkers have begun to consider threats like pandemic influenza.<a href=\"#_edn20\"><sup>[20]</sup></a>\n</p><h5>United Kingdom</h5>\nThe following is an excerpt from notes from a conversation with Nick McCamley, author of <i>Cold War Secret Nuclear Bunkers</i>:<p></p><p>\u201cThe UK created many bunkers during and before the Cold War, but they were decommissioned and sold off from 1998 to 2004. The bunkers kept three months of food at their peak. The UK government believed that in the event of a nuclear war, most of the population would perish, but a substantial portion would survive. McCamley believes the UK now uses many dispersed, mobile communication centers instead of bunkers. McCamley believes the UK would be very underprepared if there were a nuclear war today, and is much less prepared than Switzerland, which has fallout shelters for the entire population.\u201d<a href=\"#_edn21\"><sup>[21]</sup></a>\n</p><h5>Russia</h5>\nIn the late 1970s, Russia began working on a massive underground shelter at Yamantau Mountain.<a href=\"#_edn22\"><sup>[22]</sup></a>\n<h4 id=\"Shelters_purchased_by_private_citizens\">Shelters purchased by private citizens</h4>\nAs of 2010, Radius Engineering\u2014a private shelter provider\u2014had built 1100 shelters, about a third of which were in the Washington D.C. Area.<a href=\"#_edn23\"><sup>[23]</sup></a> Radius Engineering estimates that 10,000 people on three continents have access to their shelters.<a href=\"#_edn24\"><sup>[24]</sup></a> Radius Engineering describes the capability of their shelters as follows:<p></p><p>\u201cRadius underground WMD shelters are totally self-contained structural C3 Composite high pressure structures designed to protect 8-200 adults for 6 months to 5 years. Multiple shelters can be connected into underground communities. The shelters are specifically designed and developed to protect people during and after disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, firestorms, power failures, nuclear &amp; chemical accidents, nuclear, biological, &amp; chemical terrorism, and full-scale protracted nuclear, chemical and biological war and severe HEMP attacks\u2026.Radius shelters are used throughout the world to protect people for Business Contingency Plans (BCP\u2019s) in military, medical, corporate markets and Family Contingency Plans (FCP) for families.\u201d<a href=\"#_edn25\"><sup>[25]</sup></a></p><p>As of November 2012, Vivos had received about 25,000 applications for 6,000 planned spaces, and three facilities\u2014each designed to hold 1,000 people\u2014were being constructed.<a href=\"#_edn26\"><sup>[26]</sup></a> One shelter, located in Indiana, has been completed.<a href=\"#_edn27\"><sup>[27]</sup></a> Vivos shelters will include one year of food reserves<a href=\"#_edn28\"><sup>[28]</sup></a> and a Cryovault carrying sperm and eggs in hopes of helping to repopulate the earth in the event of a global catastrophe.<a href=\"#_edn29\"><sup>[29]</sup></a>\n</p><h4 id=\"Submarines\">Submarines</h4>\nPeople serving on submarines might be in a good position to survive many global catastrophes.<a href=\"#_edn30\"><sup>[30]</sup></a> US nuclear submarine crews typically have over 100 people,<a href=\"#_edn31\"><sup>[31]</sup></a> and can stay underwater for more than 90 days.<a href=\"#_edn32\"><sup>[32]</sup></a> According to Wikipedia, there are 398 attack subs in service worldwide, with 58 of them in the United States.<a href=\"#_edn33\"><sup>[33]</sup></a><p></p><p>There is a question of whether submarines have an appropriate gender mix to repopulate civilization.

These societies may be relatively safe from diseases which are easier to transfer in a highly interconnected world, and they know how to survive without reliance on modern technology and infrastructure. I would guess that it would be very challenging for a global catastrophe\u2014at least the kind which could be mitigated by constructing refuges\u2014to kill all of these people at once.\n</p><h2 id=\"What_are_the_possible_interventions_\">What are the possible interventions?</h2>\nOne proposed way of improving shelters is to stock them with appropriately trained people and resources that would enable them to rebuild civilization in case of a near-extinction event.<a href=\"#_edn38\"><sup>[38]</sup></a> For example, someone could ensure that some people trained in agriculture had ready access to large stockpiles of agricultural equipment that would be functional without a large industrial infrastructure, and that these people had access to good refuges. Alternatively, people might explicitly be trained to rebuild civilization following a catastrophe. Subsistence farmers and hunter-gatherers in largely uncontacted societies, survivalists, and \u201cpeople interested in \u201cliving off the grid\u201d<a href=\"#_edn39\"><sup>[39]</sup></a> may serve these functions to some extent already.<p></p><p>Another proposed way of improving shelters is to keep some of them constantly full of people.<a href=\"#_edn40\"><sup>[40]</sup></a> More generally, decreasing the amount of time it takes for people to get into their refuges might decrease the number of people affected by an initial catastrophe. The initial effects of a nuclear war would not kill everyone (as mentioned above), but it\u2019s conceivable that people in a refuge would avoid being infected by an extremely deadly pathogen that affected the rest of the world. However, sailors in submarines and people living in remote locations\u2014especially largely uncontacted peoples\u2014serve this purpose to some extent already.</p><p>However, with the possible exception of pandemic specifically engineered to kill all humans, I am aware of no scenario in which a refuge would plausibly enable a small group of people to survive a rapid near-extinction event. I have seen the following plausible-enough-to-discuss swift extinction scenarios discussed in print: alien invasion, AI, asteroids and comets, cosmic rays, gamma-ray bursts, global ecophagy from nanotechnology, nuclear war, pandemics (natural and manmade), physics disasters, simulation shutdown, supernovae, and supervolcanoes.<a href=\"#_edn41\"><sup>[41]</sup></a>\u00a0Refuges would clearly be of limited value in cases of alien invasion, AI, global ecophagy from nanotechnology, physics disasters, and simulation shutdowns. Asteroids and comets, nuclear wars, and supervoIcanoes are not \u201cswift\u201d extinction scenarios in my sense, and operate primarily by disrupting the global food supply. These scenarios are discussed in the next paragraph. I know very little about cosmic rays, gamma-ray bursts, and supernovae, but I doubt that both (a) they could kill everyone relatively quickly and (b) bunkers could help a small group survive in those cases.\u00a0That leaves pandemics. Natural pandemics seem extremely unlikely to kill all humans. Conceivably, a pathogen specifically engineered to kill all humans could do so. It therefore seems to me that the most plausible scenario in which a refuge prevents a swift human extinction is one in which only people in constantly-staffed refuges survive a pandemic purposely engineered (with futuristic technology) to cause human extinction.</p><p>It might be suggested that stocking refuges with a very large food supply\u2014over and above what is necessary to survive the initial catastrophe\u2014might help a small group to survive and recover if a global catastrophe disrupts global food production. A global catastrophe could disrupt global food production for two reasons. First, some global catastrophes\u2014such as supervolcanic eruptions, nuclear wars, and asteroid collisions\u2014might put enough dust in the atmosphere to interfere with photosynthesis and disrupt global food production. Second, the initial catastrophe could kill enough people and do enough damage to infrastructure to shut down global food production. However, I would guess that such additional food stockpiles in refuges would do little to increase chances of eventual recovery. In either case, there would be a substantial amount of remaining food reserves in the form of grain stockpiles, livestock, fisheries, foods stored at retailers and private homes, and wild land animals that could be hunted.<a href=\"#_edn42\"><sup>[42]</sup></a> Because of this, I would guess that any food stored in a refuge would be a relatively small part of the available food supply. If there were very few survivors, there would probably be a large amount of long-lasting food concentrated in small areas, e.g. in grain silos. If there were many survivors, it might be suggested that a refuge could, in some scenarios, help induce a less equal distribution of food, allowing at least a small group of people to survive. However, other places, e.g. grain silos, would hold more food than refuges, and many pressures for or against an egalitarian distribution would apply roughly equally to people holding food in refuges and people holding food in other existing stockpiles. I therefore see limited advantages in having refuges store food in excess of what would be required to survive an initial catastrophe. A counterpoint is that if a refuge is sufficiently isolated and/or secret, it would be easier to ensure that everyone in the refuge had an adequate food supply, even if that meant an inegalitarian food distribution.</p><p>Finally, we could build more shelters. Vivos\u2019 shelters cost between $6 million and $20 million each, and (as mentioned above) will hold 1000 people each.<a href=\"#_edn43\"><sup>[43]</sup></a> They sell spaces in their shelters for $50,000 each.

I would guess that, in the former case, resources and people stocked in refuges would play a relatively small role in helping humanity to recover because they would represent a small share of relevant people and resources. The latter case strikes me as relatively far-fetched and I would guess it would be very challenging to do much better than the largely uncontacted peoples in terms of ensuring the survival of the species. I would also guess that more targeted biosecurity efforts would more effectively reduce the risk of extinction from an engineered pandemic, and would have more substantial benefits in helping to prevent less extreme (and much less unlikely) pandemics.\u00a0 I would also guess that other measures aimed at increasing the resilience of industrial and agricultural systems to global catastrophes would be more effective than training a small number of people to rebuild civilization. I would therefore prioritize investigating other areas over further research into disaster shelters and other refuges.<p></p><p>If someone did look into disaster shelters and other refuges further, some questions to focus on would include:\n</p><ol>\n\t<li>Is it possible for a pathogen to literally kill everyone (except for the people in a refuge)? How could this happen?</li>\n\t<li>In what scenarios, if any, would it be useful for refuges to carry food supplies longer than one year? How likely are these scenarios?</li>\n\t<li>What other kinds of resources would it be valuable for refuges to stockpile in order to aid survivors in rebuilding civilization in the event of a global catastrophe? To what extent do they stock these resources now? To what extent are these resources unintentionally stockpiled in e.g. Wal-Mart distribution centers or warehouses?</li>\n\t<li>Apart from people working on submarines and living in remote locations, what other unintentional refuges are there?</li>\n\t<li>What are the capabilities of government shelters still in use in countries other than the US, the UK, and Switzerland?</li>\n\t<li>Would additional training help survivors to rebuild civilization? To what extent do survivalists and people trying to live \u201coff the grid\u201d already achieve these gains?</li>\n\t<li>How many survivors are necessary to rebuild civilization?</li>\n\t<li>How much would it cost to give a minimum viable population access to a refuge that was substantially better than all existing refuges?</li>\n\t<li>How beneficial would it be to increase the number of people with access to the best kind of refuges currently available?</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"My_process\">My process</h2>\nI decided to do this research in consultation with GiveWell staff, and GiveWell paid me for my time on this project.

From a long-run perspective, there is an enormous difference between a collapse of civilization followed by eventual recovery, versus a permanent collapse of civilization.\u201d Beckstead and Shulman 2013.</p><p>\u201cI believe that if we destroy mankind, as we now could, this outcome would be much worse than most people think. Compare three outcomes:\n</p><ol>\n\t<li>Peace.</li>\n\t<li>A nuclear war that kills 99% of the world\u2019s existing population.</li>\n\t<li>A nuclear war that kills 100%.</li>\n</ol>\n(2) would be worse than (1), and (3) would be worse than (2). Which is the greater of these two differences? Most people believe that the greater difference is between (1) and (2). I believe that the difference between (2) and (3) is very much greater.<p></p><p>. . . The Earth will remain inhabitable for at least another billion years. Civilization began only a few thousand years ago. If we do not destroy mankind, these few thousand years may be only a tiny fraction of the whole of civilized human history. The difference between (2) and (3) may thus be the difference between this tiny fraction and all of the rest of this history. If we compare this possible history to a day, what has occurred so far is only a fraction of a second.\u201d Parfit 1984, Pgs 453-454.</p><p></p></div>\n<div><p></p><p><span>[2]</span> \u201c\u2026there may be types of disasters where variations in resistance abilities can be important. If so, there might be a substantial chance of finding a post-disaster population that is just above, or just below, a threshold for preserving humanity. In this case it is reasonable to wonder what we might do now to change the odds. The most obvious possibility would be to create refuges with sufficient resources to help preserve a small group of people through a very large disruption, the resulting social collapse, and a transition period to a post-disaster society.\u201d Hanson, Robin 2008, Pg 373.</p><p></p></div>\n<div><p></p><p><span>[3]</span> \u201cPerhaps more cost effective than building refuges in space would be building them on Earth. Elaborate bunkers exist for government leaders to occupy during a nuclear war (McCamley, 2007). And remote facilities are planned to protect crop seeds from \u201cnuclear war, asteroid strikes, and climate change\u201d (Hopkin, 2007). But I know of no self-sufficient, remote, permanently occupied refuge meant to protect humanity from a range of possible extinction events. Hanson (2007) argues that a refuge permanently housing as few as 100 people would significantly improve the chances of human survival during a range of global catastrophes. The Americas and Polynesia were originally populated by fewer than 100 founders (Hey, 2005; Murray-McIntosh et al., 1998). Although it would take thousands of years for 100 people to repopulate Earth, this would be a small setback compared to extinction.\u201d Matheny 2007, Pg 1337.</p><p></p></div>\n<div><p></p><p><span>[4]</span> \u201cA 1979 study by the United States Office of Technology Assessment, \"<a href=\"http://ota.fas.org/reports/7906.pdf\">The Effects of Nuclear War</a>,\" considered direct casualties from the destruction of cities, as well as societal disruption from blasts (leaving out nuclear winter). For \"case 4\" an all-out nuclear exchange, estimates of casualties in the first 30 days ranged (depending on assumptions about sheltering, population distribution, and targeting) from 35% to 77% of the U.S. population and 20% to 40% of the Soviet population, reaching as much as 90% of the population if attacks were optimized to maximize civilian casualties at the expense of other objectives.\u201d\u00a0Shulman 2013</p><p></p></div>\n<div><p></p><p><span>[5]</span> \u201cIt is important to realize that a society rebuilding after a near-extinction crisis would have a vastly smaller sale than our current society; very different types and mixes of capital would be appropriate. Stocking a sanctuary full of the sorts of capital that we find valuable today could be even less useful than the inappropriate medicine, books, or computers often given by first world charities to the third world poor today. Machines would quickly fall into disrepair, and books would impart knowledge that had little practical application.</p><p>Instead, one must accept that a very small human population would mostly have to retrace the growth path of our human ancestors; one hundred people cannot support an industrial society today, and perhaps not even a farming society. They might have to start with hunting and gathering, until they could reach a scale where simple farming was feasible. And only when their farming population was large and dense enough could they consider returning to industry.</p><p>So it might make sense to stock a refuge with real hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers, together with the tools they find useful.\u201d Hanson 2008, Pgs 374-375.</p><p></p></div>\n<div><p></p><p><span>[6]</span> Muehlhauser and Salamon 2012.</p><p></p></div>\n<div><p></p><p><span>[7]</span> Freitas 2000.</p><p></p></div>\n<div><p></p><p><span>[8]</span> \u201c\u2026Switzerland has more than 300,000 bunkers, enough to shelter all 7.6 million Swiss with one million places to spare.\u201d</p><p>Wall Street Journal on Swiss fallout shelters.</p><p></p></div>\n<div><p></p><p><span>[9]</span> \u201cSome also hold the week's supply of food that the government urges the Swiss to stockpile.</p><p>\"They should correspond to family preferences and eating habits,\" advises a government pamphlet that includes a list of suggested shelter foods\u2014including not only canned goods and water but also pet food, chocolate, sausages and hard cheeses.

Fearing a decapitating strike, the Soviets sent tens of thousands of workers to these remote sites, where U.S. spy satellites spotted them still toiling away in the late 1990s. Yamantau is expected to be operating soon. According to diagrams and notes given to me in the late 1990s by SAC senior officers, the Yamantau command center is inside a rock quartz mountain, about 3,000 feet straight down from the summit. It is a wartime relocation facility for the top Russian political leadership. It is more a shelter than a command post, because the facility's communications links are relatively fragile. As it turned out, the quartz interferes with radio signals broadcast from inside the mountain.

Under some not-too-implausible assumptions, the result can be that almost all minds like ours are simulated minds, and that we should therefore assign a significant probability to being such computer-emulated minds rather than the (subjectively indistinguishable) minds of originally evolved creatures. And if we are, we suffer the risk that the simulation may be shut down at any time.

{"date": "9th Sep 2014", "title": "All Animals Are Equal", "author": "Introduction", "num_comments": "4 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span><em>by Peter Singer, excerpted from\u00a0All Animals Are Equal, the first chapter of Animal Liberation</em>, third edition</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/La6Zs4d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When we say that all human beings, whatever their race, creed, or sex, are equal, what is it that we are asserting? Those who wish to defend hierarchical, inegalitarian societies have often pointed out that by whatever test we choose it simply is not true that all humans are equal. Like it or not we must face the fact that humans come in different shapes and sizes; they come with different moral capacities, different intellectual abilities, different amounts of benevolent feeling and sensitivity to the needs of others, different abilities to communicate effectively, and different capacities to experience pleasure and pain. In short, if the demand for equality were based on the actual equality of all human beings, we would have to stop demanding equality. Still, one might cling to the view that the demand for equality among human beings is based on the actual equality of the different races and sexes.</p>\n<p>However, there is no need to pin the case for equality to one particular outcome of a scientific investigation. The appropriate response to those who claim to have found evidence of genetically based differences in ability among the races or between the sexes is not to stick to the belief that the genetic explanation must be wrong, whatever evidence to the contrary may turn up; instead we should make it quite clear that the claim to equality does not depend on intelligence, moral capacity, physical strength, or similar matters of fact. Equality is a moral idea, not an assertion of fact. There is no logically compelling reason for assuming that a factual difference in ability between two people justifies any difference in the amount of consideration we give to their needs and interests. The principle of the equality of human beings is not a description of an alleged actual equality among humans: it is a prescription of how we should treat human beings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jeremy Bentham, the founder of the reforming utilitarian school of moral philosophy, incorporated the essential basis of moral equality into his system of ethics by means of the formula: \"Each to count for one and none for more than one.\" In other words, the interests of every being affected by an action are to be taken into account and given the same weight as the like interests of any other being...\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is an implication of this principle of equality that our concern for others and our readiness to consider their interests ought not to depend on what they are like or on what abilities they may possess. Precisely what our concern or consideration requires us to do may vary according to the characteristics of those affected by what we do: concern for the well-being of children growing up in America would require that we teach them to read; concern for the well-being of pigs may require no more than that we leave them with other pigs in a place where there is adequate food and room to run freely. But the basic element-the taking into account of the interests of the being, whatever those interests may be-must, according to the principle of equality, be extended to all beings, black or white, masculine or feminine, human or nonhuman.</p>\n<p>Thomas Jefferson, who was responsible for writing the principle of the equality of men into the American Declaration of Independence, saw this point. It led him to oppose slavery even though he was unable to free himself fully from his slaveholding background. He wrote in a letter to the author of a book that emphasized the notable intellectual achievements of Negroes in order to refute the then common view that they had limited intellectual capacities:</p>\n<p>\u201cBe assured that no person living wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a complete refutation of the doubts I myself have entertained and expressed on the grade of understanding allotted to them by nature, and to find that they are on a par with ourselves... but whatever be their degree of talent it is no measure of their rights. Because Sir Isaac Newton was superior to others in understanding, he was not therefore lord of the property or persons of others.\u201d</p>\n<p>It is on this basis that the case against racism and the case against sexism must both ultimately rest; and it is in accordance with this principle that the attitude that we may call \"speciesism,\" by analogy with racism, must also be condemned. If possessing a higher degree of intelligence does not entitle one human to use another for his or her own ends, how can it entitle humans to exploit nonhumans for the same purpose? \u00a0</p>\n<p>It may be objected that comparisons of the sufferings of different species are impossible to make and that for this reason when the interests of animals and humans clash the principle of equality gives no guidance. It is probably true that comparisons of suffering between members of different species cannot be made precisely, but precision is not essential. Even if we were to prevent the infliction of suffering on animals only when it is quite certain that the interests of humans will not be affected to anything like the extent that animals are affected, we would be forced to make radical changes in our treatment of animals that would involve our diet, the farming methods we use, experimental procedures in many fields of science, our approach to wildlife and to hunting, trapping and the wearing of furs, and areas of entertainment like circuses, rodeos, and zoos. As a result, a vast amount of suffering would be avoided.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Part of\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/\">Introduction to Effective Altruism</a></p>\n<p>Previous:\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/50/preventing_human_extinction/\">Preventing Human Extinction</a>\u00a0\u2022 Next:\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/4k/four_focus_areas_of_effective_altruism/\">Four Focus Areas of Effective Altruism</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/ea/4k/four_focus_areas_of_effective_altruism/\"></a></p></div></div>"},

Requiring liability insurance for dual-use research", "author": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt", "num_comments": "19 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Hi all,</p>\n<p>I thought people might be interested in some of the policy work the Global Priorities Project has been looking into. Below I'm <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/liability-insurance/\">cross-posting some notes</a> on one policy idea. I've talked to several people with expertise in biosafety and had positive feedback, and am currently looking into how best to push further on this (it will involve talking to people in the insurance industry).</p>\n<p>In general quite a bit of policy is designed by technocrats and already quite effective. Some other areas are governed by public opinion which makes it very hard to have any traction. When we've looked into policy, we've been interested in finding areas which navigate between these extremes -- and also don't sound too outlandish, so that they have some reasonable chance of broad support.</p>\n<p>I'd be interested in hearing feedback on this from EAs. Criticisms and suggestions also very much welcome!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<h2 id=\"Requiring_liability_insurance_for_dual_use_research_with_potentially_catastrophic_consequences\">Requiring liability insurance for dual-use research with potentially catastrophic consequences</h2>\n<p><em>These are notes on a policy proposal aimed at reducing catastrophic risk. They cover some of the advantages and disadvantages of the idea at a general level; they do not yet constitute a proposal for a specific version of the policy.</em></p>\n<p><em></em> Research produces large benefits. In some cases it may also pose novel risks, for instance work on\u00a0potential pandemic pathogens. There is widespread agreement that such 'dual use research of concern' poses challenges for regulation.</p>\n<p>There is a convincing case that we should avoid research with large risks if we can obtain the benefits just as effectively with safer approaches. However, there do not currently exist natural mechanisms to enforce such decisions. Government analysis of the risk of different branches of research is a possible mechanism, but it must be performed anew for each risk area, and may be open to political distortion and accusations of bias.</p>\n<p>We propose that all laboratories performing dual-use research with potentially catastrophic consequences should be required by law to hold insurance against damaging consequences of their research.</p>\n<p>This market-based approach would force researcher institutions to internalise some of the externalities and thereby:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Encourage university departments and private laboratories to work on safer research, when the benefits are similar;</li>\n<li>Incentivise the insurance industry to produce accurate assessments of the risks;</li>\n<li>Incentivise scientists and engineers to and devise effective safety protocols that could be adopted by research institutions to reduce their insurance premiums.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Current safety records do not always reflect an appropriate level of risk tolerance. For example, the economic damage caused by the escape of the foot and mouth virus from a BSL-3 or BSL-4 lab in Britain in 2007 was high (mostly through trade barriers) and could have been much higher (the previous outbreak in 2001 caused \u00a38 billion of damage). If the lab had known they were liable for some of these costs, they might have taken even more stringent safety precautions. In the case of potential pandemic pathogen research, insurers might require it to take place in BSL-4 or to implement other technical safety improvements such as \u201cmolecular biocontainment\u201d.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Possible_criticisms_and_responses\">Possible criticisms and responses</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The potential risks are too large, and nobody would be willing to insure against them. \n<ul>\n<li>We could avoid this by placing an appropriate limit on the amount of insurance that could be required. If it were a sufficiently large sum (perhaps in the billions of dollars), the effect should be more appropriate risk aversion, even if the tail risk for the insurer were not fully internalised.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The risks are too hard to model, and nobody would be willing to insure against them. \n<ul>\n<li>There are insurance markets for some risks that are arguably harder to model and have equally high potential losses, such as terrorism.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We already have demanding safety standards, so this wouldn\u2019t reduce risk. \n<ul>\n<li>Much of the current safety standards are focused on occupational health and safety of the lab workers rather than the general public.</li>\n<li>The market-driven approach proposed would focus attention on whichever steps were rationally believed to have the largest effect on reducing risk, and reduce other bureaucratic hurdles.</li>\n<li>Liability has been useful at improving behaviour in other domains, for example in industrial safety.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It is hard to draw a line around the harmful effects of research. Should we punish research which enables others to perform harmful acts? \n<ul>\n<li>There is a hard question, but we think we would get much of the benefit by using the simple rule that labs are only liable for simple direct consequences of their work.

Shouldn\u2019t this be a decision for the individuals? \n<ul>\n<li>Some work may be sufficiently risky that the actors cannot afford to self-insure.

We had a similar email thread here at the Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA) and the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) at Oxford, about 'blue sky funding opportunities'. As the Christmas giving season approaches, I thought I would mention a few of my favourites. I am happy to field questions about the details in the comments section, inasmuch as I know them.</p>\n<p>1. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x4NxgPbNce51_pFPzRSnUT5xYTXBCztJQ8FK1IuV8BA/edit\">Put money in an EA 'venture' fund</a> that publicly announces it is seeking to fund new projects with particular characteristics (e.g. scaling a demonstrated anti-poverty intervention). Use this 'money on the table' to encourage more entrepreneurs to come forward with early-stage business plans. Otherwise help to connect donors with founders.

This would also indirectly free up staff time for project managers and researchers in the rest of FHI.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CEA would try to recruit someone suitable for this role if it could be funded, but there may not be anyone who would meet all the requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>4. Fund a founding employee for 'CEA USA'. This person would:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Develop a strategy for how CEA USA can be most useful to the movement. The Board has met and considered a couple of options so far.</li>\n<li>Simultaneously, start cultivating a donor base who might support that expansion. If donors aren't convinced, go back and edit the strategy, as that would be a bad sign.</li>\n<li>Do the remaining operations necessary for CEA USA to receive donations in a variety of ways; hire people; do payroll; meet its legal reporting requirements;\u00a0set up a basic website,\u00a0and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The board would probably approve a recruitment process to try to find someone suitable for this position if funds were available.</p>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<p>5. Fund a professional fundraiser to raise money for CEA/FHI/<a href=\"http://cser.org/\">CSER</a>/<a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/\">FLI</a>. We have not yet found a good candidate for this, but if we were offering closer to market wages (\u00a340-60,000p.a.) we might find someone suitable to bring us expertise fundraising from major donors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you want to fund this for CEA, talk to me.

We are raising money to help market both William MacAskill's book Doing Good Better, and Peter Singer's book, The Most Good You Can Do. If funds are available, we will hire a professional book promotion company to do this. Outputs could include, depending on the amount of money raised: websites for the books; launch events; more media appearances booked; more opportunities to write op-eds based on the books' content; articles placed in newspapers connecting the books to current events; potentially even a promotional video.</p>\n<p>2. CEA could hire a contractor to work on a set of\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/bl/should_we_launch_a_podcast_about_highimpact/\">podcasts about effective altruism</a>. If we liked them, we could then produce more.</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0Test out\u00a0<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k5meevj7ONs67X6g5-8iDJEGST76V8pFPm4GX5zchEI/edit\">mainstream pamphleting about effective altruism</a>\u00a0to see how many, e.g. Giving What We Can members, this can create.</p>\n<p>4. Giving What We Can now has almost 700 members. The majority of our resources go towards attracting new members, as we see this as the most valuable use of time. Some of the work of our Director of Community goes towards deepening engagement with existing members. However, we could now usefully dedicate the Director of Community to\u00a0<em>just constantly talk to existing members</em>\u00a0- splitting out the role of talking to potential new members. What would this Director of Community do?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speak to, or personally email, every member at least once a year. Ideally build a personal relationship with them in the process.</li>\n<li>Enquire about their giving - Are they fulfilling the pledge? What is holding them back from giving more? Where are they giving? Are they aware of the latest recommendations, and the reasons for them?</li>\n<li>In some cases, give them advice on tax deductibility, our trust, other members who live near them, which charity most aligns with their values, and so on.</li>\n<li>In some cases, let them know about other activities in the effective altruist community they might want to look into, like 80,000 Hours, the Open Philanthropy Project, and so on.</li>\n<li>In the process of doing all this, drive up reporting rates for our annual giving survey. Each year we get data from (a different) 50% of members, after chasing them a bunch. This makes it hard to know how much money we are moving, and what share are dropping out each year.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also think that merely speaking regularly with someone from Giving What We Can would make members more likely to stick with the pledge long term.</p>\n<div>If it were me, I would rather fund new member recruitment over the above. However, if I were more skeptical about how much new members would give, and how long they will naturally stick with the pledge, I could prefer to fund the above. I think we will definitely want someone to take on this role full time, sooner or later.</div>\n<div><br></div></div></div>"},

For example, <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> has found that distributing some <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF\">600 bed nets, at a cost of $3,000, can prevent one infant dying of malaria</a>. For the same price, they have also found you could deliver <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative\">6,000 deworming treatments that work for around a year</a>.</p>\n<p>A common question at this point is 'how can you compare the value of helping these different people in these different ways?' Even if the numbers are accurate, how could anyone determine which of these two possible donations helps others the most?</p>\n<p>I can't offer a philosophically rigorous answer here, but I can tell you how I personally approach this puzzle. I ask myself the question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which would I prefer, if, after making the decision, I were equally likely to become any one of the people affected, and experience their lives as they would? [1]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's work through this example. First, we'll make the number of people we are considering a manageable number: for $5, I could offer 10 children deworming treatments, or alternatively offer 1 child a bed-net, which has a 1 in 600 chance of saving their life. To make this decision, I should compare three options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I don't donate, and so none of the 11 children receive any help</li>\n<li>Ten of the children receive deworming treatment, but the other one goes without a bed-net</li>\n<li>The one child receives a bed-net, but the other ten go without deworming</li>\n</ol>\n<div>If I didn't know which of these 11 children I was about to become, which choice would be more appealing?</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Obviously 2 and 3 are better than 1 (no help), but deciding between 2 and 3 is not so simple. I am confident that a malaria net is more helpful than a deworming tablet, but it is ten times more useful?</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>This question has the virtue of:</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Being 'fair', because in theory everyone's interests are given '<em>equal consideration</em>'</li>\n<li>Putting the focus on how much the <em>recipients' value the help</em>, rather than how you feel about it as a donor</li>\n<li><em>Motivating you to actually try</em> to figure out the answer, by putting you in the shoes of the people you are trying to help.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>You'll notice that this approach looks a lot like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance\">veil of ignorance</a>, a popular method among moral philosophers for determine whether a process or outcome is 'just'. It should also be very appealing to any consequentialist who cares about 'wellbeing', and thinks everyone's interests ought to be weighed equally. [2] It also looks very much like the ancient instruction to \"<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule\">love your neighbor as yourself</a></em>\".</div>\n</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>In my experience, this thought experiment pushes you towards asking good concrete questions like:</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>How much would deworming improve my quality of life immediately, and then in the long term?</li>\n<li>How harmful is it for an infant to die? How painful is it to suffer from a case of malaria?</li>\n<li>What risk of death might I be willing to tolerate to get the long-term health and incomes gains offered by deworming?</li>\n<li>And so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<div>I find the main weakness of applying this approach is that thousands of people might be affected in some way by a decision. For instance, we should not only consider the harm to young children who die of preventable diseases, but also the grief and hardship experienced by their families as a result. But that's just the start: health treatments delivered today will change the rate of economic development in a country and therefore the quality of life of all future generations. A big part of the <a href=\"http://eml.berkeley.edu/~emiguel/pdfs/miguel_wormsatwork.pdf\">case for deworming</a> is that it improves nutrition, and thereby raises education levels and incomes for people when they are adults - benefits that are then passed on to their children and their children's children.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>This doesn't make this question the wrong one to ask, but rather that tracking and weighing the impact on the hundreds of people who might be affected by an action is beyond what most of us can do in a casual way. However, I find you can still make useful progress by thinking through and adding up the impacts on paper, or in a spreadsheet. [3] When you apply this approach, it is usually possible to narrow down your choices to just a few options, though in my experience you may then not have enough information to confidently decide among that remaining handful.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n</div>\n<div>--</div>\n<div><br></div>\n</div>\n<div>[1] A very similar, probably equivalent, question is: <em>Which would I prefer if, after making the decision, I then had to sequentially experience the remaining lives of everyone affected by both options?</em></div>\n<div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>[2] One weakness is that this question is ambiguous about how to deal with interventions that change who exists (for instance, policies that raise or lower birth rates). If you assume that you must become someone - non-existence is not an option - you would end up adopting the 'average view', which actually has\u00a0<a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/#IntNewWayAggWelMeaVal\">no supporters</a> in moral philosophy. If you simply ignored anyone whose existence was conditional on your decision, you would be adopting the 'person affecting view', which itself has <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonidentity-problem/\">serious problems</a>. If you do include those people in the population of people you could become, and add 'non-existence' as the alternative for the choices which cause those people not to exist, you would be adopting the 'total view'.</div>\n</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>[3] Alternatively, if you were convinced that these long-term prosperity effects were the most important impact, and were similarly valuable across countries, you could try to estimate the increase in the rate of economic growth per $100 invested in different projects, and just seek to maximise that.</div>\n<div><br></div></div></div>"},
{"date": "14th Apr 2014", "title": "Parenthood and effective altruism", "author": "Bernadette_Young", "num_comments": "27 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p></p><h2 id=\"Summary\">Summary</h2>\nThe choice to become a parent is one of the biggest and most binding life decisions we can make. How might that decision go if you want to incorporate principles of effective altruism in the big decisions of your life? In considering the costs and attractions of parenthood, I will make the case that having children can indeed be consistent with those principles. I\u2019ll also explain why I think the EA movement should be open to the idea of parenthood as part of an EA life.\n<h2 id=\"How_does_parenthood_fit_into_a_life_based_on_effective_altruism_\">How does parenthood fit into a life based on effective altruism?</h2>\nI am not a parent myself: I have to make my estimation of the costs and some of the benefits from the data I can gather, including experiences and opinions of parents. However this decision can only be made from such a point of inexperience. Indeed, one of the reasons this is a difficult decision is that there are few realistic options for changing one\u2019s mind after one has had a child, and for women the option is only open for a limited (but unknown) timeframe.\n<h3 id=\"What_are_we_asking_\">What are we asking?</h3>\nIt can be useful to consider big decisions abstractly, to determine the ideal sequence of actions to take in our life without consideration for our individual psychologies. This can make us aware of the decision space, and encourage us to cultivate helpful desires. However, when we make decisions we must consider who we are. Within the effective altruist movement we seek to ask how we as individuals can achieve the most good possible. If a proposed action would render a particular person miserable, it\u2019s highly unlikely they will be able to stick to it. Moreover, the question of potential parenthood is usually being asked by two people whose relationship offers them mutual support. The well-being and psychological needs of both those people must factor in the analysis.\n<h3 id=\"What_are_the_costs_of_a_child_\">What are the costs of a child?</h3>\nEstimates of the financial costs of child-raising range from the considerable to the enormous, but the figures available are not robust or free from bias. A UK insurance group has estimated \u00a3220,000 to raise a child from birth to 21<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a>, with childcare (\u00a360k) and education (\u00a370k) forming the bulk of this. The number has been criticised on a number of grounds<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a> by economist Tim Harford,<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]</a> who also a pointed out the obvious benefit to a company which sells life insurance of inflating the accepted cost of parenthood. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Child Poverty Action Group made a more conservative estimate of \u00a3148,000 for a couple raising one child to the age of 18.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]</a>\u00a0This figure is derived from their minimum income standard (or MIS<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]</a>), which is their calculation of the minimum support needed for two adults and one child. Currently set at \u00a3468 per week, the MIS outstrips the minimum wage two people would earn in the UK, suggesting that two adults earning minimum wage would be unable to support any children. The fact that many do suggests the MIS is not actually a minimum.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn6\">[6]</a><p></p><p>While meeting the needs of your child will cost a significant amount \u2013 especially paid childcare in the early years \u2013 the manner in which you do it has some flexibility. As adults, as part of an EA life, we have chosen to limit our consumption and live more simply. These simpler lives may certainly exceed a \u2018minimum standard\u2019 \u2013 they can be downright lovely. Some of the reasons for this include cultivating tastes for less expensive pleasures and recreations, as well as leveraging non-financial resources such as education, or proximity to friends and family. The same principles, I believe, can be extended to our children without deprivation.</p><p>Bryan Caplan\u2019s excellent book <em>Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids</em><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn7\">[7]</a> reviews the evidence from 40 years of adoption and twin studies with a frankly liberating result: barring actual deprivation or trauma, children are largely who they are going to be as a result of their genetic makeup. In long-term measures of well-being, education and employment, parental influence exerts a temporary effect which disappears when we are no longer living with our parents. So costly added extras (music lessons, coaching and tutoring, private school fees) are probably not going to change your child\u2019s life in the long term. \u00a0(However, data on the antenatal environment suggests benefit to taking iodine, but avoiding ice-storms and licorice during pregnancy.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn8\">[8]</a>) Sharing time together and finding common interests can build a good relationship and help a child develop without major costs.</p><p>Taking this information into account, I estimate that for two parents living in the UK, the cost of raising a child to independence while providing what\u2019s needed for their health, education and wellbeing will be between \u00a3150-\u00a3200,000. If we estimate 18-21 years for them to reach such independence, this gives an approximate range of \u00a33500-\u00a34800 per parent per year. But we don\u2019t \u2018lose\u2019 our children when they are no longer dependent upon us: it might be better to consider the cost as a lifetime cost, so that if you become a parent at 30 and expect to live till you are 80, the cost is more like \u00a32000 per parent per year over one's remaining years of life.</p><p>This considerable cost can be put into perspective with other spending decisions. The annualised lifetime cost of parenthood is less than many spend annually on a car and petrol. It is less than the cost differences at stake in deciding which city to live in, or whether to live rurally. It\u2019s much less than the difference in wages between two potential careers. For this reason I think it is a real mistake to consider the financial costs of parenthood as being categorically different to many of the other lifestyle choices we make. It would seem irrational to choose a profession that would have significant adverse effect on your well-being for the sake of a \u00a32000 p.a. increase in wages.</p><p>In addition to straightforward financial outlay, parenthood comes with costs of time and opportunity. Loss of flexibility and leisure mean you won\u2019t be able to take all opportunities (like taking on extra work to make more money or advance your career). Late notice travel is unlikely to be possible. You will probably be sleep deprived for a large part of the first year or more of your child\u2019s life, and this may impact on your work performance. The work of parenting will take time, though some of it may be outsourced at the cost of increased financial outlay.</p><p>So, this baby is going to cost you about \u00a32000 a year and take a variable but large amount of your time, which will equate in the end to another chunk of money. For parents taking parental leave or working less than full time to provide childcare, there may be delay to career progression as well as income. \u00a0Does this represent an unacceptably large sum of money and time to be compatible with the goal of maximising our impacts for the good?</p><p>I would argue it\u2019s possible to integrate this cost into one\u2019s personal rather than charitable budgets. When deciding if we would try to start a family, my partner Toby and I planned a \u2018baby budget\u2019: we would each contribute a portion of our income to the fund for our child\u2019s needs. By doing this we can still meet our giving pledges, but adjust other spending patterns. In effect, we would channel money from ourselves to this other person, without reducing our commitments to give. If the costs turn out to be higher than we can absorb this way, I may reduce my giving, but am confident of still being able to give over \u00a31,000,000 in the course of my career.</p><p>Likewise, we would plan to continue to work in our careers full time (after a period of parental leave). We envisage that our personal time budgets would change pretty dramatically.\u00a0 I don\u2019t work all the hours in a day (even if it sometimes feels like it!) and neither does my partner.\u00a0 We spend time talking over coffee, we listen to music, we read, we walk, we hang out with friends, I knit and sometimes I watch a lot of crappy television. How might that time budget change? There would be fewer sleep-ins, and more wakeful nights. I would probably exchange bad TV for audiobooks while breastfeeding. Our walks would be shorter and slower, and will be more likely to end in a playground than a pub.</p><p>Some of this \u2013 the sleeplessness, bits of pregnancy and the process of childbirth \u2013 would not be fun. Again, I don\u2019t think this represents a categorical difference from the sacrifices we elect to make in pursing other long term goals. In my case, I\u2019ve worked 84 hours of night shifts in a week, a feat which requires several days to recover physically and mentally, because it was integral to training in my career. I\u2019ve studied for hours at either end of a full time working day because I want to progress in my specialty.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn9\">[9]</a> If the payoff is worth it, I am prepared to do this too.\n</p><h3 id=\"So_what_s_the_gain_\">So what\u2019s the gain?</h3>\nFirst, there can be personal benefits. While parenting is work, it\u2019s also a challenge and a discovery. To observe and take part in the growth of a human from a ball of cells to someone who can talk, think, reason and love sounds to me like a most amazing journey. I expect that parenthood will challenge me to the end of my character. I expect to learn and change and grow.<p></p><p>I don\u2019t think you have to become a parent to learn these lessons, but nor do I think I\u2019ll learn them just by working at my paid job. I might learn them from traveling widely, from climbing mountains, from learning another language, by arguing with strangers in a bar at 3am, by reading all of Derek Parfit\u2019s works, by singing songs with friends in the backyard on a sunny afternoon. For most of us, living a life means doing a lot of things that don\u2019t necessarily earn money or prestige. Some people might be able to work 80 hours a week, to just work and sleep and thrive on that. My observation is that even among highly motivated and talented coworkers, such people are the exception rather than the rule. If I did that I am reasonably sure I\u2019d be burned out and unhappy within 5 years, making such a plan not merely demanding but directly self-defeating.</p><p>The desire to be a parent \u2013 to have children, either biologically or by other means \u2013 does not always arise as a clear-eyed appraisal of the potential benefits. The (faintly derisive) term \u2018baby fever\u2019 was coined to denote the intense desire for children that many people experience without being able to fully explain, and possibly in the face of their own analysis of the arguments for and against having a child.\u00a0 Some preliminary psychological research suggests the phenomenon has complex origins and is observable in both men and women.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn10\">[10]</a></p><p>It is clear that the longing for children that some people experience can not be overcome by clearly viewing the obstacles to and pitfalls of parenthood. The nature of this desire can be so strong, that even when achieving parenthood seems impossible, people\u2019s wish to become parents will drive them to extraordinary efforts. Fertility clinics treat patients prepared to endure years of waiting<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn11\">[11]</a>, followed by uncomfortable and invasive testing, difficult procedures and at least a 65% chance of failure<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn12\">[12]</a> in an effort to become parents. If they were able to rationalise themselves out of wanting children, they would stop before exhausting every possible resource \u2013 medical, emotional and financial \u2013 in efforts to start a family that might span a decade.\u00a0 In the light of this reality, the rationalist suggestion I have encountered \u2013 that one guard against a desire to become a parent by pre-emptively being sterilised before the desire has arisen \u2013 seems a recipe for psychological disaster.</p><p>I don\u2019t have the answer to the origin of the longing for children that many experience. It\u2019s almost certainly due to a complex mixture of biological and social factors. It might even be an evolutionary trick. However, the fact remains that this desire is real and difficult to manage if unfulfilled.\u00a0 It can\u2019t be simply discounted or argued away as irrational. It needs to form part of our considerations in whether or not we choose to (attempt to) become parents, because we must consider how tenable it is to sacrifice our chance to fulfil these desires</p><p>Finally we may ask whether parenthood \u2013 and the resulting person created \u2013 will benefit the wider world? This is a harder good to calculate or rely upon. The inheritance of specific character traits is difficult to predict. It\u2019s certainly not guaranteed that your offspring will embrace all of your values throughout their lifetime. The burden of onerous parental expectations are extensively documented, and it would appear foolish to have children on the expectation they will be altruistic in the same way you are. However, your child is likely to resemble you in many important respects. By adulthood, the heritability of IQ is between 0.7 and 0.8,<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn13\">[13]</a>\u00a0and there is evidence from twin studies of significant heritability of complex traits like empathy.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn14\">[14]</a>\u00a0This would give them a high probability of adding significant net good to the world.</p><p>For EA\u2019s making this decision, there is a further benefit in changing how the world sees the EA life. A core message of <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> is that many people can do a significant amount of good. We are so comparatively wealthy that without significant sacrifice, we can help thousands of people. If the way we live implies that to make this difference you must sacrifice parenthood, this will drastically narrow the range of people who can consider doing the same.\n</p><h3 id=\"How_do_we_weigh_these_up_\">How do we weigh these up?</h3>\nIt\u2019s a complicated ledger.<p></p><p>On the one hand: the vast bulk of your leisure time for perhaps five years and a significant portion for the next 13, a less flexible work and home life, the emotional cost of knowing your heart may never be your own again, and finally your share of the financial cost of \u00a3150,000-\u00a3200,000. Two parents might be able to save 70 lives by donating this money to Against Malaria Foundation</p><p>On the other hand: we demonstrate the level of sacrifice required to make the world significantly better does not require a dramatic deviation from what most people consider \u2018a normal life\u2019; we gain all the good that might be contained in one life; two parents grow and develop and enjoy a lifetime with their child, and, for some, there is the fulfilment of a deep desire.</p><p>The nature of an individual will almost certainly play a determining role. For myself, I could theoretically cut my personal spending anyway, work more and be able to give more money, to save more lives. I could live just to work, earning to give. But I know such a life plan would be self-defeating and would not last. I\u2019m happy donating 50% of my income over my life, but if I also chose not have a child simply to raise that amount to 55%, then that final 5% would cost me more than all the rest, to the extent I don\u2019t believe I could continue to do so. Julia Wise writes beautifully about how it changed her outlook on life to allow herself the possibility of children,<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn15\">[15]</a>\u00a0and it\u2019s a feeling that I totally understand because I\u2019ve felt the same. I believe that by making this decision to spend my personal money and time budgets in this way, I\u2019m deciding to meet a major psychological need and to plan a life I can continue to live in the long term. I think this decision will also benefit my future child, and I think there is a significant chance it will benefit the wider world.\n</p><h3 id=\"Is_EA__family_friendly___Why_does_it_matter_\">Is EA \u201cfamily friendly\u201d? Why does it matter?</h3>\nWithin the EA movement I\u2019ve sometimes encountered a fairly dismissive attitude to parenthood in the abstract. Sometimes the best on offer is a sort of resigned tolerance, with EA\u2019s advocating we not \u201cshun\u201d people just for having children.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn16\">[16]</a>\u00a0 At other times I\u2019ve seen parenthood characterised as foolish, selfish or both, to be discouraged with great zeal. I genuinely wonder where this hostility comes from. Is it simply that the hostile attitudes I\u2019ve encountered have been expressed by people quite early in their lives? The onset of a desire to have a family may post-date one\u2019s third decade (creating difficulties for the half of our species with a limited reproductive lifespan). Possibly it\u2019s so prevalent because in our society women are more likely to express a desire for children than men are, and men dominate some internet EA conversations.<p></p><p>I hope these attitudes aren\u2019t representative. Providing some counter evidence is that since announcing that we are expecting a baby, my husband Toby and I have both experienced a universally warm and excited response from friends and colleagues in the EA community. I\u2019m reasonably sure \u2013 and I certainly hope \u2013 they aren\u2019t just deciding not to shun us.</p><p>I think it\u2019s vital that as a movement, EA enthusiastically embraces parents and potential parents. In order to spread EA values, and to build a robust movement, these values must be tenable as part of a whole life. We are not machines who can spend every waking moment working or earning money to give. We are not able to ignore our fundamental needs in order to eliminate the needs that divert us from spending every moment maximising our actions to a single goal. We need to take into account our psychological needs as we set the goals and paths for our lives.</p><p>Finally, I believe we need to recognise that to understand and engage with our complex world, we need to encompass a range of experiences and perspectives. Recent criticisms of the EA movement have raised the concern that we risk cultivating a monoculture.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftn17\">[17]</a>\u00a0Parenthood is only one variance we can embrace: education, gender, ethnicity are several others, as we continue to build a movement that really does strive to achieve the best it can in the world.\n</p><h2 id=\"References\">References</h2>\n<div>\n<div><p></p><p><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref1\">1]</a> <a href=\"http://www.lv.com/life-insurance/useful-information/cost-of-a-child\">http://www.lv.com/life-insurance/useful-information/cost-of-a-child</a>, Accessed: 19 Jan 2014]</p><p></p></div>\n<div><p></p><p><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> For instance, more than \u00a350,000 of their figure assumes parents will be pay university fees for their adult offspring (rather than take a universally available fee loan, repayable when their earnings reach a threshold which is currently set above median wage).</p><p></p></div>\n<div><p></p><p><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ftnref3\">[3]</a> Harford, Tim (presenter) More or Less\u00a0 (audio podcast) 2014, Jan 31.

{"date": "23rd Nov 2014", "title": "When should an Effective Altruist be vegetarian?", "author": "Katja_Grace", "num_comments": "56 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2014/11/21/when-should-an-effective-altruist-be-vegetarian/\">Meteuphoric</a></em></p>\n<p>I have lately noticed several\u00a0people\u00a0wondering why more\u00a0<a href=\"/\">Effective Altruists</a>\u00a0are not vegetarians.\u00a0I am personally not a vegetarian because I don't think it is an effective way to be altruistic.</p>\n<p><span>As far as I can tell the\u00a0fact that many EAs are not vegetarians\u00a0is surprising\u00a0to some\u00a0because they think 'animals are probably morally relevant' basically implies 'we shouldn't eat animals'. To my ear, this sounds about as absurd\u00a0as if\u00a0Givewell's explanation\u00a0of their\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative\">recommendation of SCI</a>\u00a0stopped after\u00a0'the developing world exists, or at least has a high probability of doing so'.</span></p>\n<p>(By the way,\u00a0I do get to a calculation at the bottom, after some speculation\u00a0about why the calculation I think is appropriate is\u00a0unlike what I take others' implicit calculations to be. Feel free to\u00a0just scroll down and look at it).</p>\n<p>I think this fairly large\u00a0difference between\u00a0my and many\u00a0vegetarians'\u00a0guesses at the value of vegetarianism arises because they think the relevant question is whether the suffering to the animal is worse than the pleasure to themselves at eating the animal. This question sounds superficially plausibly\u00a0relevant, but I think on closer consideration you will agree that it is the wrong question.</p>\n<p>The real question is not whether the cost to you is small, but whether you could do more\u00a0good for the same small cost.</p>\n<p>Similarly, when deciding whether to donate $5 to a random charity, the\u00a0question is whether you could do more good by\u00a0donating the\u00a0money\u00a0to\u00a0the most effective charity\u00a0you know of.\u00a0Going vegetarian because it\u00a0relieves the animals more than it hurts you\u00a0is the equivalent of donating to a random developing world charity because\u00a0it\u00a0relieves\u00a0the suffering of an\u00a0impoverished child more than\u00a0foregoing $5\u00a0increases your suffering.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Trading_with_inconvenience_and_displeasure\">Trading with\u00a0inconvenience and displeasure</strong></p>\n<p>My imaginary vegetarian debate partner\u00a0objects to this on grounds\u00a0that vegetarianism is different from donating to ineffective\u00a0charities, because to be a vegetarian you are spending effort and enjoying your life less rather than spending money, and\u00a0you can't really reallocate that\u00a0inconvenience and\u00a0displeasure\u00a0to, say,\u00a0preventing artificial intelligence disaster or feeding the hungry,\u00a0if don't use it on reading food labels and eating tofu. If I\u00a0were to go ahead and eat the sausage\u00a0instead - the concern\u00a0goes -\u00a0probably I\u00a0would just go on with the rest of my\u00a0life\u00a0exactly\u00a0the same, and a bunch of farm animals\u00a0somewhere\u00a0would be\u00a0the worse for it, and I\u00a0scarcely better.</p>\n<p>I agree that if the meat eating decision\u00a0were separated from everything else in this way, then the decision really would be about your welfare vs. the animal's welfare,\u00a0and you should probably eat the tofu.</p>\n<p>However whether you can trade being vegetarian for more effective sacrifices\u00a0is largely\u00a0a question of whether you choose to do so. And\u00a0if vegetarianism is not the most effective\u00a0way to inconvenience yourself, then it\u00a0is clear that\u00a0you should choose to do so.\u00a0If you eat meat now in exchange for suffering some more effective annoyance at another time,\u00a0you and the\u00a0world\u00a0can be\u00a0better off.</p>\n<p>Imagine an EA friend\u00a0says to you that\u00a0she gives\u00a0substantial\u00a0money to whatever random charity\u00a0has put a tin in\u00a0whatever shop she is in, because it's better than the donuts and new dresses\u00a0she\u00a0would buy otherwise. She\u00a0doesn't see how not giving the money to the random charity would\u00a0really cause her to\u00a0give\u00a0it to a better charity - empirically she would spend it on luxuries. What do you say to this?</p>\n<p>If she were my friend, I might point out that the money isn't meant to magically move somewhere better - she may have to consciously direct it there. She might need to write down how much she was going to give to the random charity, then look at the note\u00a0later for instance. Or she might do well to decide once and for all how much to give to charity and how much to spend on herself, and then stick to that. As an aside, I might\u00a0also feel\u00a0that\u00a0she was using the term 'Effective Altruist' kind of\u00a0broadly.</p>\n<p>I see vegetarianism for the sake of\u00a0not managing to\u00a0trade\u00a0inconveniences as\u00a0quite similar.\u00a0And\u00a0in both\u00a0cases you risk\u00a0spending your life doing suboptimal things every time a suboptimal altruistic opportunity has a chance to steal resources from what would be your personal purse. This seems like\u00a0something that\u00a0your personal and altruistic values should cooperate in avoiding.</p>\n<p>It is likely\u00a0too\u00a0expensive to keep track of\u00a0an elaborate trading system, but you should\u00a0at least be able to make reasonable long term\u00a0arrangements. For instance, if instead of eating vegetarian you ate a bit frugally and saved and donated a few dollars per meal,\u00a0you would probably do more good (see calculations lower in this post). So if frugal eating\u00a0were similarly annoying, it would be better. Eating frugally\u00a0is inconvenient in very similar ways to vegetarianism, so is a particularly plausible trade if you are skeptical that such trades can be made. I claim you could make very different trades though, for instance foregoing\u00a0the pleasure of an extra five minute's break and working instead\u00a0sometimes. Or you could decide once and for all how much annoyance to have, and then choose most worthwhile bits of annoyance, or put a dollar value on your own time and suffering\u00a0and try to be consistent.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Nebulous_life_worsening_costs_of_vegetarianism\">Nebulous life-worsening costs of vegetarianism</strong></p>\n<p>There is a separate psychological question which is often mixed up with the above issue. That is, whether making your life marginally less gratifying and more annoying in small ways will make you sufficiently less productive to undermine the good done by your sacrifice. This is not about whether you will do something a bit costly another time for the sake of altruism, but whether just spending your attention and happiness on vegetarianism will harm your other\u00a0efforts to do good, and cause more\u00a0harm than good.</p>\n<p>I find this plausible in many cases, but I expect\u00a0it\u00a0to vary a lot by person.\u00a0My mother seems to\u00a0think it's\u00a0basically free to eat supplements, whereas to me\u00a0every additional daily routine seems to encumber my life and require me to\u00a0spend disproportionately more time thinking about unimportant things. Some people find it hard to concentrate when unhappy, others don't.\u00a0Some people struggle to feed themselves adequately\u00a0at all,\u00a0while others actively enjoy preparing\u00a0food.</p>\n<p>There are offsetting positives from vegetarianism which also vary across people.\u00a0For instance there is the pleasure\u00a0of\u00a0self-sacrifice, the joy\u00a0of\u00a0being\u00a0part of a proud and moralizing minority, and the absence of\u00a0the horror of\u00a0eating other beings. There are also perhaps health benefits, which probably don't vary that much by people, but people do vary in how big they think\u00a0the health benefits are.</p>\n<p>Another \u00a0way you might accidentally lose more value than you save is in\u00a0spending little bits of time which are hard to measure or\u00a0notice. For instance,\u00a0vegetarianism means\u00a0spending a bit\u00a0more time searching for vegetarian alternatives,\u00a0researching nutrition, buying\u00a0supplements,\u00a0writing emails back to people who invite you to dinner explaining your dietary restrictions, etc.\u00a0The value of different people's time varies a lot,\u00a0as does the extent to which an additional\u00a0vegetarianism routine would tend to eat their time.</p>\n<p>On a less psychological note, the\u00a0<a title=\"Intelligence Amplification Interview\" href=\"http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2014/03/28/intelligence-amplification-interview/\">potential drop in IQ</a>\u00a0(~5 points?!) from missing out on creatine is a particularly terrible example of vegetarianism making people less productive. Now that we know about creatine and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=creatine\">can supplement it</a>, creatine itself is not such an issue.

If we suppose a life \u00a0is 37 DALYs, as they assume in the spreadsheet, then 12.5 days is worth 5936*12.5/37*365.25 = $5.49. Elie produced two estimates that were generous to cash and to deworming separately, and gave the highest and lowest estimates for the cost-effectiveness of deworming, of the group. They imply\u00a0a range of\u00a0$1.40-$45.98 to do as much good via SCI as eating vegetarian for a meal).</span></p>\n<p>Given this calculation, we get a few cents to a couple of dollars as the cost of doing similar amounts of good to averting a meat meal via other means.\u00a0We are not finished yet though - there were many factors\u00a0I didn't take into account in the calculation, because I wanted to separate relatively straightforward\u00a0facts for which I have good evidence from guesses.\u00a0Here are other considerations\u00a0I can think of, which reduce the relative value of averting meat eating:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Chicken brains\u00a0are fairly\u00a0small, suggesting their internal experience is less than that of humans. More generally, in the spectrum of entities\u00a0between\u00a0humans and\u00a0microbes, chickens are at least some of the way to microbes. And you wouldn't pay much to save a microbe.</li>\n<li>Eating a chicken only reduces the number of chicken produced by some fraction.\u00a0According to Peter Hurford,\u00a0an extra\u00a0<a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-eat-less-meat/\">0.3 chickens</a>\u00a0are produced if\u00a0you demand\u00a01 chicken. I didn't include this in the above calculation because I am not sure\u00a0of\u00a0the time scale of the relevant\u00a0elasticities (if they are short-run elasticities, they might\u00a0underestimate the effect of vegetarianism).</li>\n<li>Vegetable production\u00a0may also have negative effects on animals.</li>\n<li>Givewell estimates have been rigorously checked relative to other things, and\u00a0<a title=\"Why would info worsen altruistic options?\" href=\"http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/why-would-info-worsen-altruistic-options/\">evaluations tend to get worse as you check them</a>. For instance, you\u00a0might forget to include any of the things in this list in your evaluation of vegetarianism. Probably there\u00a0are more things I forgot. That is, if you looked into vegetarianism with the same detail as SCI,\u00a0it would become\u00a0more pessimistic, and so cheaper to do as much good with SCI.</li>\n<li>It is not at all obvious that meat animal lives are not worth living on average.\u00a0Relatedly, animals generally want to be alive, which we might want to give some weight to.</li>\n<li>Animal welfare in general\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/6c/human_and_animal_interventions_the_longterm_view/\">appears</a>\u00a0to have negligible predictable\u00a0effect on the future\u00a0(very debatably), and there are probably things which can have huge impact on the\u00a0<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/nbeckstead/research\">future</a>. This would\u00a0make animal altruism\u00a0worse\u00a0compared to\u00a0present-day human interventions, and much\u00a0worse compared to\u00a0interventions directed\u00a0at affecting the far future, such as averting existential risk.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My own quick\u00a0guesses at factors by which\u00a0the relative value of avoiding meat\u00a0should be multiplied, to account for\u00a0these considerations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Moral value of small animals: 0.05</li>\n<li>Raised price reduces others' consumption: 0.5</li>\n<li>Vegetables\u00a0harm\u00a0animals too: 0.9</li>\n<li>Rigorous estimates look worse: 0.9</li>\n<li>Animal lives might be worth living: 0.2</li>\n<li>Animals don't affect the future:\u00a00.1 relative to human\u00a0poverty\u00a0charities</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thus given my estimates, we scale down the above figures by\u00a00.05*0.5*0.9*0.9*0.2*0.1 =0.0004. This\u00a0gives us\u00a0$0.0008-$0.002 to do as much good as eating a vegetarian meal by spending on GiveWell's top charities.\u00a0Without the factor for the future (which doesn't apply to these other animal charities), we only\u00a0multiply the\u00a0cost of eating a meat meal by 0.004.\u00a0This gives us a price of $0.0003 with\u00a0the Humane League, or $0.002 on improving chicken\u00a0welfare in other ways.\u00a0These are not price differences\u00a0that will\u00a0change my meal\u00a0choices very often! I think I would often be willing to pay at least a couple of extra dollars to eat meat, setting aside animal suffering. So if I were to avoid eating meat, then assuming I keep fixed\u00a0how much of my budget I spend on myself and how much I spend on altruism, I would be trading\u00a0a\u00a0couple of dollars of value for less than one\u00a0thousandth of that.</p>\n<p>I\u00a0encourage you to estimate your own numbers for the above factors, and to\u00a0recalculate\u00a0the overall price according to your beliefs.\u00a0<strong>If you\u00a0would happily pay this much\u00a0(in my case, less than $0.002) to eat meat on many\u00a0occasions, you probably shouldn't be a vegetarian.</strong>\u00a0You are better off paying that cost elsewhere.\u00a0If you would rarely be willing to pay the calculated price,\u00a0you should perhaps consider being a vegetarian, though note that the calculation was\u00a0conservative in favor of vegetarianism, so you might want to run it again more carefully. Note that\u00a0in judging\u00a0what you would be willing to pay to eat meat, you should take into account everything except the direct cost to animals.</p>\n<p>There are many common\u00a0reasons you might not be willing to eat meat, given these calculations, e.g.:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don't enjoy\u00a0eating meat</li>\n<li>You think meat is pretty unhealthy</li>\n<li>You belong to a social cluster\u00a0of vegetarians, and don't like conflict</li>\n<li>You think convincing enough others to be vegetarians is the most cost-effective way to make the world\u00a0better, and being a vegetarian is a great way to have heaps of conversations about vegetarianism, which you believe makes people feel better about vegetarians overall,\u00a0to the extent that they are frequently compelled to become vegetarians.</li>\n<li>'For signaling' is another common explanation I have heard, which I think is meant to be similar to the above, though I'm not actually sure of the details.</li>\n<li>You aren't able to\u00a0treat costs like these as fungible (as discussed above)</li>\n<li>You\u00a0are completely\u00a0indifferent to\u00a0what you eat (in that case,\u00a0you\u00a0would probably do better eating as cheaply as possible, but maybe everything is the same price)</li>\n<li>\u00a0You consider the\u00a0act-omission distinction morally relevant</li>\n<li>You are very skeptical of the ability to affect anything, and in particular\u00a0have\u00a0substantially greater confidence in the market - to farm\u00a0some fraction of a\u00a0pig fewer in expectation if you abstain from pork for long enough - than in\u00a0nonprofits and complicated schemes. (Though in that case, consider buying free-range eggs and selling them as cage eggs).</li>\n<li>You think\u00a0the suffering of animals is of extreme importance compared to the suffering of humans or loss of human lives, and don't trust the figures I have given for improving the lives of egg-laying chickens, and don't want to be a hypocrite. Actually, you still probably shouldn't here - the egg-laying chicken number is just an example of a plausible alternative way to help animals. You should really check quite a few of these before settling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However\u00a0I think for\u00a0wannabe effective altruists\u00a0with the usual array of characteristics,\u00a0vegetarianism\u00a0is likely to be quite ineffective.</p></div></div>"},

It was conducted by Melody Guan and Yifan Wu.</p>\n<p>Keith apparently has a very non-EA perspective, but I think there are some interesting insights nonetheless.</p>\n<p><br><strong>How much attention does climate change warrant? A Conversation with Climate Scientist and Energy Technology and Public Policy Expert David Keith</strong></p>\n<p>David Keith is Professor of Applied Physics in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Professor of Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. His academic work currently focuses on solar geoengineering: assessments of the technology, public engagement with its social consequences, and the development of related public policies and governance mechanisms. Following years of research on direct air capture, Keith founded and currently serves as president of Carbon Engineering, a Calgary-based start-up that works on capturing carbon dioxide from ambient air to produce low carbon fuels for transportation on an industrial scale. Keith also co-manages the Fund for Innovative Climate and Energy Research, a multimillion-dollar philanthropic geoengineering research fund established by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Keith was named Canadian Geographic\u2019s Environmental Scientist of the Year in 2006 and one of TIME magazine\u2019s Heroes of the Environment in 2009.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://harvardea.org/assets/img/2014-12-04/keith.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>HEA</strong>: How much effort should we devote to combatting climate change in relation to more immediate issues like infectious diseases?</p>\n<p>Keith: If all you care about is direct measurable human welfare, measured by how long people are going to live or whether or not they can get enough basic materials, then I think climate change is not as high priority as pollution and other social problems we face. I think climate is an environmental problem, so for lots of reasons I would like to leave more of the natural world to be enjoyed by my great grand kids and everybody else\u2019s. I think there is some real value to not egregiously messing with this wondrous thing that we\u2019ve inherited, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because we need it that much. Some people want to say that the reason we should protect the climate is purely for utilitarian practical reasons: we have to do it because otherwise there is an existential threat. I don\u2019t see much evidence for that from climate change.</p>\n<p><strong>HEA</strong>: Won\u2019t climate change result in severe consequences for humanity?</p>\n<p>Keith: Severe compared to what, for whom, and at what time scale? Humans are moving extraordinarily fast and causing extraordinary impact on human welfare. I worked on climate change for half of my life myself; I care about it. I just think that claims that you could compare it directly with some other threads are overblown. Take sea-level rise as an example: a two meter rise, which is a very high-end estimate, actually will occur really slowly compared to other social factors. Yes that means Miami won\u2019t be there, but big deal. People don\u2019t think through how big the other changes are going to be in the next two centuries. In terms of direct impact on human welfare, I would think that changes due to Southern Florida going gradually under sea level over a hundred years won\u2019t kill anybody directly, and real estate values really aren\u2019t meaningfully valued on that time scale. I personally think that it\u2019s an outrageous idea that we would let the world be damaged that much, but I don\u2019t think that the reason is the standard economist rationalization for why we should act on climate change: add up all the damages from sea level rise and whatnot and the cost of control, with discounting over time, and calculate the optimum. Under that story people like me care about climate change because we are going to make our grand kids one or two percent richer because the amount that we save from climate damages is larger than the cost to cut emissions. I find that utterly unconvincing. If the answer were the opposite, if I were to make people one percent poorer to deal with climate change, I would still want to do it for reasons that aren\u2019t captured by economic calculations.</p>\n<p><strong>HEA</strong>: Could you comment on the general state of climate policy today?</p>\n<p>Keith: The general state of climate policy is that it\u2019s not going very far. Nothing much is happening. But things might happen. I\u2019ve been involved with this for over a quarter of a century and people always think that things are going to happen and I don\u2019t expect anything dramatic to happen, to say Paris, next year. I think that there will be announcements that make it sound good, but I\u2019m skeptical that something really dramatic will happen. I think the underlying reasons why it\u2019s hard to get a deal are deep, and they are not to do with opposition by this or that ugly fossil fuel company. This is not to say there isn\u2019t that opposition, there absolute is and it\u2019s awful, but it\u2019s to do with the fact that the costs of cutting emissions are paid for locally while the benefits are felt a hundred years in the future. It\u2019s the time and space aspect. We\u2019ve dealt with externalities: in the developed world we have done an extraordinary job in improving air quality, improving water quality, toxin, DDT, and we\u2019ve dealt with externalities that were one or two percent of GDP. China now is facing externalities from air pollution of several percent of GDP and China will very certainly deal with those\u00a0<span>because</span>\u00a0if the Chinese government imposes these big costs the generation that pays the cost of emission controls will see their air get cleaner and there is a basic political deal there. But climate isn\u2019t like that because of the very very long time delays and the global aspect.</p>\n<p><strong>HEA</strong>: Is solar geoengineering a suitable backup plan if policy changes fail us?</p>\n<p><strong>Keith</strong>: Solar geo-engineering seems to act quickly and, from current evidence, has pretty widespread benefits, making it likely that politicians will ultimately do it, and it doesn\u2019t require a global agreement that cutting emissions does.</p>\n<p>But in the end you have to bring the emissions to zero to stabilize climate. No amount of solar engineering can solve that problem. If you don\u2019t restrain emissions you don\u2019t have a stable climate. And I\u2019m just making an observation that I think politicians should react. I didn\u2019t say anything about what I think the right answer was and I have no idea what promising means in this context.</p>\n<p><strong>HEA</strong>: You have conducted research on whether patents on solar geoengineering technologies could be banned and advocated for keeping these technologies in the public domain. What are the dangers of privatizing solar geoengineering?</p>\n<p><strong>Keith</strong>: With incredibly technologies like this you could destroy the world. You don\u2019t want private enterprise making nuclear weapons, and you don\u2019t want that with geo-engineering. The decisions could impact the whole world and need to be taken as legitimately and as transparently as possible and that\u2019s not what companies do. For these public policy matters, it\u2019s important to discourage private enterprise and business involvement in solar geo-engineering because it has such potentially high leverage and therefore presents such a threat. The incentive to distort the facts about it would be so large so I\u2019m strongly against doing that in a for profit mode.</p>\n<p><strong>HEA</strong>: Where should people put their money to see environmental change?</p>\n<p><strong>Keith</strong>: To me I\u2019m less excited by the big environmental NGOs, which seem a bit too business like and too captured inside the old way, so I\u2019m more excited by some of the new ideas of how to mobilize people that are like 350.org, and the divestment movement, but there\u2019s a whole lot of things. Personally when I give money, I give money to lobbying organizations that will change laws because I think the way we are going to restrain carbon emissions is through changing people\u2019s attitudes and laws and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s through encouraging behavior that would lower individual carbon footprints because we need to bring emissions to zero and people are not going to bring their consumption to zero; you are going to do that through technological change: switching to more efficient vehicles, solar power, nuclear power what have you. So I think it\u2019s very important to have non-governmental organizations and environmental groups fight to have these regulations passed.</p>\n<p><strong>HEA</strong>: What are some of the most effective ways of changing the mindset of politicians and the population regarding climate change and the actions we should take?</p>\n<p><strong>Keith</strong>: These things depend on social movements! I\u2019m really excited by the students here who are are involved with the divestment movement. I think divestment narrowly draws, if nothing else, changes, and of course the critics are right in that it won\u2019t do much but the point of the divestment movement is trying to be really clear about what the long term consequences of our choices are with regard to carbon and what the impact of that is and to try and hold senior decision makers including the big investors and senior people who run Harvard accountable for that, and I think it\u2019s fantastic. I think it\u2019s part of an attempt to make a social movement that spreads more broadly the idea that people really have to demand to change, to restrain the amount of carbon emissions. I think these things are absolutely and inherently political and should not be decided in some cold analytic way. Indeed a lot of last decade\u2019s policies been done too much by professionals who suppose they could calculate their way into the right answer and we need more activism.</p></div></div>"},

Use the <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/map\">map of effective altruists</a> to find people near you - you can <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/map/people/all\">search by city or country</a>, and contact people you find via their linked contact forms. If you\u2019d like others to be able to find you, <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/map/add\">sign up to the map yourself</a>! To avoid decision paralysis, it is often better to meet any effective altruists that you discover sooner, even if it\u2019s just over a coffee, rather than agonising over the ideal location for a full-scale meetup that may never get around to creating.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>2. Find more effective altruists. Let others know that you might be interested in meeting by commenting on this article. Do the same at the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/\">Effective Altruists Facebook group</a>. You can contact effective altruist organisations like Giving What They Can and 80,000 Hours, who may also be able to link you in with some contacts, especially if they have previously established a chapter near you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>3. Once you\u2019ve arranged to meet, <a href=\"/meetups/new/\">announce it</a>\u00a0on\u00a0the Effective Altruism Forum.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We hope that by using these resources, meeting effective altruists is now easier than ever. As for how to make meetups awesome, Sam Hilton has some extra resources that he will share in an upcoming post.</p></div></div>"},

If there is relevant scientific literature, we start our inquiry by doing a literature search.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Expert_common_sense\">Expert common sense</h3>\n<p>When we first encounter a question, our initial aim is normally to work out: (i) who are the relevant experts? (ii) what would they say about this question? We call what they would say \u2018expert common sense\u2019, and we think it often forms a good starting position (<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/iao/common_sense_as_a_prior/\">more</a>). We try not to deviate from expert common sense unless we have an account of why it\u2019s wrong.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Quantification\">Quantification</h3>\n<p>Which careers make the most difference can be unintuitive, since it\u2019s difficult to grasp the scale and scope of different problems, which often differ by orders of magnitude. This makes it important to attempt to quantify and model key factors when possible. The process of quantification is also often valuable for learning more about an issue, and making your reasoning transparent to others. However, we recognise that for most questions we care about, quantified models contain huge (often unknown) uncertainties, and therefore, should not be followed blindly. We always weigh the results of quantified models against their robustness compared to qualitative analysis and common sense.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The_experience_of_the_people_we_coach\">The experience of the people we coach</h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve coached hundreds of people on career decisions and have a wider network of people we gather information from who are aligned with our mission.

my contribution to this month's blogging carnival, with the theme of \"blind spots\".</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://benkuhn.net\">Ben Kuhn</a> for substantial help organizing and editing this post.</p>\n<p>There's a trope in the EA world of comparing every activity to spending the same amount of time working and donating the money earned to charity. \u00a0The implication is that one shouldn't do any potentially charitable activities unless they meet this extremely high standard. \u00a0Some examples:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eliezer uses a canonical example from economics of a <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/65/money_the_unit_of_caring/\">lawyer who volunteers in a soup kitchen</a>.</li>\n<li><a

href=\"/ea/b2/open_thread_5/1gd\">Voting</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This naive hour-for-hour comparison adequately captures the actual consequences of decisions that trade off time, and as I'll discuss in this post, I think they unfairly discourage us from using our time other ways. \u00a0We need ways to make decisions about how we spend our time that take into account how we're spending our time overall, not just any particular hour.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why_the_naive_hour_for_hour_tradeoff_model_doesn_t_work\">Why the naive hour-for-hour tradeoff model doesn't work</h2>\n<p><strong id=\"Non_linear_return_on_work\">Non-linear return on work</strong></p>\n<p>These comparisons assume that return on work is linear, that is, the marginal hour at work is worth the same amount of money as the average hour at work. \u00a0This isn\u2019t usually true. \u00a0People who earn salaries usually earn their salary as long as they fulfil the minimum requirements for their job. \u00a0Even if working more than the minimum helps you earn more, there's no reason to think that it does so at the same rate.</p>\n<p>For a clear example, consider a teacher. \u00a0They earn $40,000 a year and have 12 weeks off during the summer, so their wage for the 40 weeks that school is on is $1,000/week. \u00a0During the summer, they can try to get a second job, but they probably can't do better than $10/hour, bringing them to $400/week during the summer. \u00a0Since teacher salaries are usually based on seniority and not skill, putting extra time into school-related things probably doesn't pay off monetarily. \u00a0Even though the average wage is about $860/week, their marginal income is more like $400/week. \u00a0The comparisons above, then, give twice the lost income a teacher could reasonably expect from a lost hour of work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What if I'm a software engineer? \u00a0Since working more in tech probably helps you primarily by increasing the probability that you are promoted, it's harder to estimate your expected reward. \u00a0Some considerations:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raises in the tech industry are usually small; you usually increase your pay only by switching jobs.</li>\n<li>If you work hard and climb the tech career ladder faster, you enjoy higher salaries for longer, multiplying the effect of your work.</li>\n<li>Tech salaries have a long tail. \u00a0If you end up the CTO of a successful company, you make a lot of money, but very few people achieve that. \u00a0One thing this means is that moving from the 60th percentile of tech workers to the 65th is probably much less valuable than moving from the 94th to the 99th.</li>\n<li>It\u2019s also probably much easier to move from the 60th percentile of tech workers to the 65th than from the 94th to the 99th, because the other people in the 94th percentile of tech workers are also pretty awesome.</li>\n<li>It\u2019s not obvious that working more will help you get ahead at all in tech (although I think it\u2019s likely), and if so, what kind of work. \u00a0Learning new technical skills, expanding your open source resume, working for high-prestige companies, expanding your network, and investing in leadership and interpersonal skills all seem plausible routes forward, and I think any of them could be the best, and any of them could have almost no effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Given this, my guess for the value of a marginal hour for a tech worker is something between a quarter and a half of their average salary. \u00a0Again, this is enough of a difference that we could be significantly misled by valuing their time at their average hourly wage, as the examples above do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Counterfactual_spending\">Counterfactual spending</strong></p>\n<p>When I see these comparisons, they always compare the good done by volunteering to the amount of good that could be done with the full amount of money that the potential volunteer would earn. \u00a0This comparison makes some sense in the abstract-- if I\u2019m willing to take a week off work to do good, I should be willing to work an additional week and donate the full amount, not just part of it. \u00a0However, if I usually donate 10% of my earnings to charity, I will probably only donate 10% of my weeks earnings if I work that week.</p>\n<p>Note that this doesn\u2019t apply to everyone-- if you donate all of your earnings above an amount that you are certain to make, you can claim that every marginal dollar would be given to charity. \u00a0However, if you don\u2019t use that system, and I believe most of us don\u2019t, you should either expect to donate your usual percentage to charity, or to do some complicated accounting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Counterfactual_Time_Use\">Counterfactual Time Use</strong></p>\n<p>Another assumption these comparisons make is that time time spent on one of these activities comes only out of work time. \u00a0I think this is often false, and we should generally guess that volunteer time comes partly out of work and partly out of recreation time.</p>\n<p>Since people usually make commitments at work to get particular things done, they pretty much have to work long enough to get those things done, so even if someone take Tuesday morning off to walk to the voting booth, they are increasing their probability of working late a future week.</p>\n<p>In addition, since many volunteer activities more closely resemble recreation than work, they may not only funge mostly against recreation time, but have the same positive effects as recreation. \u00a0That is, if I take two weeks off of work to donate a kidney, I may return to work more rested and productive than if I had worked those two weeks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Adding_it_Up\">Adding it Up</strong></p>\n<p>Say that I earn on average $100 per hour worked, and I\u2019m considering taking on some volunteer activity. \u00a0If I assume that I can earn in a marginal hour half of what I do in an average hour, and if I work an extra hour that I\u2019ll donate half of the proceeds, and that the volunteer activity I\u2019m considering funges half against work and half against other non-work activities, then the amount I expect my donation to decrease by is not $100/hour, it\u2019s $12.50/hour. \u00a0This order of magnitude difference could easily make the difference between \u201cworth it\u201d activities and \u201cnot worth it\u201d ones.</p>\n<p>More importantly, though, how a particular time commitment affects your earnings depends a lot on the situation. \u00a0Every time we make this type of comparison, we\u2019re making assumptions. \u00a0Mine are more explicit, and I think they\u2019re more realistic, but even so they only apply to some situations. \u00a0Someone with a flexible job taking on a small time commitment is likely to have their earnings change by essentially zero. \u00a0Someone who is paid by the hour who has to trade their shift away to meet a new commitment probably loses essentially their full wages for that hour. \u00a0No single number comparison will capture all or even most situations.</p>\n<p>All this somewhat begs the question, though-- how should we manage the trade-off between work and other potentially impactful activities? \u00a0It seems like for most people, working and donating a portion of their salaries is the most impactful thing they can do, and it seems likely that working harder is a path to being able to donate more. \u00a0It also seems likely that many of us are at risk of overcommitting to volunteer activities to the point where they do interfere substantially with our jobs. \u00a0I think we can do better than naive hour-by-hour comparisons for understanding time tradeoffs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Better_Models_for_Time_Tradeoffs\">Better Models for Time Tradeoffs</h2>\n<p>Instead of comparing the uses of every hour individually, people trying to maximize their earnings should have policies for how they<span> </span>spend their time. \u00a0A simple and good example is a budget. \u00a0I might commit to spending 50 hours/week on work (or on investing in work skills), 10 hours/week on other EA related activities, and use the rest of my time how I want. \u00a0Using this system would allow me to still do activities that I want to do (voting, volunteering) in my free time, and feel confident that I\u2019m still doing a good job at work and investing in future earnings. \u00a0If I overspend in one category, I can consider it a loan from the future, and pay it back later.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Understanding_counterfactual_use_of_time\">Understanding counterfactual use of time</strong></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve said that when deciding to spend time on something, it doesn\u2019t make sense to assume that in the counterfactual, that same time would be used for work. \u00a0However, I don't have a high-certainty idea of what I would do in the counterfactual. \u00a0Budgeting time gives us the opportunity to be able to answer that question better.</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re considering modifying a budget to add an ongoing time commitment, you can compare two plans directly, and be able to make claims with reasonable certainty about what you would do in the counterfactual if you don\u2019t take on a commitment.</p>\n<p>Jeff Kaufman wrote about <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/keeping-choices-donation-neutral\">keeping monetary choices donation neutral</a>\u00a0(they also mention how they would approach some time tradeoffs).</p>\n<p>For many of us, donating money is going to be the most effective thing we do by a noticeable margin. \u00a0If this is true of you, this probably means putting work in its own category, since regularly choosing to do something besides work with your work time is probably not donation neutral. \u00a0If you don't think voting is an effective use of your time, but you still want to do it, go to the polls, but make sure you also meet your other time obligations for the week.</p>\n<p>This all leaves a question, though. \u00a0My initial criticism was of a way we communicate about time tradeoffs (making naive one-off-comparisons). \u00a0I\u2019ve talked about a better way for people to frame their decisions about how they spend their time, but I\u2019ve still deprived them of a catchy way to demonstrate the relative impact of different activities.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Better_Ways_to_Talk_about_Time_Use\">Better Ways to Talk about Time Use</strong></p>\n<p>Overall, I\u2019d rather see the impact of different activities compared to money than to time. \u00a0While the good different people can do with an hour may vary from person to person, the good they can do with a dollar can\u2019t, so dollars makes a better currency for impact than time. \u00a0I also think comparing the impact of an activity to the impact of a donation is similarly vivid--Scott Alexander uses in very well in <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/19/nobody-is-perfect-everything-is-commensurable/\">this recent post</a> to make the same point.</p>\n<p>I also think it\u2019s also reasonable to categorize an activity as \"not very effective.\" \u00a0I think the examples of soup kitchen work and voting both count as good things that are far enough from being effective we should probably never call them EA activities. \u00a0This doesn\u2019t mean you should never do them, only that you shouldn\u2019t put them in your \"altruism\" budget.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I think there\u2019s a larger pattern that\u2019s worth pointing out here. \u00a0Ben wrote about how the idea of <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/advantage\">comparative advantage causes no one in the movement to do things that need to be done</a>. \u00a0Even though every individual career decision may make sense, in the context of the EA movement they fail to meet some needs. \u00a0Similarly, making decisions about how to spend our time without context causes us to allocate our time in ways that aren\u2019t as valuable as we\u2019re portraying them.</p>\n<p>I think there\u2019s a tendency to discover a useful tool for thinking about how we should behave, and then apply it with insufficient scrutiny to too many situations. \u00a0We should spend more time stepping back and investigating the actual results of our decision-making algorithms, and looking for algorithms that result in states that we are happier with.</p>\n<div><br></div></div></div>"},
{"date": "9th Sep 2014", "title": "The Moral Imperative Towards Cost-effectiveness", "author": "Introduction", "num_comments": "13 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>by Toby Ord, originally on the <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/moral_imperative.pdf\">Giving What We Can</a> website</em></p>\n<p>Cost-effectiveness is one of the most morally important issues in global health. This claim will be surprising to many, since conversations about the ethics of global health usually focus on more traditional moral issues such as justice, equality, and freedom. While these issues are also important, they are often overshadowed by cost-effectiveness. In this note, I shall explain how this happens and what it means for global health.</p>\n<h1 id=\"The_cost_effectiveness_landscape_in_global_health\">The cost-effectiveness landscape in global health</h1>\n<p>The importance of cost-effectiveness is due to the fact that it varies so much between different interventions. Let us start with a simplified example to show how this becomes a moral consideration. Suppose we have a $40,000 budget which we can spend as we wish to fight blindness. One thing we could do is to provide guide dogs to blind people in the United States to help them overcome their disability. This costs about $40,000 due to the training required for the dog and its recipient.[1] Another option is to pay for surgeries to reverse the effects of trachoma in Africa. This costs less than $20 per patient cured.[2] There are many other options, but for simplicity, let us just consider these two.</p>\n<p>We could thus use our entire budget to provide a single guide dog, helping one person overcome the challenges of blindness, or we could use it to cure more than 2,000 people of blindness. If we think that people have equal moral value, then the second option is more than 2,000 times better than the first. Put another way, the first option squanders about 99.95% of the value that we could have produced.</p>\n<p>This example illustrates the basic point, but it is also unrealistic in a couple of ways. Firstly, it is rare for treatments in the United States to be traded off against treatments elsewhere. A health budget is normally more restricted than this, with a constraint that it is only spent on people in a particular rich country, or only spent on people in a designated category of poor countries. Secondly, we often have a spectrum of options. Thirdly, and most importantly, the class of interventions under consideration is often broad enough that it is difficult to make direct \u2018apples to apples\u2019 comparisons between the effects of two interventions.</p>\n<p>Health economists and moral philosophers have an answer to the third of these issues. They use measures of health benefits that are powerful enough to be able to compare the values any two health benefits. The standard measure in global health is the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY). This measures the disvalue of health conditions in terms of the number of years of life lost due to the condition plus the number of years lived with disability multiplied by a number representing the severity of the disability. For example, a condition that caused one to die 5 years prematurely and to live the last 10 years with deafness would be valued as 5 + (10 x 33.3%) = 8.33 DALYs.</p>\n<p>There are a number of complications and choices regarding the calculation of DALYs, which given rise to a number of subtly different versions of DALYs and the closely related units called QALYs. Chief among these is the question of the size of the weightings representing how bad it is on average to suffer from a particular disability. There are also considerations about discount rates and age weightings.</p>\n<p>Different reasonable choices on these parameters could change the number of DALYs due to a condition by a few percent or by as much as a factor of two. DALYs should thus be considered only as a rough measure of the disvalue of different conditions. It might seem that there would be little use for so rough a measure. This would be true if the difference in cost-effectiveness between interventions were also about a factor of two, but since it is often a factor of a hundred or more, a rough measure is perfectly adequate for making the key comparisons.</p>\n<p>Let us now address all of the three concerns, by looking at a real world example of funding the prevention or treatment of HIV and AIDS. Let us consider four intervention types: surgical treatment for Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (an AIDS defining illness), antiretroviral therapy to fight the virus in infected people, prevention of transmission of HIV from mother to child during pregnancy, condom distribution to prevent transmission more generally, and education for high risk groups such as sex workers. It is initially very unclear which of these interventions would be best to fund, and one might assume that they are roughly equal in importance. However, the most comprehensive compendium on cost-effectiveness in global health, Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries 2nd edition (hereafter DCP2), lists their estimated cost-effectiveness as follows:[3]</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3A72aco.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Note the wide discrepancies between the effectiveness of each intervention type. Treatment for Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma cannot be seen on the chart at this scale, but that says more about the other interventions being good than about this treatment being bad: treating Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma is considered cost-effective in a rich country setting. Antiretroviral therapy is estimated to be 50 times as effective as treatment of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma; prevention of transmission during pregnancy is 5 times as effective as this; condom distribution is about twice as effective as that; and education for high risk groups is about twice as effective again. In total, the best of these interventions is estimated to be 1,400 times as cost-effectiveness as the least good, or more than 1,400 times better than it would need to be in order to be funded in rich countries.</p>\n<p>This discrepancy becomes even larger if we make comparisons between interventions targeted at different types of illness. DCP2 includes cost-effectiveness estimates for 108 health interventions, which are presented in the chart below, arranged from least effective to most effective.[4]</p>\n<p>\u00a0<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/M2QsKkA.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This larger sample of interventions is even more disparate in terms of costeffectiveness. The least effective intervention analysed is still the treatment for Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, but there are also interventions up to ten times more cost-effective than education for high risk groups. In total, the interventions are spread over more than four orders of magnitude, ranging from 0.02 to 300 DALYs per $1,000, with a median of 5. Thus, moving money from the least effective intervention to the most effective would produce about 15,000 times the benefit, and even moving it from the median intervention to the most effective would produce about 60 times the benefit.</p>\n<p>It can also be seen that due to the skewed distribution, the most effective interventions produce a disproportionate amount of the benefits. According to the DCP2 data, if we funded all of these interventions equally, 80% of the benefits would be produced by the top 20% of the interventions.</p>\n<p>It must be noted that these are merely estimates of cost-effectiveness and there may be less variance between the real, underlying cost-effectiveness values. However, even if the most effective interventions are a tenth as effective as these figures suggest and the least effective are ten times better than they appear, there would still be a factor of 150 between them.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there have been health interventions that are even more effective than any of those studied in the DCP2. For example, consider the progress that has been made on saving lives lost to immunization preventable illness, diarrhea, malaria, and smallpox, summarized in the following chart:[5]</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/mYyw3ES.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In all cases, our interventions have led to at least 2.5 million fewer deaths per year. To aid the reader in comprehending the scale of these achievements, I have added a final bar showing the average number of deaths per year due to war and genocide together over the 20th Century (2.3 million). Thus, in each of the four of these disease areas, our health interventions save more lives than would be saved by a lasting world peace.</p>\n<p>Moreover, these gains have been achieved very cheaply. For instance in the case of smallpox, the total cost of eradication was about $400 million.[6] Since more than 100 million lives have been saved so far, this has come to less than $4 per life saved \u2014 significantly superior to all interventions in the DCP2. Moreover, the eradication also saved significant amounts of money. Approximately $70 million was being spent across developing countries per year in routine vaccination and treatment for smallpox, and more than $1,000 million was lost per year in reduced productivity.[7] Even just in the United States, smallpox vaccination and vigilance cost $150 million per year before eradication.8 The eradication programme thus saved more lives per year than are lost due to war, while saving money for both donors and recipients, paying back its entire costs every few months. It serves as an excellent proof of just how cost-effective global health can be.</p>\n<h1 id=\"The_moral_case\">The moral case</h1>\n<p>In these examples, we have seen how incredibly variable cost-effectiveness can be within global health. The least effective intervention in the HIV/AIDS case produces less than 0.1% of the value of the most effective, and if we are willing to look at different kinds of disease, this fraction drops to less than 0.01%. Ignoring costeffectiveness thus does not mean losing 10% or 20% of the potential value that a health budget could have achieved, but can easily mean losing 99% or more. Even choosing the median intervention can involve losing 85% of the potential value.</p>\n<p>In practical terms, this can mean hundreds, thousands, or millions of additional deaths due to failure to prioritize. In non-life-saving contexts it means thousands or millions of people with untreated disabling conditions.</p>\n<p>Even when other ethical issues in global health are very important in absolute terms, they are typically much smaller than this. For instance, it may be worse on equity grounds to treat a million people in a relatively affluent city than to treat the same number of people spread between the city and the relatively much poorer rural areas. However, it is not vastly worse \u2014 not so bad that 99% of the value is lost.</p>\n<p>Learning how to correctly factor these other ethical issues into our decision making is an important and challenging problem, but we are currently failing at a much more basic, more obvious, and more important problem: choosing to help more people instead of fewer people, to produce a larger health benefit instead of a smaller one.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Challenges_addressed\">Challenges addressed</h1>\n<p>Some people don\u2019t see cost-effectiveness as an ethical issue at all, since it is so cut and dried that it seems like a mere implementation issue. This is misguided. People who decide how to spend health budgets hold the lives or livelihoods of many other people in their hands. They are literally making life-or-death decisions. Most decisions of this sort take dramatically insufficient account of cost-effectiveness. As a result, thousands or millions of people die who otherwise would have lived. The few are saved at the expense of the many. It is typically done out of ignorance about the significance of the cost-effectiveness landscape rather than out of prejudice, but the effects are equally serious.</p>\n<p>Some object that consequences are not the only thing that matters. For example, some people think that acting virtuously or avoiding violating rights matters too. However, all plausible ethical theories hold that consequences are an important input into moral decision-making, particularly when considering life or death situations, or those affecting thousands of people. Indeed these are precisely the types of cases in which people think that it may even become permissible to violate rights. However, in the cases under consideration, there is not even a conflict between producing a much greater good and acting virtuously or avoiding violating people\u2019s rights. The consequences are thus of great moral importance, with no serious moral factors counting in the opposite direction. Proponents of all ethical theories should therefore agree about the moral importance of funding the most costeffective interventions.</p>\n<p>People might also be concerned about the particular choices involved in estimating the benefits of different health interventions. For example, they may disagree about particular disability weights, or about the method for eliciting these weights, or about discounting health benefits, or weighting benefits depending on the age of the recipients, or whether other issues such as equality need to be factored in. However, none of this is in serious disagreement with the thrust of this note. Indeed I personally have many of the same concerns, but as mentioned earlier the practical choices we face often involve factors of ten or more between different interventions, so none of the modifications mentioned here will change the rankings very much. People who are concerned about the details of measuring cost-effectiveness should join with the cost-effectiveness community in improving these measures, rather than throwing out the baby with the bathwater, and leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths.</p>\n<p>Another reason people might be initially suspicious of prioritisation based on cost-effectiveness is through confusing it with cost-benefit analysis (CBA). The latter is an economic method for prioritisation which involves determining the benefits for each person in terms of how many dollars they would be willing to pay, adding these up, and then dividing by the total costs in order to produce a benefit-cost ratio in units of dollars per dollar. This method is ethically suspect as it considers benefits to wealthy people (or groups) to be worth more than comparable benefits to poorer people (or groups) since the wealthy are willing to pay more for a given benefit.</p>\n<p>However, the cost-effectiveness I have discussed in this note is very different, and is a type of analysis known as cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). This doesn\u2019t convert benefits into dollars, but just provides a raw measure of the benefits in units such as DALYs per dollar, or lives saved per dollar. Thus the wealth of the recipients is not an input to the analysis and it doesn\u2019t discriminate towards interventions that favour the wealthy.</p>\n<p>People might remain suspicious of cost-effectiveness since it makes a connection between dollars and health (or even life itself). Making trade-offs between so-called sacred values such as life with non-sacred values such as money strikes many people as morally problematic. However, no such trade-off is made in cost-effectiveness analysis. Instead there is a budget constraint of some fixed number of dollars. The cost-effectiveness ratios help one to see how much benefit could be causally produced if this money were spent on different interventions \u2014 for example, saving one thousand lives or saving ten thousand lives. The only comparison that is made is between these benefits. Whether or not it is worth spending the budget to save ten thousand lives is not part of the analysis.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Conclusions\">Conclusions</h1>\n<p>In many cases ignoring cost-effectiveness in global health means losing almost all the value that we could create. Thus there is a moral imperative to fund the most costeffective interventions. This doesn\u2019t simply mean implementing the current interventions in the most cost-effective way possible, for the improvements that can be gained within a single intervention are quite small in comparison. It also doesn\u2019t just mean doing retrospective measures of the cost-effectiveness of the interventions you fund as part of programme evaluation. Instead, it means actively searching the landscape of interventions that you are allowed to fund and diverting the bulk of the funds to the very best interventions. Ideally it also means expanding the domain of interventions under consideration to include all those which have been analysed.</p>\n<p>The main effect of understanding the moral imperative towards cost-effectiveness is spending our budgets so as to produce greater health benefits, saving many more lives and preventing or treating more disabling conditions. However, it also shows a very interesting fact about global health funding. If we can save one thousand lives with one intervention and ten thousand with another at an equal price, then merely moving our funding from the first to the second saves nine thousand lives. Thus merely moving funding from one intervention to a more cost-effective one can produce almost as much benefit as adding an equal amount of additional funding.</p>\n<p>This is unintuitive since it isn\u2019t the case when one option is merely 10% or 30% better than another. However, when one option is 10 times or 100 times better, as is often the case in global health, redirecting funding is so important that it is almost as good as adding new funding directly towards the superior intervention. In times of global austerity and shrinking budgets, it is good to know how much more can be done within existing ones.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Endnotes_\">Endnotes:</h1>\n<p>[1]: Guide Dogs of America estimate $19,000 for the training of the dog.

year, I've been doing three month personal reviews (<a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/personal-review-for-december-2013-february-2014/\">Dec '13 - Feb '14</a>, <a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/personal-review-for-march-may-2014/\">March-May</a>, <a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/personal-review-for-may-june-2014/\">May-June</a>) to track my progress against my EA goals. \u00a0In this model, I review what I have done over the past three months, where it has gotten me, and then reflect upon it. \u00a0In doing this review, I hope to be not all that different from the three month review of any other EA org, except I'm an EA org of precisely one person.<br><br>Hopefully, posting such a review here is useful as a case-study of a particular effective altruist approach, and you might find something useful in it, or have some useful commentary to offer me. \u00a0I'd also love to see some of these from other people. \u00a0(Just sayin'.)</p>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2 id=\"General_Philosophy\">General Philosophy</h2>\n<p>The overall idea is that I self-identify as an effective altruist and want to make sure that a large bulk of my time is spent on some sort of personally optimal path to EA impact goodness.</p>\n<p>More broadly, I've recently taken to heart the idea that since I am pretty young and don't yet have a good idea of what my talents can get me and what my options are, I should try to do a wide variety of things that seem like they could be useful down the road, and then assess them later. \u00a0One could think of this as the \"explore\" mode of an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit\">\"explore-exploit\" model</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"How_Did_I_Spend_My_Time_\">How Did I Spend My Time?</h2>\n<p>On 27 Jul 2014, I switched to <a href=\"https://www.toggl.com/\">Toggl</a> from Google Calendar for my time tracking of choice (more notes on productivity forthcoming). \u00a0This means I now have much finer-grained time data, potentially down to the minute, though there are some inaccuracies. \u00a0Here is how I spent my time over August and September.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Project</th><th>Total</th><th>Per Week[1]</th><th>%

but not eating food.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"What_Did_I_Accomplish_\">What Did I Accomplish?</h2>\n<p><em>My Day Job</em></p>\n<p>Besides sleeping, I spent the next most largest amount of time on my day job.</p>\n<p>This job is full-time, and supposed to be 40hrs a week or more. \u00a0The reason why this appears as under 30hrs a week over the two months is because (a) I took one week off for vacation and (b) working 8 hours of day is actually very difficult. \u00a0What I mean by this is that when I use Toggl, any distraction -- to read Reddit, eat food, go to the bathroom, no matter how brief -- is counted as something other than work. \u00a0This means that I regularly spend ten hours a day in the office, but only get about 7 hours of actual work done. \u00a0...If someone is coming in at 9am and leaving by 5pm, they're certainly not working an actual 40 hour week. \u00a0Run a timer for yourself, and you'll be amazed by what I mean.</p>\n<p>At my last three month review, I was just starting as a Software Engineer Intern, and had not done any actual work yet. \u00a0In the past three months, I have successfully completed my internship, been hired as a permanent Software Engineer, and then transferred to become a Data Scientist. \u00a0In doing so, I learned a lot more about computer programming and a lot more about data science.</p>\n<p>I think my job has been the most valuable for the immense amount of learning. \u00a0With my day job and another ~9 hours a week of additional programming training, I think it's not an exaggeration to suggest that my programming knowledge has more than doubled, even though I only went from 700hrs of programming work to ~1100hrs of programming work. \u00a0Having mentorship is pretty useful. \u00a0I strengthened my knowledge of Ruby on Rails and R, and added knowledge in Coffeescript, Angular, Knockout, Mongo, Express, Node.js, VimScript, and Shell script.</p>\n<p>Also, my day job has afforded me the ability to donate more than $3K to date, and save even more than that to donate later.</p>\n<div><address>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Entrepreneurship</p>\n<p><span>As an off-shoot to learning how to program, I've started working on a few \"passive income\"\u00a0entrepreneurship\u00a0projects -- the kinds of projects that I hope will bring in some additional money, but not require too much maintenance. \u00a0I think doing projects like these is good for (a) building programming skills, (b) building management/entrepreneurship\u00a0skills that may be valuable if I want to work on start-ups later, (c) building career capital, and (d) potentially earning more money.</span></p>\n<p><span>So I compiled a list of ideas and got to 54 of them. \u00a0Many of them sucked, but I got to work on a few of them that I thought might not suck that much.</span></p>\n<p><span>The first project I launched was <a href=\"http://64or32.com/\">64or32.com</a>, which is a website that tells you what type of processor your computer is (64-bit or 32-bit). \u00a0The website contains an ad, which has made ~$8 to date. \u00a0Not quite enough to cover the $10 of domain costs or the ~5 hours of programming time, but still a good start in that I have officially made money online and learned a bit.</span></p>\n<p><span>I have a couple more ideas for ad-supported websites that I want to launch that might go live in the future, but ultimately I'd like to get away from that and toward other monetization models. \u00a0I hope by the next review I'll be announcing the launch of some much meatier ideas that are currently in the works, and more than $8 in revenue.</span></p>\n<p><span>But currently, like all great companies, I am in the red.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p>Direct EA Work</p>\n<p><span>One of my main career goals since I started thinking about careers has always been to keep a careful eye toward whether I'd be more valuable doing direct work.</span></p>\n<p><span>So far, I've experimented with 13 different EA projects. \u00a0I hope to pare this down significantly to the top performers soon, as I don't have </span>that <span>much time to spend on these projects.</span></p>\n</address><ul>\n<li><span><strong>Charity Science: </strong><a href=\"http://charityscience.com/\">Charity Science</a> is the EA org being run by Joey Savoie, Xio Kikauka, and Tom Ash that aims to fundraise for GiveWell top charities. \u00a0So far they've raised a good bit of money. \u00a0I've been helping them out with strategy.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>The Birthday for Charity Project: </strong>One of Charity Science's fundraising campaigns has been to encourage EAs to <a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/birthday-fundraisers.html\">raise money for their birthdays</a>. \u00a0This has been a surprisingly good value for a very small amount of time. \u00a0All my work on this project sums to 2.5 hours, and the project has brought in nearly $9K. \u00a0Split that among four people, and it's still $900/hr. I don't think I've ever had returns that good before.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>EA Survey Data Analysis: </strong>Back in May, .impact launched <a

almost finished. \u00a0Expect results by the end of the month.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>A Study of Facebook Veg Ads: </strong>I'm working to study the effectiveness of vegetarian

helped a bit with putting that together, but it was nearly entirely the work of Tom Ash.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>This EA Forum: </strong>I helped a bit with advising Ryan Carey on

with atheists and humanists in Vancouver. \u00a0I went to the Chicago Skeptics Meetup to see if I could do the same thing. \u00a0I only have been able to go once, so results are inconclusive, but I found another EA there and convinced him to sign up with Giving What We Can, so it didn't go all that badly. \u00a0I'm interested in going more, if just for social reasons.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Animal Rights Protesting:</strong> <a href=\"http://directactioneverywhere.com/\">Direct Action Everywhere</a> came to Chicago, so I went out to try out animal rights protesting and see what it's all about. \u00a0It's exceedingly difficult to figure out if my participation had any value, but it was fun and a good way to expand my own comfort zone. \u00a0More notes on this are forthcoming.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<p><span>I'm still not very clear on my value as a EA direct worker, relative to my value as a programmer / entrepreneur who can move money to direct workers. \u00a0I think there has been a ton of value in having very high engagement with EA orgs that I donate with, however, and direct work has really helped with this.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n</div>\n<p>Moving</p>\n<p>In my previous review, I spent a lot of time moving again, switching to my second apartment. \u00a0I think this was worth it, as I cut my rent down by $255/month (Chicago is expensive) and cut my commute down by 20 minutes a day (valued at $400/month) for a place I consider just as good (better in some aspects, worse in others). \u00a0I expect it to be more than three months or more before I move again, so the 30 hours spent will ultimately get me ~$65/hour in value. \u00a0Though moving is pretty stressful and I don't want to do it too often.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sleep, Break, and Social</p>\n<p><span>Sleep is 8 hours a day, which I consider pretty typical. \u00a0I'm considering experimenting with different methods of sleeping less (e.g., naps, caffeine, </span>maaaybe <span>modafinil), but ultimately I'm pretty concerned that the desire to sleep less is a fallacy and actually I do more on 8 hours of sleep, since I'm well-rested enough to do good work.</span></p>\n<p>Time spent on break is higher than in the last review, but I see this mostly as an artifact of switching to Toggl, and therefore being able to penalize the short 2-10 minute breaks that I used to not count. \u00a0While I think it would be more productive to cut this down, I think I'm at a pretty ideal point in terms of my break amount and spacing. \u00a0While I don't want to break to excess, they are pretty important for restoring focus. \u00a0Like sleep, I think breaks may be underrated by people who are focused on productivity.</p>\n<p>Lastly, my social time continues to be quite high at 27 hours a week. \u00a0While down from the 37 hours a week of my summer time, it's not the focused 15 hours a week I achieved in February. \u00a0I'm excited, however, to make social connections here in Chicago, and think spending a large amount of time upfront making connections is pretty justified. \u00a0A lot of my social time is also spent with my girlfriend, who I like a lot. \u00a0Furthermore, I went on vacation for a week, went to Gen Con, and went to a college reunion, all three of which made social time larger than what would be normal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div>\n<p>Prepping, Planning, Email, Food, Cleaning, Errands, and Exercise</p>\n<p>It's nice to have Toggl now because my estimates for these activities will be much more active. \u00a0There's not a whole lot I have to comment on any of these. \u00a0Some people may be interested in how a lot of these times are so low, and I plan to offer more discussion about that at a later date. \u00a0(Though the reason why exercise is so low is because I've fallen off the exercise wagon a couple times, and I hope to have this be a larger amount by the next review.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p><span>I've been very excited about the rich variety of activities I've been able to partake in, from socializing to my day job to a rich life of EA and entrepreneurship projects. \u00a0However, I've also felt the cost of having my attention divided in too many places, and not being able to have enough time to focus on any individual thing to the degree that it deserves to really see it through.</span></p>\n<p><span>I've been experimenting with restructuring my schedule to find more time to do things, and have had a fair amount of success with this in the past week. \u00a0However, I think I'll soon be faced with the harsh reality that I'll just need to prioritize things and decide which things are providing the highest amount of value, and ruthlessly end the remainder. \u00a0I don't currently know yet which remainder to end, though.</span></p>\n<p><span>Ultimately, I'm still interested in whether I should continue my day job, or whether I should pursue independent work (either in entrepreneurship or in direct work), though I feel a lot less conflicted in this than I was a month ago. \u00a0I think that the day job is a good direction for me in terms of providing real skill building, good career capital, status, and the ability to donate.</span></p>\n<p><span>Three months ago, I was just moving into Chicago, having no idea what is ahead of me. \u00a0In many ways, things are different than they were in college, where I knew what I would be doing a year ahead. \u00a0Now, I'm not even sure where I'll be -- both physically and in terms of my beliefs about what my future should be -- by my next review.</span></p>\n<p><span>I think the wisdom of keeping options open is very wise, and by my variety of activities, I think I've done this to it's fullest extent. \u00a0I've often found that I have no idea what value certain projects will have until I do them, and so -- until then -- I'll just continue to do.</span></p>\n<p><span>It's amazing how much you can get done if you just keep on doing things.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>"},
{"date": "14th Oct 2014", "title": "Giving Without Sacrifice? (Some excerpts) ", "author": "Andreas_Mogensen", "num_comments": "1 comment", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>(You can find the complete paper <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/giving-without-sacrifice.pdf\">on the GWWC website</a>)</p>\n<p>Cross-sectional studies consistently show that at any given time, within any given country, income is positively correlated with happiness (see [Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener 2002, 122-127] for overview and discussion). Thus, the World Value Survey II found the percentage of respondents in the UK reporting above neutral life-satisfaction to be 19% higher for high income groups compared to low income groups; in France the di\ufb00erence was 29%, in the Netherlands it was 6%, and the global average was 17%<sup>1</sup>\u2026</p>\n<p>What, if anything, can we conclude from this regarding the probable e\ufb00ects of giving away 10% of our income? We might choose to think of this as equivalent to simply exchanging our level of happiness for that attributed by a cross-sectional survey to someone within our country whose income is 10% lower than our own. Since we know that income is positively correlated with happiness in cross-sectional surveys, we should then expect that the e\ufb00ect of donating our income will be to decrease happiness.</p>\n<p>However, we must be careful in inferring causation from correlation. The existence of a positive correlation between happiness and income might be partly due, for example, to the in\ufb02uence of happiness on income: people of a cheerful disposition might end up wealthier than others. In fact, an e\ufb00ect of this kind exists<sup>2</sup>. Similarly, the correlation between income and happiness might be partly due to any number of third variables that cause both higher income and higher happiness. And, in fact, the correlation between income and happiness is weakened if one controls for variables such as education and unemployment<sup>3</sup>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On top of this, it might be argued that the available data in\ufb02ates the size of the correlation between income and happiness. In surveys of this correlation, wellbeing is almost always measured by asking subjects to provide global reports of life-satisfaction: for example, they may be asked, \u201cAll things considered, how satis\ufb01ed are you with your life as a whole these days?\u201d However, there exists another technique for measuring happiness, experiential sampling, where subjects are asked to report their instantaneous feelings of happiness or unhappiness at several points over an extended period of time. It has been argued that experiential sampling provides a superior method of measuring happiness, because it overcomes the biases and imperfections associated with the cognitive capacities required to provide an accurate estimate of the happiness associated with ones life as a whole<sup>4,5</sup>. The choice of method is of importance, because the correlation between income and happiness is weakened by the replacement of such experiential measures for global self-report measures<sup>6,7</sup>. If experiential sampling provides a more objective measure of wellbeing, then money buys less happiness than most studies indicate.</p>\n<p>Since giving away 10% of ones income involves only the loss of money and no sacri\ufb01ce of ones educational achievement or sunny disposition, giving away 10% of ones income will not produce as great a drop in happiness as would exchanging ones level of wellbeing for that of a typical person earning 10% less, as people who earn di\ufb00erent amounts of money typically di\ufb00er in other ways which are relevant to happiness. On top of this, it must be emphasized that the data shows the correlation between income and happiness to be small, and signi\ufb01cantly smaller than people estimate<sup>8</sup>. Based on Helliwell<sup>9</sup>, Layard<sup>10</sup> calculates that \u201c[a] fall in income by one third (holding national income constant) causes a fall in happiness of 2 points on the scale of happiness (from 10 to 100).\u201d (65, my emphasis) The modest size of the correlation ensures that the e\ufb00ects of income on happiness are dwarfed by other non-pecuniary factors. On one analysis of their data, Ball &amp; Chernova<sup>11</sup> calculate that for the median single individual, the happiness boost produced by marriage is matched only by a 767% increase in absolute income, or by an increase in relative income from the 50th to the 88th percentile; the boost associated with moving from a health rating of 3 to 4 (when health is scored from 1 to 5) is matched only by a 6,531% increase in absolute income, or by a move from the 50th to the 100th percentile in relative income.</p>\n<p>Supposing, then, that we adopt the approach suggested above and think of donating 10% of our income as equivalent to simply exchanging our level of happiness for that attributed by a cross-sectional survey to someone within our country whose income is 10% lower than our own (keeping all other variables constant), we may conclude that this should produce a very small reduction in personal happiness.</p>\n<p>However, the methodology relied upon here is open to challenge. We might ask why we should think of giving away 10% of our income as equivalent to earning 10% less? After all, that assumption is literally false: we will not have a lower income, but one that is spent di\ufb00erently\u2026</p>\n<p>To determine the probable e\ufb00ects of donating our income we should examine empirical studies that address the correlation between di\ufb00erent kinds of spending and happiness, rather than the correlation between income and happiness.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, relatively little research has explored this issue, though it has gained increasing attention of late (see Dunn, Gilbert, &amp; Wilson in press for an overview). Certain important results have already been established: for example, spending money on experiences, such as holiday trips, typically yields greater happiness than spending money on material goods<sup>12</sup>. There is also evidence to indicate that bene\ufb01tting others might bene\ufb01ts us more than spending money on ourselves.</p>\n<p>Imagine the following scenario. You are a participant in a psychological experiment: you are given an envelope containing a small sum of money, which you are asked to spend within 24 hours. The experimenter can assign you to one of conditions: she can require that you spend the money on yourself (paying a bill or buying yourself a treat) or she can require that you spend the money on others (buying a present for someone or donating the money to charity). Which condition do you suppose would bring the greatest happiness: spending the windfall on yourself or in an altruistic fashion?</p>\n<p>If you are like the typical participant in an experiment of this kind, conducted by Dunn, Aknin, &amp; Norton<sup>13</sup>, you believe that spending on yourself brings greater happiness. If you are of this opinion, your a\ufb00ective forecast is mistaken: the experimenters found that subjects in the prosocial spending condition reported greater happiness after spending their windfall than did those in the personal spending condition. This was not an isolated result. Dunn et al. also conducted a longitudinal study of 16 employees at a Boston- based company who received a pro\ufb01t-sharing bonus, \ufb01nding that those who devoted more of their bonus to prosocial spending experienced greater happiness as a result of spending their windfall; a cross-sectional study of a representative sample of Americans also found greater prosocial spending correlated with signi\ufb01cantly greater happiness, while personal spending turned out to be unrelated to happiness.</p>\n<p>Aknin et al.<sup>14</sup> examined survey-data from 136 countries gathered by the Gallup Organization, to see whether ratings of subjective wellbeing were positively correlated with donating to charity. Controlling for household income, it was found, in 122 of the 136 countries, that there is a positive correlation between subjective wellbeing and answering Yes to the question Have you donated money to charity in the last month? On average, it was found, \u201cdonating to charity has a similar relationship to S[ubjective]W[well]B[eing] as a doubling of household income.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course, we must be cautious in extrapolating from these results to the conclusion that donating 10% of our income to charity will be better for us than would be keeping this money for ourselves. The Gallup data did not assess the amount given to charity, and is correlational. The sums involved in the experiment described above are small. The experiment also involved windfall gains, such that subjects were not using money that they had already planned to spend on themselves. Moreover, insofar as the e\ufb00ects of donating 10% of our income might be expected to resemble those achieved for the prosocial spenders in the experiment described above, it is important that this 10% be taken from spending that would otherwise have gone on ourselves: the experiment does not support the view that giving money to charity is better than not giving, if the money donated would instead have been spent on presents for friends or family. Nonetheless, these results lend credence to the idea that giving money to charity can be a source of life-satisfaction that outweighs whatever minor frustrations we might experience from having less money to spend for our own purposes. Anecdotally, this idea is borne out by the testimony of members of Giving What We Can. Far from feeling like a sacri\ufb01ce, joining Giving What We Can tends to be a very positive experience, as you become part of a global community of like-minded individuals and gain deep satisfaction from the knowledge that you are helping others and making a positive impact on the world.</p>\n<p>It must be conceded that we have not been able to arrive at any secure verdict regarding the expected e\ufb00ects of donating 10% of our income to charity. Nonetheless, we have uncovered good evidence to support the view that this will involve no great sacri\ufb01ce on our behalf, and certainly less sacri\ufb01ce than we initially expected\u2026</p>\n<p>Ultimately, of course, the important thing is to help others. Given the extraordinary bene\ufb01ts that we can achieve for individuals living in poverty, it is something we should be doing even if did mean a real sacri\ufb01ce. But it is important to know that it does not, for we can then put to rest whatever self-interested doubts might be holding us back.</p>\n<p>Endnotes:</p>\n<p>1.

{"date": "4th Jul 2014", "title": "The timing of labour aimed at reducing existential risk", "author": "Toby_Ord2", "num_comments": "6 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>Crossposted from the <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/the-timing-of-labour-aimed-at-reducing-existential-risk\">Global Priorities Project</a></em></p><p>Work towards reducing existential risk is likely to happen over a timescale of decades. For many parts of this work, the benefits of that labour is greatly affected by when it happens. This has a large effect when it comes to strategic thinking about what to do now in order to best help the overall existential risk reduction effort. I look at the effects of nearsightedness, course setting, self-improvement, growth, and serial depth, showing that there are competing considerations which make some parts of labour particularly valuable earlier, while others are more valuable later on. We can thus improve our overall efforts by encouraging more meta-level work on course setting, self-improvement, and growth over the next decade, with more of a focus on the object-level research on specific risks to come in decades beyond that.\n</p><h2 id=\"Nearsightedness\">Nearsightedness</h2>\nSuppose someone considers AI to be the largest source of existential risk, and so spends a decade working on approaches to make self-improving AI safer. It might later become clear that AI was not the most critical area to worry about, or that this part of AI was not the most critical part, or that this work was going to get done anyway by mainstream AI research, or that working on policy to regulate research on AI was more important than working on AI. In any of these cases she wasted some of the value of her work by doing it now. She couldn't be faulted for lack of omniscience, but she could be faulted for making herself unnecessarily at the mercy of bad luck. She could have achieved more by doing her work later, when she had a better idea of what was the most important thing to do.<p></p><p>We are nearsighted with respect to time. The further away in time something is, the harder it is to perceive its shape: its form, its likelihood, the best ways to get purchase on it. This means that work done now on avoiding threats in the far future can be considerably less valuable than the same amount of work done later on. The extra information we have when the threat is up close lets us more accurately tailor our efforts to overcome it.</p><p>Other things being equal, this suggests that a given unit of labour directed at reducing existential risk is worth more the later in time it comes.\n</p><h2 id=\"Course_setting__self_improvement___growth\">Course setting, self-improvement &amp; growth</h2>\nAs it happens, other things are not equal. There are at least three major effects which can make earlier labour matter more.<p></p><p>The first of these is if it helps to change course. If we are moving steadily in the wrong direction, we would do well to change our course, and this has a larger benefit the earlier we do so. For example, perhaps effective altruists are building up large resources in terms of specialist labour directed at combatting a particular existential risk, when they should be focusing on more general purpose labour. Switching to the superior course sooner matters more, so efforts to determine the better course and to switch onto it matter more the earlier they happen.</p><p>The second is if labour can be used for self-improvement. For example, if you are going to work to get a university degree, it makes sense to do this earlier in your career rather than later as there is more time to be using the additional skills. Education and training, both formal and informal, are major examples of self-improvement. Better time management is another, and so is gaining political or other influence. However this category only includes things that create a lasting improvement to your capacities and that require only a small upkeep. We can also think of self-improvement for an organisation. If there is benefit to be had from improved organisational efficiency, it is generally better to get this sooner. A particularly important form is lowering the risk of the organisation or movement collapsing, or cutting off its potential to grow.</p><p>The third is if the labour can be used to increase the amount of labour we have later. There are many ways this could happen, several of which give exponential growth. A simple example is investment. An early hour of labour could be used to gain funds which are then invested. If they are invested in a bank or the stock market, one could expect a few percent real return, letting you buy twice as much labour two or three decades later. If they are invested in raising funds through other means (such as a fundraising campaign) then you might be able to achieve a faster rate of growth, though probably only over a limited number of years until you are using a significant fraction of the easy opportunities.</p><p>A very important example of growth is movement building: encouraging other people to dedicate part of their own labour or resources to the common cause, part of which will involve more movement building. This will typically have an exponential improvement with the potential for double digit percentage growth until the most easily reached or naturally interested people have become part of the movement at which point it will start to plateau. An extra hour of labour spent on movement building early on, could very well produce a hundred extra hours of labour to be spent later. Note that there might be strong reasons not to build a movement as quickly as possible: rapid growth could involve increasing the signal to noise ratio in the movement, or changing its core values, or making it more likely to collapse, and this would have to be balanced against the benefits of growth sooner.</p><p>If the growth is exponential for a while but will spend a lot of time stuck at a plateau, it might be better in the long term to think of it like self improvement. An organisation might have been able to raise $10,000 of funds per year after costs before the improvement and then gains the power to raise $1,000,000 of funds per year afterwards -- only before it hits the plateau does it have the exponential structure characteristic of growth.</p><p>Finally, there is a matter of serial depth. Some things require a long succession of stages each of which must be complete before the next begins. If you are building a skyscraper, you will need to build the structure for one story before you can build the structure for the next. You will therefore want to allow enough time for each of these stages to be completed and might need to have some people start building soon. Similarly, if a lot of novel and deep research needs to be done to avoid a risk, this might involve such a long pipeline that it could be worth starting it sooner to avoid the diminishing marginal returns that might come from labour applied in parallel. This effect is fairly common in computation and labour dynamics (see The Mythical Man Month), but it is the factor that I am least certain of here. We obviously shouldn't hoard research labour (or other resources) until the last possible year, and so there is a reason based on serial depth to do some of that research earlier. But it isn't clear how many years ahead of time it needs to start getting allocated (examples from the business literature seem to have a time scale of a couple of years at most) or how this compares to the downsides of accidentally working on the wrong problem.\n</p><h2 id=\"Consequences\">Consequences</h2>\nWe have seen that nearsightedness can provide a reason to delay labour, while course setting, self-improvement, growth, and serial depth provide reasons to use labour sooner. In different cases, the relative weights of these reasons will change. The creation of general purpose resources such as political influence, advocates for the cause, money, or earning potential, is especially resistant to the nearsightedness problem as they have more flexibility to be applied to whatever the most important final steps happen to be. Creating general purpose resources, or doing course setting, self-improvement, or growth are thus comparatively better to do in the earlier times. Direct work on the cause is comparatively better to do later on (with a caveat about allowing enough time to allow for the required serial depth).<p></p><p>In the case of existential risk, I think that many of the percentage points of total existential risk lie decades or more in the future. There is quite plausibly more existential risk in the 22nd century than in the 21st. For AI risk, the recent FHI survey of 174 experts, the median estimate for when there would be a 50% chance of reaching roughly human level AI was 2040. For the subgroup of those who are part of the 'Top 100' researchers in AI, it was 2050. This gives something like 25 to 35 years before we think most of this risk will occur. That is a long time and will produce a large nearsightedness problem for conducting specific research now and a large potential benefit for course setting, self-improvement, and growth. Given a portfolio of labour to reduce risk over that time, it is particularly important to think about moving types of labour towards the times where they have a comparative advantage. If we are trying to convince others to help use their careers to reduce this risk, the best career advice might change over the coming decades from help with movement building or course setting, to accumulating more flexible resources, to doing specialist technical work.</p><p>The temporal location of a unit of labour can change its value by a great deal. It is quite plausible that due to nearsightedness, doing specific research now could have less than a tenth the expected value of doing it later, since it could so easily be on the wrong risk, or the wrong way of addressing the risk, or would have been done anyway, or could have been done more easily using tools people later build etc. It is also quite plausible that using labour to produce growth now, or to point us in a better direction, could produce ten times as much value. It is thus pivotal to think carefully about when we want to have different kinds of labour.</p><p>I think that this overall picture is right and important. However, I should add some caveats. We might need to do some specialist research early on in order to gain information about whether the risk is credible or which parts to focus on, to better help us with course setting. Or we might need to do research early in order to give research on risk reduction enough academic credibility to attract a wealth of mainstream academic attention, thereby achieving vast growth in terms of the labour that will be spent on the research in the future. Some early object level research will also help with early fundraising and movement building -- if things remain too abstract for a long time, it would be extremely difficult to maintain a movement. But in these examples, the overall picture is the same. If we want to do early object-level research, it is because of its instrumental effects on course setting, self-improvement, and growth.</p><p>The writing of this document and the thought that preceded it are an example of course setting: trying to significantly improve the value of the long-term effort in existential risk reduction by changing the direction we head in. I think there are considerable gains here and as with other course setting work, it is typically good to do it sooner. I've tried to outline the major systematic effects that make the value of our labour vary greatly with time, and to present them qualitatively. But perhaps there is a major effect I've missed, or perhaps some big gains by using quantitative models. I think that more research on this would be very valuable.</p></div></div>"},

They produce charity fundraising fandom music albums - which to date have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars. They recently moved their mission statement towards working on behalf of the most effective charity and launched a new Album <a href=\"http://broniesforgood.org/2014/12/last-reminder-shine-together-album-premiere-with-donation-matching/\">\"Seeds of Kindness: Shine Together\"</a>\u00a0 raising funds for the Against Malaria Foundation.

{"date": "9th Sep 2014", "title": "High Impact Science", "author": "Introduction", "num_comments": "7 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>by <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com.au/\">Carl Shulman</a>, originally from the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2011/11/high-impact-science/\">80,000 Hours Blog</a></em></p>\n<p>Paul Ehrlich began his 1968 book, The Population Bomb, with this statement:</p>\n<p>The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.</p>\n<p>Ehrlich predicted the deaths as a consequence of the challenge of feeding a rapidly growing world population, pointing to recent devastating famines in South Asia. But even as those words were written, the fields were being planted with new, higher-yielding semi-dwarf strains of wheat and rice. Combined with modern fertilizers and other methods, these strains ushered in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_revolution\">\u201cGreen Revolution\u201d</a>: wheat production in India and Pakistan almost doubled between 1965 and 1970, and formerly famine-wracked countries became self-sufficient in food and have not seen such hunger since. The agronomist Norman Borlaug, who developed new and more effective methods of plant breeding, used them to develop the key strain of wheat, and brought about expansion of his methods to other crops and deployment in South Asia, played a pivotal role.</p>\n<p>Some <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/01/forgotten-benefactor-of-humanity/6101/\">credit him</a> with saving a billion lives,\u00a0referring to the number of people fed by the increase agricultural production of the Green Revolution. Indisputably, scientific and technological advances and technological innovation have brought about almost incredible amounts of good.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8xmMDCF.jpg?1\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"Not_whether__but_when_\">Not whether, but when?</h1>\n<p>However, when we ask how we can effectively do good in our careers, the key question is not how much scientific research on the whole has made the world better: it is \u201chow do I expect the world to be different if I take up this career, rather than another one?\u201d If Norman Borlaug had never lived his discoveries would eventually have been made by others. Continued food scarcity would have evoked both market and government responses in increased research. Fertilizers and other agricultural technologies would have been applied without enhanced crop varieties, capturing some of the Green Revolution\u2019s benefits. We should think of achievements like Borlaug\u2019s as bringing about technologies faster, rather than making them possible at all.</p>\n<p>However, tremendous impacts are possible through speeding the pace of progress, even slightly. According to the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/malaria2010_summary_keypoints_en.pdf\">WHO</a>, malaria killed over 781,000 people in 2009. If current trends continue, advances in vaccines, bednets, mosquito control, and increased deployment efforts will likely eventually drive down fatalities to zero. But leaping ahead in this process by a single year could save 781,000 lives. A single day\u2019s speedup would save 2,139 lives. Advancing the process by even 40 seconds would save a life. Then the question becomes: how many seconds can you expect to advance your field over your career?</p>\n<p>Norman Borlaug advanced progress on a massive issue by years, a truly exceptional achievement that very likely saved millions of lives or more over time. But far more scientists, working on important but neglected problems, could each hope to do good comparable to moving malaria eradication forward several days. Such an achievement could do as much good as donating millions of pounds to apply existing vaccines or drugs.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How_much_can_I_advance_my_field_\">How much can I advance my field?</h1>\n<p>When we consider donating to administer treatments for tuberculosis or malaria, we can measure lives saved through randomized experiment: administer the treatment to half of a study population at random, and see how many more members of the vaccinated group remain healthy. Estimating the impact of individual research contributions is harder.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to measure inputs such as R&amp;D funding and scientific workforce. For instance, <a href=\"http://www.malariavaccine.org/files/RD-report-June2011.pdf\">spending on malaria</a> R&amp;D was $612 million in 2009, after doubling from 2004 levels thanks to increased spending by the Gates Foundation and United States NIAID. So one can fairly easily find out whether adding one\u2019s brain or donations to the field will boost the relevant inputs by 10% or by 0.01%, and rephrase questions about impact of additional researchers in terms of the speed increase from a percentage resource increase. Will doubling R&amp;D budgets cut development time by at least 10%? 2%? 0.2%? Phrased in this way, it is easier to draw on other knowledge to judge the plausibility of potential impacts.</p>\n<p>When a <a href=\"http://www.rethinkhiv.com/priorities/113-georgetown-university-expert-panel\">panel</a> convened by the <a href=\"http://www.rethinkhiv.com/priorities\">RethinkHIV</a> initiative, which performed cost-benefit analysis of a number of HIV/AIDS interventions, <a href=\"http://www.rethinkhiv.com/images/Papers/111118141329-ccc93b191d114d1fb9b1dd3cc7c49e5e.pdf\">turned to HIV vaccine research</a>, it consulted expert HIV researchers to estimate the\u00a0likelihood that vaccine development would be both successful and not preempted by substitutes. The cost of vaccine development was estimated based on the costs and frequency of past partially successful vaccine candidates. They then found very large benefits relative to costs from increasing annual R&amp;D spending from $900 million to $1 billion, provided that this increase would accelerate vaccine development by ~5 months (vs a baseline 20-30 year timeframe), so that vaccine research would outrank deployment of existing treatments in cost-effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Reasoning like this, taking into account the magnitude of potential gains in a field, the scale of inputs so far, track records in similar fields, expert judgment (with <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7959.html\">caveats</a>) and interim successes, can make a good start at deciding what research areas to bet on when trying to steer towards high impact.</p>\n<p>Opportunities for\u00a0high-impact science are present within a wide variety of fields, including not\u00a0only public health but also physics, mathematics, computer science, economics,\u00a0and many more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Part of\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/\">Introduction to Effective Altruism</a><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Previous:\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/4a/to_save_the_world_dont_get_a_job_at_a_charity_go/\">To Save the World, Don't Get a Job at a Charity, Go Work on Wall Street</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/ea/4a/to_save_the_world_dont_get_a_job_at_a_charity_go/\"></a>Next:\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/75/how_to_assess_the_impact_of_a_career/\">How to Assess the Impact of a Career</a></p>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>"},

What are everyone's thoughts on them? I'd be interested to hear from people who are planning to give to them, or have used ACE's research in the past.</p>\n<p>The Humane League and Mercy for Animals remain on the list, and are joined by Animal Equality. Like GiveWell, ACE has added a second tier of \"standout charities\" (they recently <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/thinking-upcoming-recommendations/\">discussed the pros &amp; cons of doing so</a> on their blog). This list contains the Humane Society of the United States\u2019 Farm Animal Protection Campaign, Farm Animal Rights Movement, Vegan Outreach, and the Albert Schweitzer Foundation. They have detailed reviews of each of these organisations.</p>\n<p>ACE have set a target of $150,000 in donations for their top three charities, but think that they could use about $1,070,000 in funding this year. So it looks like there's no shortage of room for more funding in the animal rights movement!</p>\n<p>It's worth thanking ACE for the great research work that they do. They need donations themselves to keep doing that work, and a generous donor has offered to <strong><a href=\"http://double.animalcharityevaluators.org/\">match donations to them</a></strong> until December 5th.</p>\n<p>Here is a summary of the top charities, taken from ACE's in depth reports:</p>\n<h2 id=\"ACE_s_top_charities\">ACE's top charities</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Animal_Equality\">Animal Equality</h3>\n<p>\"Animal Equality advocates for animals by conducting undercover investigations and promoting them through media outlets. They also conduct grassroots outreach, including demonstrations, protests, leafleting, and video showings. Related to their undercover investigations, they also conduct some legal and corporate outreach efforts.</p>\n<p>\"Animal Equality has branches in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Mexico, and India. We think their model of employing local activists to lead offices while coordinating actions internationally amplifies their effectiveness both by allowing them to present materials to more people and by directing resources to locations where they can be particularly effective.\"</p>\n<h3 id=\"The_Humane_League\">The Humane League</h3>\n<p>\"The Humane League (THL) works to reduce suffering of farm animals through conducting online advertising, organizing grassroots outreach, instigating cage-free and Meatless Monday campaigns, giving presentations, and engaging in corporate outreach. THL shows exceptional strength in their desire to test for effectiveness, as evidenced by their efforts with Humane League Labs, a program designed to evaluate advocacy presentation and methods. They also use the evidence they find to guide their efforts.</p>\n<p>\"THL employs a local model. We find their approach of continually adding local offices an intriguing method to increase their presence and impact, as they claim their new offices are self-sustaining in fundraising within two years of opening.\"</p>\n<h3 id=\"Mercy_For_Animals\">Mercy For Animals</h3>\n<p>\"Mercy for Animals (MFA) advocates for farm animals by conducting undercover investigations, engaging in corporate and legal outreach, running online vegetarian ads, and organizing grassroots outreach events. In particular, their undercover investigations show promise through the multi-faceted positive benefits stemming from their publication and sharing. MFA\u2019s professional presentation increases the likelihood of their success in all areas, and they test different arrangements of their materials to maximize impact. They show a willingness to change based on new evidence, and are continually refining their strategic approach in accordance with what seems most successful and cost-effective. We are proud to recognize MFA as one of our top charities.</p>\n<p>\"MFA is working to centralize their efforts, reducing the number of offices they have around the country and instead focusing more on investigations and online advocacy. Given their success and increased presence in advocacy, this move makes sense to us as a way to minimize costs and maximize impact.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"How_to_donate\"><a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/donations\"><img src=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/sites/effectivealtruismhub.com/media/images/specific-pages/donations-piggy-bank.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a>How to donate</h2>\n<p>The Humane League and Mercy For Animals are tax-deductible in the US, and you can claim GiftAid when giving to\u00a0Animal Equality in the UK. ACE <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/donate/donation-register/\">recommends</a> that people donating to effective animal charities <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/donations/past/add\">register their donations on the EA Donation Registry</a>, which also lets you report the influence of their research.</p></div></div>"},

I've pasted the main points Holden made here:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Personal_fit\">Personal fit</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p><p>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Your degree of \u201cfit\u201d with a role depends on your chances of ultimately excelling in the role if you work at hard at it, arising from the match between yourself and the requirements of the role.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Holden believes that if you want to make a difference, seeking out roles with which you have a high degree of fit should be a top priority, especially early in your career. This is because:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Fit is easier to judge than many other factors, such as how much immediate impact you have, which means it\u2019s easier to improve your degree of fit over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>It\u2019s harder to change your career \u2018role\u2019 than your cause later in your career. For instance, if you become a great salesperson, it\u2019s relatively easy to transition into an organisation that works on a different cause, but much harder to become great at some other skill. This means that early in your career it\u2019s more important to figure out what types of roles suit you than what cause to support early in your career.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>There\u2019s huge, robust benefits from being good at your job including (i) better career capital \u2013 \u201cit gives you a better learning experience, better personal development, better overall status, better overall opportunities\u201d \u2013 (ii) higher impact within your field.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Excelling at what you do is one of the most important rules of thumb for having more impact, partly because a lot of the world\u2019s impact comes from extreme cases, so your chances of being an extreme case may dominate your expected impact. In particular, extreme impact often arises from innovation \u2013 spotting ideas others haven\u2019t \u2013 and this is more likely when you\u2019re at the top of your field.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Some other criteria that are important early in your career are: (i) the general status of the option (ii) the pay (iii) how much you\u2019ll learn about yourself and your other options from taking this option.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Cause_selection\">Cause selection</strong></p>\n<p>\n</p><ul>\n<li>If a cause is on the Open Philanthropy Project\u2019s list, that\u2019s an extra reason to seek a job in that area.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>However, if a cause isn\u2019t on the list, it may still be promising, especially if you have good personal fit with the area. Personal fit may often overwhelm considerations about the general effectiveness of a cause.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>There can be other differences between the causes that are most promising for philanthropists and those that are most promising for job seekers. For instance, since OPP\u2019s causes are often constrained by a lack of money, it may be difficult to get a job within them.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Some ideas for causes OPP isn\u2019t investigating, but at first glance still look promising for job seekers include: environment and climate change, scientific research, for-profit work (especially in innovative areas), and foreign relations.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>OPP aren\u2019t highly likely to drastically change their list of causes (especially within global catastrophic risks and political advocacy) for at least two to three years.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If you want to make a difference in the for-profit world, avoid activities that make money through (i) zero-sum games (ii) addiction (iii) a marketing-first approach. If you\u2019ve cleared those filters, then ask (i) is this scalable? (ii) does it make people\u2019s lives better in a significant way?

{"date": "22nd Oct 2014", "title": "Should Giving What We Can change its Pledge? ", "author": "Michelle_Hutchinson", "num_comments": "144 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Giving What We Can is considering broadening the pledge it asks people to make. We\u2019d like to hear your thoughts about that idea!<a></a></p>\n<p>If the Effective Altruism movement increases in size (particularly with the release of books by Peter Singer and Will MacAskill) it will become very important to make sure that enthusiasm for effective altruism translates into impact. It might be easier to do that if there were a standard, concrete action everyone in the movement tended to take. One promising such action is donating 10% of our salaries (and committing to doing so). Currently, many people who identify as effective altruists join Giving What We Can. However, Giving What We Can\u2019s pledge is currently somewhat restrictive in cause areas it covers. Broadening Giving What We Can\u2019s pledge would be one way to bring together effective altruists and thereby increase the chance of enthusiasm for effective altruism translating into concrete actions and long-term commitment<span>. </span></p>\n<p>To work out if this plan is realistic, we need to know how many people actually would join Giving What We Can based on this change to the pledge. So bear in mind as you read this \u2013 if you aren\u2019t yet a member of Giving What We Can, would you join if this change was made? Do you know others who would?</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The proposed pledge is: <em>I recognise that I can use part of my income to do a significant amount of good. Since I can live well enough on a smaller income, I pledge that for the rest of my life or until the day I retire, I shall give at least ten percent of what I earn to whichever organisations can most effectively use it to improve the lives of others, now and in the years to come. I make this pledge freely, openly, and sincerely.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This differs from the current pledge (the full text of which is below) in two ways: it takes out \u2018in the developing world\u2019 from the first sentence, and replaces \u2018to help people in the developing world\u2019 with \u2018to improve the lives of others\u2019 in the second sentence. Importantly, it continues to use the phrase \u2018organisations which can <strong>most</strong> effectively use it...\u2019. This is significant because most people think that the charity they donate to is effective, but to fulfil the pledge, they need to believe the far stronger claim that it is the most effective.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This pledge gets to the heart of what we care about: that we should help people out of extreme poverty because we care about suffering and about making others better off, and because we are in a position to be able to help those in extreme poverty so much at so little cost to ourselves. We understand \u2018improving the lives of others\u2019 to include organisations seeking to improve the welfare of animals.<span> </span>If Giving What We Can adopted the new pledge, it would mean that someone joining who believed that a particular organisation helped others even more than the most effective organisation improving the lives of those in developing countries would be fulfilling the pledge by donating to that organisation.</p>\n<p>Even if this change to the pledge were made, we plan to continue to focus on alleviating extreme poverty. Our mission, vision, values and branding would remain the same. We would continue to evaluate only global poverty charities (broadly construed as now, including for example climate change charities). We think that we can do more good by continuing to focus in this way \u2013 it is our comparative advantage and it provides a concrete and motivating focus. There would be some changes to the website: for example to explain what the new pledge encompassed. We would likely have a page along on what causes other than poverty members might be interested in (for example, this might say a little about animal suffering and point interested people to ACE).</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hopefully you\u2019ve now got a sense of our thoughts. So \u2013 if you aren\u2019t yet a member of Giving What We Can, would a change like this prompt you to join? Do you know others you think would be prompted by it? Do you have any comments or suggestions on the wording of the new pledge? What do you think about the idea of our changing the pledge?

It does not mean that people in rich countries would be likely to be fulfilling the pledge if they give to local charities, since we can typically do far more good for those in extreme poverty (which is why GWWC focuses on the charities it does). It does mean that people who think that the most effective way to prevent suffering is to donate to charities which help animals \u2013 for example which try to eradicate factory farming \u2013 would be fulfilling the pledge by donating to those organisations.</p>\n<p>The change is not likely to make a difference to people who think that the best way to help others is to ensure that the future will go well, since the pledge already explicitly includes people who will live in the future, as well as those alive now. (We already have members who believe, for example, that we should be trying to avert catastrophes in the future, and that that is the best way to help humanity, including those in the developing world.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Giving What We Can\u2019s focus would not change. Our mission and vision would remain the same, the website would continue to be oriented towards poverty, and the events we put on would continue to be about extreme poverty. We would continue to evaluate only global poverty charities (broadly construed, as it currently is, including (for example) climate change charities). This is somewhat similar to the fact that currently some people think that the biggest risk facing those in poverty is from biological terrorism, and those people might join GWWC and fulfil the pledge by donating to organisations that aim to fight bio-terrorism, but we do not evaluate charities of that kind.</p>\n<p>We would have an explanation of the fact that the pledge included charities other than ones directed towards extreme poverty on the FAQs page. We would likely have a page on the website along the lines of \u2018Beyond poverty\u2019. It would say something like: \u2018You might think that the most effective organisations are those working outside of the area of extreme poverty. If you think, for example, that the most effective organisations are those which work to prevent animals from suffering, we encourage you to check out Animal Charity Evaluators...\u2019</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Why_would_we_make_the_change__\"><span>Why would we make the change? </span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </strong>Giving What We Can is about ending extreme poverty, but it is also part of the effective altruism movement, which is about helping others as effectively as possible and making doing so a serious part of one\u2019s life. This idea has had some exposure so far (for example through GiveWell and the wide exposure of Peter Singer\u2019s TED talk). Over the coming year, two books on Effective Altruism are going to be published by William MacAskill and Peter Singer, which have a chance of making effective altruism more mainstream than it has been in the past. This brings with it increased risk of the term getting watered down, such that it does not change people\u2019s behaviour. Therefore, it seems sensible to have a clear action associated with effective altruism which is considered the minimum standard for people to do: donate 10% of their income to the most effective charities. The way we can really persuade others that this is the right thing to do, and encourage them to join us, is for a large number of us to stand together. At the moment the separation between organisations focusing on different cause areas seem to imply that you should make a commitment to helping one to the exclusion of the others. That seems antithetical to effective altruism: it seems better to avoid such fragmentation by having one clear commitment which unites us.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Issues_we_would_need_to_work_out__\"><span>Issues we would need to work out: </span></strong></p>\n<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><!--[endif]-->How the old and the new pledge would interact. One possibility would be for both pledges to exist in parallel, although new members encouraged to take the new pledge.

This is likely to be through the pages mentioned earlier.</p>\n<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><!--[endif]-->The precise wording of the new pledge. In particular, one option we would consider is adding on to the first sentence something along the lines of \u2018...and that there is a large evidence base suggesting that some organisations are orders of magnitude more effective than others.\u2019\u00a0 This might help to ensure that people took a global rather than local focus when deciding which charities to donate to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Alternatives_we_considered_\"><span>Alternatives we considered:</span></strong></p>\n<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><!--[endif]-->There being a cause-neutral pledge which brings together people donating to different effective causes, but hosted by a different organisation. In particular, we discussed this in the context of Effective Altruism Outreach. This seems like it could be a worse option for a couple of reasons:</p>\n<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span>o<span>\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><!--[endif]-->Giving What We Can has an infrastructure built up for people to take a pledge and join a community, including My Giving dashboards, a CRM, member newsletters etc. It would be a huge understanding to replicate this for a second organisation.</p>\n<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span>o<span>\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><!--[endif]-->Giving What We Can is an established community with a large number of members, which has existed for a number of years and endeavoured to build up solidity and credibility. That seems likely to help both in encouraging people to join the community and in ensuring people take the commitment seriously and change their actions accordingly.</p>\n<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span>o<span>\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span><!--[endif]-->Having a number of different pledges is likely to lead to a fractured community. In addition, someone might \u00a0initially feel that the most effective way of helping living creatures is to fight extreme poverty and later change their mind to thinking that the most effective way is to prevent factory farming. It seems like if they still intend to donate at least 10% of their income to the most effective charities, it would be better to support them in that than to say that they have leave GWWC and join a different community instead (unlike, for example, if someone decides they no longer want to rely on evidence to pick effective charities, or no longer wants to donate as much as 10% of their income).</p>\n<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><!--[endif]-->Giving What We Can having multiple pledges \u2013 the current one and a cause neutral one \u2013 and allowing people to take whichever they would prefer. This seems to be a worse option to us because it would be confusing for people, particularly as the two seem so similar. This confusion could be reduced by having the cause neutral pledge be harder to find on the website, so that people only get to it if they are looking for it. But a large part of the point of the pledge is in order for people to stand up and be counted \u2013 to publicly declare that they believe we are in the fortunate position that we can afford to donate at least 10% of our income to help others, and that we should think carefully about where we donate to. Therefore, a pledge that was deliberately difficult to find would seem to diminish a large part of the impact. We have in the past tried having multiple pledges \u2013 we used to have a \u2018Give More Tomorrow\u2019 pledge, because we had had requests from people for being able to commit to donating when they had a pay rise, or got their first job. Although the psychological literature seems to provide additional evidence that future pledges are effective, GMT did not catch on at all. It seemed merely to cause confusion. We would therefore be unwilling to institute two ongoing pledges again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Potential_concerns_we_have__\"><span>Potential concerns we have: </span></strong></p>\n<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><!--[endif]-->Current members being against the change. That might be due to them disagreeing with the current pledge, or due to being unhappy about the idea of the Giving What We Can pledge changing. In order to try to work out to what extent our members will feel this way and whether there are ways to prevent or ameliorate it, we will be talking to them as much as possible throughout the decision process.</p>\n<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><!--[endif]-->New members thinking that their pledge would be fulfilled by donating to a charity in their local area, rather than considering charities on a global scale. We think that the website as a whole, and our recommended charities in particular, will make clear that this isn\u2019t the case. We also try to talk to people both before and after they become members. Therefore, we have multiple opportunities to make sure that people fully understand the pledge.</p>\n<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><!--[endif]-->That the broader idea of \u2018helping others as much as possible\u2019 is not as appealing as specifically helping people in extreme poverty. We are less worried about this than we used to be, because we had assumed that the idea of \u2018effective altruism\u2019 would be entirely unappealing to people, and that has turned out not to be the case (given, for example, Singer\u2019s TED talk). In addition, the extent to which people find the ideas compelling and plausible does not depend just on what the core idea is, but also on what ideas are presented first and context. Right now, all of our members care about helping those in the developing world as effectively as possible, and the fact that some people think that the best way to do that is to ensure that the far future goes well does not seem off-putting to those who think that only current people matter.</p>\n<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->-<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><!--[endif]-->Confusion over the fact that Giving What We Can is focused on preventing extreme poverty, but that its members also donate to other causes. It is difficult to know how much confusion this might cause. So far we have not had a problem with people finding it strange that one could think that the best way to help those in the developing world was to work to avoid e.g. biohazards, even though Giving What We Can does not deal with charities of that kind. It does not seem particularly surprising that Giving What We Can would need to have a focus area for its research, and for the talks it gave, even if some of its members cared about and donated to a broader range of organisations than those in that focus area.</p>\n<p>After much thought about the various considerations at play, the Giving What We Can staff and the trustees are all inclined to think that changing the pledge as above is the best course of action. It wouldn\u2019t involve a change in the focus of what Giving What We Can works on, or its research. But we\u2019re really excited about possibility it provides for bringing together people who all want to help the world as effectively as possible and are willing to donate a significant portion of their income to doing so. We hope that this change would ensure that as the effective altruist movement grows it continues to inspire real change in people\u2019s actions towards helping others as much as we can. \u00a0</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "7th Dec 2014", "title": "Interview with Nir Eyal on Population-Level Bioethics and Non-Utilitarian Effective Altruism", "author": "Ales_Flidr", "num_comments": "3 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><div>\n<p>This interview was done by Melody Guan and Yifan Wu from <a href=\"/harvardea.org\">Harvard College Effective Altruism</a>. It was originally <a href=\"http://harvardea.org/news/2014/11/14/eyal-interview/\">posted</a> on our blog, and I thought it was worth cross-posting on this forum.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Nir Eyal is Associate Professor of Global Health and Social Medicine in the Center for Bioethics at Harvard Medical School and at the Department of Global Health and Population at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He is co-editor of the Oxford University Press series Population-Level Bioethics, and (among other things) chairs the Committee on Philosophy and Medicine of the American Philosophical Association. Eyal\u2019s writings fall primarily in clinical, research, and population-level bioethics. He wrote on ethical questions surrounding HIV research, health worker shortages, healthcare rationing in resource-poor settings, informed consent, personal responsibility for health, fair risk distribution, and accrediting corporations for improving global health. Beyond bioethics, he researches egalitarian theory and consequentialism. Eyal also serves as the faculty advisor of Harvard College Effective Altruism.</em></p>\n<p><strong>HEA:</strong><span> How do we define \u2018effectiveness\u2019? What is the relationship between \u2018effectiveness\u2019 and \u2018fairness\u2019 and how do we balance these two considerations?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Eyal:</strong><span> In my view, fairness matters, and it matters independently of effectiveness understood as maximizing utility. I am a philosophical egalitarian. An egalitarian means someone who cares at least some for equality. For example if we can improve the utility or the health of people who are worse off, say with very bad lifetime health or income, and improve by the same amount the utility or the health of people who are very healthy or wealthy, in my view helping those who are worse off is preferable. One reason is simply that they are worse off. Some effective altruists don\u2019t share my position, but for our purposes this disagreement is not very important, for two reasons. One is that money and other fungible resources have decreasing marginal value, so a poor person typically benefits more from an extra dollar than Bill Gates does. Another reason why there often is agreement between utilitarians who don\u2019t value equality intrinsically and people like me who do is that the most effective things one could do to improve wellbeing happen to address the problems of some of the world\u2019s poorest populations. As Toby Ord emphasizes, a band of interventions such as child vaccinations and mosquito nets have cost effectiveness that far surpasses that of most other interventions currently promoted, by an order of one thousand or more. Even if you give some independent weight to equality, surely you are not going to give it the kind of weight that could override that kind of advantage in cost effectiveness. So in practice we can work very well together.</span></p>\n<p>Another lesson from this. which I don\u2019t think people understand enough, is that you do not need to be a utilitarian in order to be a serious effective altruist. As I said, I\u2019m not a utilitarian. A lot of Harvard philosophers are anti-consequentialist; they think that there are some methods for promoting good consequences that remain wrong. For example, to promote good causes by torturing innocents or by lying to people can remain wrong. But they can all be effective altruists because the \u201cband\u201d of interventions we just talked about are of the sort that any sane person would promote when there no gross violation is demanded. It\u2019s very rare for promoting these causes to require gross violations of individual rights or to be grossly opposed to equality. In short, every reasonable person could be and should be an effective altruist. Even if you give some weight to non-consequentialist considerations, it\u2019s rare to find an ethicist who would just leave on the sidewalk a check for a thousand times more impact, in the name of avoiding a minor transgression or accomplishing any improvement in equality.</p>\n<p><strong>HEA:</strong><span> How do we determine utility in dimensions beyond mortality or quality of living? For example how do we quantify the value of saving a child\u2019s life versus making a blind person see again? Is valuation subjective in the sense that we care more about causes that we are connected to through experience?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Eyal: </strong><span>Health economists and epidemiologists already have techniques to try to assess overall impact. They are already in the business of comparing the prevention of mortality and that of blindness, for example. These techniques sometimes involve surveying a large population regarding which of two health states they would prefer, say a small likelihood of dying and a high likelihood of a certain degree of blindness, and then doing careful epidemiological work to glean a general lesson about the weights that should be assigned to the different states. There are many problems with the prevailing techniques for doing that. Experts are working on improving these techniques, but the bottom line is that we are already [ assigning weights to different health states ], so effective altruists could potentially use existing strategies or hone them.</span></p>\n<p><strong>HEA:</strong><span> Do organizations like GiveWell evaluate effectiveness only based on how effective they are at achieving their goals or also on how important their goals are?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Eyal:</strong><span> The latter. GiveWell try to find how much impact on well being different organizations have. That\u2019s very fortunate because it\u2019s very easy to be effective at achieving one\u2019s goals \u2014 all one needs to do is to find an easy goal to meet even if that goal has no importance whatsoever, or other organizations have already achieved it. GiveWell use findings from research groups such as the Disease Control Priorities second iteration, called DCP2, which gave rough numbers on the cost-effectiveness of various health interventions in developing countries. For instance, what\u2019s more effective for combatting Cholera: giving vaccinations or teaching nurses to wash their hands? Colleagues at Harvard are promoting Cholera vaccination, but DCP2 quotes the effectiveness of teaching nurses to wash their hands at 1000 times greater.</span></p>\n<p><strong>HEA: </strong><span>How should investing in novel, research-based solutions be balanced against tackling current, low-hanging-fruit issues using known solutions? It seems that a lot of global development work does not emphasize scientific innovation.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Eyal:</strong><span> Delivering now something that\u2019s known to work versus delivering later what is currently only experimental, if and when it gets proven, involves two differences. One is in the level of \u201cgambling\u201d and the other one is between close in time and farther along in time. I think there is no intrinsic value in being risk averse and in showing value in the nearer future [ as opposed to in the later future ]. But the answer will differ according to the details and the numbers in concrete cases.</span></p>\n<p><strong>HEA:</strong><span> When making explicit models for quantifying the value of causes, should we always embed complications like risk aversion and time value of money calculations (as captured in most economic models)?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Eyal:</strong><span> You are right in that these are issues of ethical complexity here. A related, third topic of ethical complexity: how to count deaths at different stages of life? Should we count the death of a one day old baby expected otherwise to live many years as a far worse tragedy than the death of a college student expected to live a few less years forthwith? This requires careful consideration.</span></p>\n<p><strong>HEA: </strong><span>Will we ever agree on one answer for these questions? Or perhaps we\u2019ll have to live with uncertainty?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Eyal:</strong><span> One possible policy is to prioritize the areas where genuine uncertainty shows up less, so that we are relatively immune from uncertainty. By \u201cuncertainty,\u201d I don\u2019t mean a matter of actual public debate. Many public debates are due to simple misunderstanding, or money infusion into the political debate. I mean genuine, deep doubt among highly informed people. One reason why I\u2019m excited about working in global health is that there is very little doubt about the urgency of the basic causes being served\u2014promoting the health of relatively unhealthy and poor people. Little if any uncertainty about the value of that.</span></p>\n<p><strong>HEA:</strong><span> What are some difficult open questions related to global health?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Eyal:</strong><span> One hard question is how to allocate organs for transplantation. You could prioritize the patients who are likely to benefit the most from the organs, that is, those whose prospects would improve the most from receiving them. You could alternatively prioritize those patients who have been registered on the waitlist or on dialysis the longest time, which is how in the US kidneys are currently being allocated. You could also prioritize patients by how ill they would be without receiving the organ, that is, give the organs to severely ill patients. Ethicists try to find good arguments for and against different distributive principles.</span></p>\n<p><strong>HEA:</strong><span> How do cultural considerations factor in?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Eyal:</strong><span> Culture enters the picture, because it affects what intervention would work and which would fail. Furthermore, if for cultural reasons people feel utterly violated by an intervention that would improve their health, that\u2019s not a happy scenario. Effective altruists should take that into account even if, like myself, they are not cultural relativists.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div></div></div></div>"},

href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2014/10/people-and-charitable-causes-are-importantly-different-things/\">cross-posted from the Practical Ethics blog</a> at his request.</em></p>\n<p>Like Prot \u2013 the lovable character played by Kevin Spacey in the underrated movie <em>K-PAX</em> \u2013 you\u2019re an intelligent benevolent extraterrestrial who has just been beamed to Earth.\u00a0 Sadly, unlike Prot, you have no return ticket.\u00a0 The good news for you is that just moments after hopping off of your beam of light, you found a briefcase stuffed with $3 million.\u00a0 Being benevolent, and having concern for the inhabitants of Earth, you decide to give nearly all of this money to charity.\u00a0 Being completely new to the planet, however, you do not yet have any <em>special </em>concern for anyone here \u2013 no friends, no loved ones.\u00a0 Having this equal concern for everyone, you want simply to do the most good possible, and so you decide to give this money to <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">the most cost-effective charities you can find</a>.</p>\n<p>Exit science fiction scenario.</p>\n<p>One important difference between each of us and this Prot-agonist is that we do have friends and loved ones; we have rich shared histories with them, we care deeply about them, and, crucially, the level of concern we have for them is <em>not</em> on a par with the general concern we have for strangers.\u00a0 If your fianc\u00e9 were drowning in a lake to your north, and ten strangers were drowning in a lake to your south, and you could either rescue the one to your north or instead the ten to your south (but not all eleven!), you\u2019d probably head north.\u00a0 Whether this constitutes morally good behavior on your part <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/special-obligations/\">is a matter of controversy among contemporary ethical theorists</a>.\u00a0 But let\u2019s assume the commonsense view that it\u2019s not wrong of you to save your fianc\u00e9 over the ten others.\u00a0 This degree of special partial concern is, we\u2019ll suppose, justified.</p>\n<p>Tragedy strikes: \u00a0after several long months of battling, your fianc\u00e9 dies of cancer.\u00a0 You are absolutely devastated.\u00a0 But, quite admirably, you remain the kindhearted person you always were, and \u2013 inspired by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Bucket_Challenge\">some recent social media spotlights on philanthropy and fundraising</a>\u00a0\u2013 you decide to give a substantial portion of your income to charity.\u00a0 You could focus your donations on a wide variety of causes:\u00a0 heart disease, AIDS, cancer, tuberculosis, malaria, schistosomiasis, and so on.\u00a0 Having recently lost someone to cancer, and owing to our tendency to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nonprofitmarketingblog.com/comments/why_people_take_action/\">take action and give for deeply personal reasons</a>,\u201d\u00a0you browse the internet for the best cancer charities you can find, and eventually settle on one.\u00a0 Before pressing \u201center\u201d on its payment page, you have another thought:\u00a0 <em>Hold on, what exactly </em>is<em> the connection between my fianc\u00e9 and this particular cause?</em></p>\n<p>It occurs to you that your fianc\u00e9 is not among the beneficiaries of the charity (and not only because they\u2019re no longer living).\u00a0 Indeed, those you\u2019d be helping, whether your money went towards fighting AIDS, cancer, or malaria, would <em>all</em> be complete strangers to you.\u00a0 We granted that the special concern you had for your fianc\u00e9 would justify you in placing significantly more importance on <em>their </em>life and well-being than that of strangers, but would this same special concern for your (now deceased) fianc\u00e9 justify you in placing significantly more importance on the lives and well-being of <em>strangers afflicted with cancer</em> than that of strangers afflicted with heart disease, AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, or schistosomiasis?\u00a0 Suppose you could prevent one stranger from dying of cancer, or instead prevent ten \u2013 or one hundred \u2013 from dying of malaria.\u00a0 Shouldn\u2019t you help the greater number in this case?\u00a0 The bond between you and the stranger dying of cancer doesn\u2019t seem sufficiently strong to outweigh something as morally heavy as ninety-nine lives.\u00a0 And this is no outlandish scenario:\u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/research/charities-area/malaria\">charities combating malaria are likely to be hundreds of times more cost-effective than most other charities</a>. \u00a0(Though focusing on <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2014-05-13/toby-ord-and-dcp3\">particular cancer treatments in the developing world can also be highly cost-effective</a>.)</p>\n<p>You continue to ruminate:\u00a0 <em>fighting cancer is a meaningful way of </em>honoring<em> my late fianc\u00e9, and this is what justifies me in especially favoring cancer charities.</em>\u00a0 I am not sure this will cut the moral mustard.\u00a0 This latest thought questionably presupposes that the relevant group to which your fianc\u00e9 belongs is \u201cpeople with cancer\u201d rather than \u201cpeople who have suffered from a crippling illness\u201d or simply \u201cpeople who have suffered.\u201d\u00a0 Without some such questionable presupposition, it would be at least as plausible to claim that <em>reducing unnecessary death and suffering</em> appropriately honors, and sincerely expresses your love for, your late fianc\u00e9 (and you should then in turn be open to the possibility that you could do much more toward realizing this italicized aim by giving to a malaria charity than a cancer one).\u00a0 On reflection, it often seems bizarre to invest much special emotional, personal, or moral significance in the very particular way in which someone is harmed.\u00a0 Holding constant the amount of harm done, does it really matter whether the cause is cancer, malaria, or oncoming traffic?</p>\n<p>If you do give to <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com/\">a malaria charity</a>\u00a0as a symbolic expression of concern for your loved one, simply as someone who has suffered, it may not be immediately obvious to those around you that this is part of your reason for giving \u2013 whereas it might be if you gave to a cancer charity (given that someone close to you was a victim of cancer).\u00a0 But this shouldn\u2019t dictate where you donate, and anyway you can always explain yourself!</p>\n<p>Special concern for your fianc\u00e9 may justify your prioritizing <em>them</em> over others, but it does not entail a special reason or justification for you to focus your donations on cancer <em>charities</em>.\u00a0 At least, if there is a connection between these two types of special partiality, it is not obvious what it is.\u00a0 <a href=\"http://qz.com/250845/this-week-lets-dump-a-few-ice-buckets-to-wipe-out-malaria-too/\">Other authors</a> have also cautioned against projecting moral properties of persons onto causes:\u00a0 the plausible claim that all people are equally morally important is not be confused with the very <em>im</em>plausible claim that all <em>causes</em> are equally morally important.\u00a0 Moreover, it is not the case that being fair to all people translates into giving equally to all charities, or determining where to give on the basis of a coin toss (or several).\u00a0 The general lesson:\u00a0 people and charitable causes are importantly different things.\u00a0 If we can remember this at the right times, we\u2019ll be better able to give using our heads, in addition to our hearts.</p></div></div>"},

They're rejoined by AMF, as the room for more funding issues that led to it being delisted have been resolved to GiveWell's satisfaction. Together these organisations form GiveWell's list of 'top charities', which is now joined by a list of other charities which they see as excellent but not quite in the top tier. The charities on this list are Development Media International, Living Goods, and two salt fortification programs (run by GAIN and ICCIDD).</p>\n<p>As normal, GiveWell's site contains extremely detailed writeups on these organisations. Here are some shorter descriptions which I wrote for <a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/proven-charities.html\">Charity Science's donations page</a> and my <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/actions/donating\">tool for donating tax-efficiently</a>, starting with the new entries:</p>\n<h2 id=\"GiveWell_s_newly_added_charities\">GiveWell's newly-added charities</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Boost_health_and_cognitive_development_with_salt_fortification\">Boost health and cognitive development with salt fortification</h3>\n<p>The charities <a href=\"http://www.gainhealth.org/\">GAIN</a> and <a href=\"http://www.iccidd.org/\">ICCIDD</a> run programs that fortify the salt that millions of poor people eat with iodine. There is <a href=\"http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/idd/en/\">strong evidence</a> that this boosts their health and cognitive development; iodine deficiency causes pervasive mental impairment, as well as stillbirth and congenital abnormalities such as severe retardation. It can be done very cheaply on a mass scale, so is highly cost-effective. GAIN is registered in the US and ICCIDD in Canada <span>(although Canadians can give to either via Charity Science, which for complex reasons helps others who donate tax-deductibly to other charities)</span>, allowing for especially efficient donations from these countries, and taxpayers from other countries can also often give to them tax-deductibly. For more information, read GiveWell's detailed reviews of <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/charities/GAIN\">GAIN</a> and <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/charities/iccidd\">ICCIDD</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Educate_millions_in_life_saving_practices_with_Development_Media_International\">Educate millions in life-saving practices with Development Media International</h3>\n<p>Development Media International (DMI) produces radio and television broadcasts in developing countries that tell people about improved health practices that can save lives, especially those of young children. Examples of such practices include exclusive breastfeeding. DMI are conducting a randomized controlled trial of their program which has found promising indications of a large decrease in children's deaths. With more funds they would be able to reach millions of people, due to the unparalleled reach of broadcasting. For more information, read <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/charities/DMI\">GiveWell's detailed review</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Bring_badly_needed_goods_and_health_services_to_the_poor_with_Living_Goods\">Bring badly-needed goods and health services to the poor with Living Goods</h3>\n<p>Living Goods is a non-profit which runs a network of people selling badly-needed health and household goods door-to-door in their communities in Uganda and Kenya and provide free health advice. A randomized controlled trial suggested that this caused a 25% reduction in under-5 mortality among other benefits. Products sold range from fortified foods and mosquito nets to cookstoves and contraceptives. Giving to Living Goods is an exciting opportunity to bring these badly needed goods and services to some of the poorest families in the world.

For more information, read <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming\">GiveWell's detailed review</a>, or the <a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/deworming-charities.html\">more accessible Charity Science summary</a>. Deworm the World is registered in the USA and SCI in the UK, allowing for tax-efficient direct donations in those countries, and taxpayers from other countries can also often give to them efficiently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Make_unconditional_cash_transfers_with_GiveDirectly\">Make unconditional cash transfers with GiveDirectly</h3>\n<p>GiveDirectly lets you empower people to purchase whatever they believe will help them most. <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers\">Eleven randomized controlled trials</a> have supported cash transfers\u2019 impact, and there is strong evidence that recipients know their own situation best and generally invest in things which make them <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/Interventions/Cash%20Transfers/Haushofer%20and%20Shapiro%202013.pdf\">happier in the long term</a>.

Thankfully a $6 bednet can stop mosquitos from infecting children while they sleep, preventing this deadly disease. This intervention has exceptionally robust evidence behind it, with many randomized controlled trials suggesting that it is one of the most cost-effective ways to save lives. The Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) is an exceptional charity in every respect, and was GiveWell's top recommendation in 2012 and 2013. Not all bednet charities are created equal, and AMF outperforms the rest on every count. They can distribute nets cheaper than most others, for just $6.13 US. They distribute long-lasting nets which don\u2019t need retreating with insecticide. They are extremely transparent and monitor their own impact carefully, requiring photo verification from each net distribution.

As well as simply being inspiring and nice stories to share, they\u2019re interesting examples of how anyone can raise a lot of money and spread awareness of effective charity, and of the reactions that friends and family have to this.</span></p>\n<p>The fundraisers in question were run by\u00a0Theron Pummer and Peter Hurford.\u00a0Theron is a philosophy post-doc associated with FHI\u2019s <span><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.populationethics.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHqCI0X4Za9cDWss2w226IMu77nZA\">Population Ethics Project</a></span>\u00a0who previously ran the <span><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Feffectivealtruismhub.com%2Fgroups%2Fsan-diego-effective-altruists&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH8TvuUpqeYbyEh59S4ZtLWItOSqg\">San Diego EA group</a></span>; Peter is a Chicago-based data scientist who co-founded <span><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdotimpact.im%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFqMQNgxKEzZPj3IxBE9sOL19HYcg\">.impact</a></span>. <span><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbirthday.causevox.com%2Ftheron-pummer&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGEfgiYfoNwsOQn8xVKJZEuusPkJw\">Theron\u2019s</a></span>\u00a0fundraiser raised $14,028 and <span><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbirthday.causevox.com%2Fpeter-hurford&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGJYysTGy3egByI37lxSXnOBeOGSg\">Peter\u2019s</a></span>\u00a0raised $5,010.32\u00a0including matching funds - a pretty good haul! They both vastly exceeded their original goals - Theron originally aimed for $1,000 before doubling this to $2,000, and then overshooting by a cool twelve grand, while Peter raised his goal from $1,000 to $2,000 to $3,000 to $4,000 to $4,500. It was fun to watch - charity meets the Grand National.</p>\n<p>How did they do it? It wasn\u2019t magic. They simply emailed a particularly large cross-section of their personal networks - Peter, for instance, emailed 145 people. Naturally, the majority of these people weren\u2019t in the habit of giving them birthday presents, but this didn\u2019t matter in the way it would have had Theron and Peter been asking for accessories for their private yachts (which I gather are already well furnished). We\u2019ve consistently found that friends and family react very positively when asked if they want to contribute to fundraisers. Many of Theron\u2019s donations came from philosophers who he only knew passingly from conferences and the like, and hadn\u2019t spoken to in a long time.</p>\n<p>One useful lesson from this is that many people don\u2019t need much prompting to give to effective charities. Plausibly they were ready to give to charity anyway, and a friend (even a loose one) making an ask prompted them to do so and determined their charity choice. It\u2019s worth noting that Theron and Peter judged that the vast majority of their donations wouldn\u2019t have been made otherwise, basing this partly on what those responsible for those donations said.\u00a0An uncertain question is how much difference was made by the choice of charity (deworming for Theron and AMF for Peter). As I\u2019ve said, the fact that a friend was making the ask and had chosen this particular charity was plausibly dominant, but these were clearly causes that people were happy to give $20 or $200 to, and it\u2019s hard not to think that the figures Theron and Peter were able to cite made a difference.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to see if you can emulate Theron and Peter\u2019s success - and help a great many people in the process - then you can sign up to run a <span><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbirthday.causevox.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCLB57z1I-MD8GiJoJBXoTEGCZ0w\">birthday</a></span>\u00a0or <span><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fchristmas.causevox.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG71jPzXp-6jQIlevG03MXamvhBSg\">Christmas</a></span>\u00a0fundraiser.

{"date": "13th May 2014", "title": "Consider raising IQ to do good", "author": "Lila_Rieber", "num_comments": "4 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p></p><h2 id=\"Summary\">Summary</h2>\nInterventions to raise IQ could do a lot of good because of potentially significant <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">flow-through effects</a> of intelligence. IQ also has the benefit of being easily quantifiable, which would make it simpler to compare interventions.\n<h2 id=\"Cost_effectiveness_metrics\">Cost-effectiveness metrics</h2>\nAn important metric for comparing causes is cost-effectiveness (number of \u201cthings\u201d accomplished per dollar). Which things should we count? Some cost-effectiveness measures are very specific, such as the number of malaria cases prevented per dollar. But when comparing between causes (such as between preventing malaria and improving education), it\u2019s best to have a broad metric. There are two major types of metrics: health-related (e.g., <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year\">quality-adjusted life years</a>) and economic (e.g., increases in GDP).\nWhile health-related and economic metrics are appropriate in some cases, they aren\u2019t ideal. Health-related metrics may be relatively unimportant if you care about far-future causes, such as <a href=\"/ea/50/preventing_human_extinction/\">existential risk</a>. Economic outcomes can be hard to measure. Even GDP, one of the most common metrics of economic output, is not universally accepted as a valid measure of economic productivity.<p></p><p>Instead, I propose that effective altruists take a closer look at interventions to raise IQ. Cognitive improvements would have a wide range of benefits, described below, and would be easy to quantify. As Nick Beckstead <a href=\"/ea/3u/a_proposed_adjustment_to_the_astronomical_waste/\">argues</a>, effective altruists who want to improve the far future should consider taking actions that have broad, generalized benefits.\n</p><h3 id=\"Is_the_low_end_or_the_high_end_important_\">Is the low end or the high end important?</h3>\nThe most obvious way to measure cost-effectiveness of IQ interventions would be to measure the cost of increasing the average IQ in a population of a certain size by one point. However, the average hides a lot of information.\nAssume a population has an IQ distribution like this:<p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IQ-initial.png\"><img src=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IQ-initial.png\" alt=\"IQ initial\"></a></p><p>One intervention results in this:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IQ-final-1.png\"><img src=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IQ-final-1.png\" alt=\"IQ final 1\"></a></p><p>Another results in this:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IQ-final-2.png\"><img src=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IQ-final-2.png\" alt=\"IQ final 2\"></a></p><p>Same increase in the average, very different impacts.</p><p>It\u2019s an open question whether it\u2019s more important to improve IQ at the low end or the high end. (The two often aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.) My intuitions:\n</p><ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>To reduce violence, it would be most important to improve IQ at the low end.</li>\n\t<li>Better decision-making would occur more dramatically at the low end, but people at the high end are more likely to be making important decisions.</li>\n\t<li>Improving the low end would be important for increasing economic productivity, but most long-term growth would come from the high end (due to increased technological progress).</li>\n\t<li>Most of the benefits from innovation would come from the high end.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 id=\"Benefits_of_increasing_IQ\">Benefits of increasing IQ</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Decreased_violence\">Decreased violence</h3>\nThe strong correlation between low IQ and violent or criminal behavior is clear from extensive research. <a href=\"#ftn1\">[1] </a><a href=\"#ftn2\">[2] </a><a href=\"#ftn3\">[3]</a> The fact that the correlation is observed even among children raised by the same parents suggest that IQ causes violent behavior, rather than some environmental factor causing both low IQ and violence. <a href=\"#ftn4\">[4]</a><p></p><p>Steven Pinker argues that the Flynn effect (the consistent increase in IQ that has been observed over generations for about a century) is responsible for the remarkable decrease in violence that has occurred from prehistoric times to the present day. According to him, reason and rationality are some of the \u201cbetter angels of our nature\u201d that can curb violence.<a href=\"#ftn5\">[5]</a> It is plausible that increased IQ will lead to better reasoning, though uncertain. (See below.)</p><p>There is good evidence that the sharp drop in crime during the latter half of the twentieth century was due to decreased exposure to lead. (See <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline\">here</a>.) One of the most notable effects of lead exposure is decreased IQ, but it\u2019s unclear whether the increase in crime associated with lead exposure is due to its cognitive effects.\n</p><h3 id=\"Increased_economic_productivity\">Increased economic productivity</h3>\nA 1-point increase in IQ corresponds to approximately a 1% increase in wages for an individual.<a href=\"#ftn6\">[6] </a> There is also a strong correlation (0.82) between IQ and per capita GDP, though it seems plausible that causality runs in both directions, with extreme poverty causing low IQ. <a href=\"#ftn7\">[7] </a>\n<h3 id=\"Improved_decision_making\">Improved decision-making</h3>\nA study of college students showed that students with higher IQ did not do significantly better on some tests of rationality, though they did do better on other tests and were better able to evaluate the quality of an argument.<a href=\"#ftn8\">[8]</a> People with high IQ are also more likely to underestimate their own biases that hinder their rationality.<a href=\"#ftn9\">[9]</a><p></p><p>However, the average college student probably has an IQ far above the global average, so the low end was not represented in this study. It also did not capture the high end, since it only included students from an average college. Additionally, it only measured abstract tests of irrationality (such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy\">base rate fallacy</a>). There are plenty of more prosaic examples of rationality in everyday life. (Since rationality has connotations of abstract reasoning, I prefer to call this \u201cdecision-making\u201d.) It\u2019s unclear that the formal study of fallacies and biases significantly affects decision-making. (See <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/9p/extreme_rationality_its_not_that_great/\">here </a> and <a href=\"http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/optimalbias\">here</a>.) On more mundane matters, someone with a low IQ would be expected to make worse decisions than someone with an average IQ. People with low IQs are more likely to experience a range of poor outcomes, such as teen pregnancy, controlling for childhood socioeconomic status.<a href=\"#ftn10\">[10]</a></p><p>I did not find any research on whether IQ affects rationality at the high end, but it seems like a promising topic, since high-IQ people are more likely to be making important decisions in society.</p><p>In a survey that controlled for factors such as education and income, IQ was correlated with opposition to economic protectionism. Economists almost universally agree that protectionism is bad policy.<a href=\"#ftn11\">[11]</a> Even Paul Krugman, who generally favors greater government intervention in the economy, opposes protectionism. (He once said that if there were an Economist\u2019s Creed, it would include the statement \u201cI advocate free trade.\u201d) Free trade is a particularly worthy cause for effective altruists, who care about the interests of people in the developing world. It is estimated that the removal of all subsidies and trade barriers would have a net economic benefit of $44 trillion, much of which would benefit the poor. Since there\u2019s currently widespread public support for protectionism, it seems plausible that increased opposition could lead to the removal of trade barriers.<a href=\"#ftn12\">[12]</a>\n</p><h3 id=\"Innovation\">Innovation</h3>\nIncreasing IQ could have large benefits in scientific and technological progress. People with extremely high intelligence are far more likely than average people to receive tenure at a research university and be successful in business. Even within scientific research, the most influential research tends to be produced by people who have higher intelligence than the average scientist.<a href=\"#ftn13\">[13]</a>\n<h2 id=\"Interventions_to_increase_IQ\">Interventions to increase IQ</h2>\nSocial interventions targeting young children may be able to increase intelligence. The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) is an inventory that measures the quality of a child\u2019s home environment, with items such as \u201cchild has three or more puzzles\u201d and \u201cparent holds child close for 10-15 minutes per day\u201d. Controlling for maternal IQ, the HOME score was positively correlated with IQ for two-year-olds.<a href=\"#ftn14\">[14]</a> However, interventions to change behavior are often <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/66-social-interventions-gone-wrong\">difficult to implement</a>, though there are some that have been successful.<p></p><p>Nutrient supplements (particularly iodine, but also protein and iron) are a cost-effective way to increase IQ. Studies generally only report changes in the median or the mean IQ, but presumably supplements would mainly help the low end of the spectrum.</p><p>Another option is to use <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/embryo.pdf\">in vitro fertilization to increase IQ</a>, but this could be politically controversial.\n</p><h2 id=\"Implications_for_effective_altruists\">Implications for effective altruists</h2>\nEffective altruists may give more consideration to causes such as iodine supplementation because of their large flow-through effects compared to other public health programs, such as deworming. While this would be a step in the right direction, I generally think it\u2019s relatively ineffective to fund proven, non-controversial public health interventions, because the market for funding these causes is <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/\">fairly saturated</a>.\nInstead, I propose that effective altruists support efforts to do research into IQ. This could mean doing the research directly or doing funding or advocacy. In general, effective altruists should support research if they have reason to believe it\u2019s <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/103-how-to-do-important-research\">systematically underfunded</a>.\n<h3 id=\"Which_types_of_research_are_underfunded_\">Which types of research are underfunded?</h3>\n\u00a0\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Social interventions?\nWhile psychologists are aware of some social factors that influence cognitive abilities, it seems that the main bottleneck is the difficulty in changing behavior through social interventions. Given the large number of people working on social interventions of all types, I don\u2019t believe this would be systematically underfunded. (On the other hand, my impression is that social psychology and public policy are seen as lower-status than, say, theoretical physics, so they may attract fewer talented people. This would imply that there are opportunities for a bright person to have an impact.)</li>\n\t<li>Biomedical interventions?\nThere is a lot of research into interventions such as iodine supplementation that raise IQ. However, I believe that these may be underfunded because they are viewed as public health interventions and the long-term benefits are not appreciated. I think working to identify new biomedical influences on IQ would be very cost-effective.</li>\n\t<li>Genetic interventions?\nThis type of research is probably the most underfunded, due to social stigma. However, the main bottleneck may be changing public attitudes regarding these efforts, which brings us back to the realm of social psychology and advocacy.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2 id=\"Potential_objections\">Potential objections</h2>\n\u00a0\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Childhood IQ tests are inaccurate, so it can take decades to evaluate a new intervention.</em>\nResponse: Though childhood IQ tests are less accurate than adult tests, they correlate fairly well with adult scores.<a href=\"#ftn15\">[15]</a> The question is not whether IQ is easy to measure, but whether it\u2019s easier than other metrics of success, such as \u201cspreading positive values\u201d. Additionally, this implies that it may be worth investing in better tests of IQ.</li>\n\t<li><em>Other interventions, such as deworming, have similar flow-through effects.</em>\nResponse: There is some evidence (summarized <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming#Developmentalimpacts\">here</a>) that deworming increases school attendance, wages, and labor productivity (though not through increasing IQ). However, the evidence is mixed and there\u2019s a much narrower range of benefits than raising IQ could have. Additionally, school attendance seems like a bad metric of success, given the extremely poor quality of schools in the developing world.</li>\n\t<li><em>We might create evil geniuses.</em>\nResponse: This seems worth exploring further. However, the preliminary evidence suggests that raising IQ will reduce violence.\nI don\u2019t currently advocate the creation of superhuman intelligence, simply increasing intelligence within the \u201cnormal\u201d range. If one thinks that increasing the number of people in the (normal) high-IQ range would be net negative, would it be good to reduce the number of people in this range? If one says it wouldn\u2019t be good, there\u2019s an appearance of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias\">status quo bias</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n\u00a0<p></p><p><em>Thanks to Jonah Sinick for research.</em>\n</p><h2 id=\"References\">References</h2>\n<a href=\"#ftnref1\">[1]</a> Brie Diamond, Robert G.

Therefore we shouldn\u2019t do P\u2019.</p>\n<p>This could make sense if X wasn\u2019t especially integral to the goal. For instance if the proposal were to measure short distances by triangulation with nearby objects, a reasonable criticism would be that the angles are hard to measure, relative to measuring the distance directly. But this argument is commonly used in situations where optimizing X is the whole point of the activity, or a large part of it.</p>\n<p>Criticism of utilitarianism provides a good example. A common argument is that it\u2019s just not possible to tell if you are increasing net utility, or by how much. The critic concludes then that a different moral strategy is better, for instance some sort of intuitive deontology. But if the utilitarian is correct that value is about providing creatures with utility, then the extreme difficulty of doing the associated mathematics perfectly should not warrant abandoning the goal. One should always be better off putting the reduced effort one is willing to contribute into what utilitarian accuracy it buys, rather than throwing it away on a strategy that is more random with regard to the goal.</p>\n<p>A CEO would sound ridiculous making this argument to his shareholders. \u2018You guys are being ridiculous. It\u2019s just not possible to know which actions will increase the value of the company exactly how much. Why don\u2019t we try to make sure that all of our meetings end on time instead?\u2019</p>\n<p>In general, when optimizing X somehow is integral to the goal, the argument must fail. If the point is to make X as close to three as possible for instance, no matter how bad your best estimate is of what X will be under different conditions, you can\u2019t do better by ignoring X all together. If you had a non-estimating-X strategy which you anticipated would do better than your best estimate in getting a good value of X, then you in fact believe yourself to have a better estimating-X strategy.</p>\n<p>I have criticized this kind of argument before in the specific realm of valuing of human life, but it seems to apply more widely.\u00a0 Another recent example: people\u2019s attention spans vary between different activities, therefore there is no such thing as an attention span and we shouldn\u2019t try to make it longer. Arguably similar to some lines of \u2018people are good at different things, therefore there is no such thing as intelligence and we shouldn\u2019t try to measure it or thereby improve it\u2019.</p>\n<p>Probabilistic risk assessment is claimed by some to be impossibly difficult. People are often wrong, and may fail to think of certain contingencies in advance. So if we want to know how prepared to be for a nuclear war for instance, we should do something qualitative with scenarios and the like. This could be a defensible position. Perhaps intuitions can better implicitly assess probabilities via some other activity than explicitly thinking about them. However I have not heard this claim accompanied by any such motivating evidence. Also if this were true, it would likely make sense to convert the qualitative assessments into quantitative ones and aggregate them with information from other sources rather than disregarding quantitative assessments all together.</p>\n<p>Part of\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/\">Introduction to Effective Altruism</a></p>\n<p>Previous:\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/5e/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/\">Efficient Charity, Do Unto Others</a>\u00a0\u2022 Next: <a href=\"/ea/73/givewells_top_charities_for_giving_season_2013/\">GiveWell's Top Charities for Giving Season 2013</a></p></div></div>"},

Or do you want to come with me and change the world?\u201d.\u00a0 This sounds convincing until one thinks closely about it.</span></p>\n<p><span>Steve Jobs was a famous salesman. \u00a0 He was known for his selling ability, not his honesty.\u00a0 His terminology here was interesting.\u00a0 \u2018Change the world\u2019 is a phrase that both sounds important and is difficult to argue with.\u00a0 Arguing if Apple was really \u2018changing the world\u2019 would have been pointless, because the phrase was so ambiguous that there would be little to discuss.\u00a0 On paper, of course Apple is changing the world, but then of course any organization or any individual is also \u2018changing\u2019 the world.\u00a0 A real discussion of if Apple \u2018changes the world\u2019 would lead to a discussion of what \u2018changing the world\u2019 actually means, which would lead to obscure philosophy, steering the conversation away from the actual point. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>\u2018Changing the world\u2019 is an effective marketing tool that\u2019s useful for building the feeling of consensus. Steve Jobs used it heavily, as had endless numbers of businesses, conferences, nonprofits, and TV shows.\u00a0 It\u2019s used because it sounds good and is typically not questioned, so I\u2019m here to question it.\u00a0 I believe that the popularization of this phrase creates confused goals and perverse incentives from people who believe they are doing good things.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><strong>Problem 1: 'Changing the World' Leads to Television Value over Real Value</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>It leads nonprofit workers to passionately chase feeble things.\u00a0 I\u2019m amazed by the variety that I see in people who try to \u2018change the world\u2019. Some grow organic food, some research rocks, some play instruments. They do basically everything. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Few people protest this variety.\u00a0 There are millions of voices giving the appeal to \u2018change the world\u2019 in the way that would validate many radically diverse pursuits. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>TED, the modern symbol of the intellectual elite for many, is itself a grab bag of a ways to \u2018change the world\u2019, without any sense of scale between pursuits.\u00a0 People tell comedic stories, sing songs, discuss tales of personal adventures and so on.\u00a0 In TED Talks, all presentations are shown side-by-side with the same lighting and display.\u00a0 Yet in real life some projects produce orders of magnitude more output than others.</span></p>\n<p><span>At 80,000 Hours, I read many applications for career consulting. I got the sense that there are many people out there trying to live their lives in order to eventually produce a TED talk.\u00a0 To them, that is what \u2018changing the world\u2019 means.\u00a0 These are often very smart and motivated people with very high opportunity costs. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p>I would see an application that would express interest in either starting an orphanage in Uganda, creating a woman's movement in Ohio, or making a conservatory in Costa Rica.\u00a0 It was clear that they were trying to \u2018change the world\u2019 in a very vague and TED-oriented way.</p>\n<p><span>I believe that \u2018Changing the World\u2019 is promoted by TED, but internally acts mostly as a Schelling point.\u00a0 Agreeing on the importance of \u2018changing the world\u2019 is a good way of coming to a consensus without having to decide on moral philosophy. \u2018Changing the world\u2019 is simply the minimum common denominator for what that community can agree upon.\u00a0 This is a useful social tool, but an unfortunate side effect was that it inspired many others to follow this shelling point itself.\u00a0 Please don\u2019t make the purpose of your life the lowest common denominator of a specific group of existing intellectuals.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>It leads businesses to be gain employees and media attention without having to commit to anything.\u00a0 I\u2019m living in Silicon Valley, and \u2018Change the World\u2019 is an incredibly common phrase for new and old startups. Silicon Valley (the TV show) made fun of it, as do much of the media.\u00a0 They should, but I think much of the time they miss the point; the problem here is not one where the companies are dishonest, but one where their honestly itself just doesn\u2019t mean much.\u00a0 Declaring that a company is \u2018changing the world\u2019 isn\u2019t really declaring anything. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Hiring conversations that begin and end with the motivation of \u2018changing the world\u2019 are like hiring conversations that begin and end with making \u2018lots\u2019 of money.\u00a0 If one couldn\u2019t compare salaries between different companies, they would likely select poorly for salary.\u00a0 In terms of social benefit, most companies don\u2019t attempt to quantify their costs and benefits on society except in very specific and positive ways for them.\u00a0 \u201cGoogle has enabled Haiti disaster recovery\u201d for social proof sounds to me like saying \u201cWe paid this other person $12,000 in July 2010\u201d for salary proof. It sounds nice, but facts selected by a salesperson are simply not complete.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><strong>Problem 2: \u2018Changing the World\u2019 Creates Black and White Thinking</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>The idea that one wants to \u2018change the world\u2019 implies that there is such a thing as \u2018changing the world\u2019 and such a thing is \u2018not changing the world\u2019.\u00a0 It implies that there are \u2018world changers\u2019 and people who are not \u2018world changers\u2019. It implies that there is one group of \u2018important people\u2019 out there and then a lot of \u2018useless\u2019 others.</span></p>\n<p><span>This directly supports the \u2018Great Man\u2019 theory, a 19th century idea that history and future actions are led by a small number of \u2018great men\u2019.\u00a0 There\u2019s not a lot of academic research supporting this theory, but there\u2019s a lot of attention to it, and it\u2019s a lot of fun to pretend is true. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p>But it\u2019s not.\u00a0 There is typically a lot of unglamorous work behind every successful project or organization. Behind every Steve Jobs are thousands of very intelligent and hard-working employees and millions of smart people who have created a larger ecosystem. If one only pays attention to Steve Jobs they will leave out most of the work. They will praise Steve Jobs far too highly and disregard the importance of unglamorous labor.</p>\n<p><span>Typically much of the best work is also the most unglamorous.\u00a0 Making WordPress websites, sorting facts into analysis, cold calling donors. Many the best ideas for organizations may be very simple and may have been done before. However, for someone looking to get to TED conferences or become superstars, it is very easy to look over other comparatively menial labor. This means that not only will it not get done, but those people who do it feel worse about themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span>So some people do important work and feel bad because it doesn\u2019t meet the TED standard of \u2018change the world\u2019.\u00a0 Others try ridiculously ambitious things outside their own capabilities, fail, and then give up.\u00a0 Others don\u2019t even try, because their perceived threshold is too high for them.\u00a0 The very idea of a threshold and a \u2018change or don\u2019t change the world\u2019 approach is simply false, and believing something that\u2019s both false and fundamentally important is really bad.</span></p>\n<p><span>In all likelihood, you will not make the next billion-dollar nonprofit. You will not make the next billion-dollar business. You will not become the next congressperson in your district. This does not mean that you have not done a good job. It should not demoralize you in any way once you fail hardly to do these things.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Finally, I would like to ponder on what happens once or if one does decide they have changed the world. What now? Should one change it again?</p>\n<p><span>It\u2019s not obvious.\u00a0 Many retire or settle down after feeling accomplished.\u00a0 However, this is exactly when trying is the most important.\u00a0 People with the best histories have the best potentials.\u00a0 No matter how much a U.S. President may achieve, they still can achieve significantly more after the end of their terms.\u00a0 There is no \u2018enough\u2019 line for human accomplishment.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>In summary the phrase change the world provides a lack of clear direction and encourages black-and-white thinking that distorts behaviors and motivation.\u00a0 However, I do believe that the phrase can act as a stepping stone towards a more concrete goal.\u00a0 \u2018Change the World\u2019 can act as an idea that requires a philosophical continuation.\u00a0 It\u2019s a start for a goal, but it should be recognized that it\u2019s far from a good ending.</span></p>\n<p><span>Next time someone tells you about \u2018changing the world\u2019, ask them to follow through with telling you the specifics of what they mean.\u00a0 Make sure that they understand that they need to go further in order to mean anything. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p>And more importantly, do this for yourself.\u00a0 Choose a specific axiomatic philosophy or set of philosophies and aim towards those.\u00a0 Your ultimate goal in life is too important to be based on an empty marketing term.</p></div></div>"},

It's also <a href=\"https://effectivereaction.wordpress.com/2014/12/31/blind-spots-compartmentalizing/\">on my blog</a>; apologies if some of the formatting hasn't copied across.</p>\n<p><em>Summary: People frequently compartmentalize their beliefs, and avoid addressing the implications between them. Ordinarily, this is perhaps innocuous, but when the both ideas are highly morally important, their interaction is in turn important \u2013 many standard arguments on both sides of moral issues like the permissibility of abortion are significantly undermined or otherwise effected by EA considerations, especially moral uncertainty. </em></p>\n<p>A long time ago, Will wrote an article about how a <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/2l6/taking_ideas_seriously/\"><span>key part of rationality was taking ideas seriously</span></a>: fully exploring ideas, seeing all their consequences, and then acting upon them. This is something most of us do not do! I for one certainly have trouble.</p>\n<p>Similarly, I think people selectively apply EA principles. People are very willing to apply them in some cases, but when those principles would cut at a core part of the person\u2019s identity \u2013 <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lbn/you_have_a_set_amount_of_weirdness_points_spend/\"><span>like requiring them to dress appropriately so they seem less weird</span></a> \u2013 people are much less willing to take those EA ideas to their logical conclusion.</p>\n<p>Consider your personal views. I\u2019ve certainly changed some of my opinions as a result of thinking about EA ideas. For example, my opinion of bednet distribution is now much higher than it once was. And I\u2019ve learned a lot about how to think about some technical issues, like <a href=\"/ea/bb/expected_value_estimates_you_can_take_somewhat/\"><span>regression to the mean</span></a>. Yet I realized that I had rarely done a full 180\u00a0 \u2013 and I think this is true of many people:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many think EA ideas argue for more foreign aid \u2013 but did anyone come to this conclusion who had previously been passionately anti-aid?</li>\n<li>Many think EA ideas argue for vegetarianism \u2013 but did anyone come to this conclusion who had previously been passionately carnivorous?</li>\n<li>Many think EA ideas argue against domestic causes \u2013 but did anyone come to this conclusion who had previously been a passionate nationalist?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yet this is quite worrying. Given the power and scope of many EA ideas, it seems that they should lead to people changing their mind on issues were they had been previously very certain, and indeed emotionally involved. That they have not suggests we have been <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/gv/outside_the_laboratory/\"><span>compartmentalizing</span></a>.</p>\n<p>Obviously we don\u2019t need to apply EA principles to everything \u2013 we can probably continue to brush our teeth without need for much reflection. But we probably should apply them to issues with are seen as being very important: given the importance of the issues, any implications of EA ideas would probably be important implications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Moral_Uncertainty\">Moral Uncertainty</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf\"><span>his PhD thesis</span></a>, Will MacAskill argues that we should treat normative uncertainty in much the same way as ordinary positive uncertainty; we should assign credences (probabilities) to each theory, and then try to maximise the expected morality of our actions. He calls this idea \u2018maximise expected choice-worthiness\u2019, and if you\u2019re into philosophy, I recommend reading the paper. As such, when deciding how to act we should give greater weight to the theories we consider more likely to be true, and also give more weight to theories that consider the issue to be of greater importance.</p>\n<p>This is important because it means that a novel view does not have to be totally persuasive to demand our observance. Consider, for example, vegetarianism. Maybe you think there\u2019s only a 10% chance that animal welfare is morally significant \u2013 you\u2019re pretty sure they\u2019re tasty for a reason. Yet if the consequences of eating meat are very bad in those 10% of cases (murder or torture, if the animal rights activists are correct), and the advantages are not very great in the other 90% (tasty, some nutritional advantages), we should not eat meat regardless. Taking into account the size of the issue at stake as well as probability of its being correct means paying more respect to \u2018minority\u2019 theories.</p>\n<p>And this is more of an issue for EAs than for most people. Effective Altruism involves a group of novel moral premisses, like <a href=\"http://ea-forum.trikeapps.com/ea/6w/cosmopolitanism/\"><span>cosmopolitanism</span></a>, <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/70/the_moral_imperative_towards_costeffectiveness/\"><span>the moral imperative for cost-effectiveness</span></a> and <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2013/07/17/beckstead-interview/\"><span>the importance of the far future</span></a>. Each of these imply that our decisions are in some way very important, so even if we assign them only a small credence, their plausibility implies radical revisions to our actions.</p>\n<p>One issue that Will touches on in his thesis is the issue of whether fetuses morally count. In the same way that we have moral uncertainty as to whether animals, or people in the far future, count, so too we have moral uncertainty as to whether unborn children are morally significant. Yes, many people are confident they know the correct answer \u2013 but there many of these on each side of the issue. Given the degree of disagreement on the issue, among <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1988647\"><span>philosophers</span></a>, politicians and the general public, it seems like the perfect example of an issue where moral uncertainty should be taken into account \u2013 indeed Will uses it as a canonical example.</p>\n<p>Consider the case of a pregnant women Sarah, wondering whether it is morally permissible to abort her child<sup><a href=\"https://effectivereaction.wordpress.com/?p=160&amp;preview=true#fn-160-1\">1</a></sup>. The alternative course of action she is considering is putting the child up for adoption. In accordance with the level of social and philosophical debate on the issue, she is uncertain as to whether aborting the fetus is morally permissible. If it\u2019s morally permissible, it\u2019s <em>merely</em> permissible \u2013 it\u2019s not obligatory. She follows the example from <em>Normative Uncertainty</em> and constructs the following table</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/abortion-table-1.png\"><img src=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/abortion-table-1.png?w=334&amp;h=107\" alt=\"abortion table 1\"></a></p>\n<p>In the best case scenario, abortion has nothing to recommend it, as adoption is also permissible. In the worst case, abortion is actually impermissible, whereas adoption is permissible. As such, adoption <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_dominance\"><span>dominates</span></a> abortion.</p>\n<p>However, Sarah might not consider this representation as adequate. In particular, she thinks that now is not the best time to have a child, and would prefer to avoid it.<sup><a href=\"https://effectivereaction.wordpress.com/?p=160&amp;preview=true#fn-160-2\">2</a></sup> She has made plans which are inconsistent with being pregnant, and prefers not to give birth at the current time. So she amends the table to take into account these preferences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/abortion-table-2.png\"><img src=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/abortion-table-2.png?w=300&amp;h=107\" alt=\"abortion table 2\"></a></p>\n<p>Now adoption no longer strictly dominates abortion, because she prefers abortion to adoption in the scenario where it is morally permissible. As such, she considers her credence: she considers the pro-choice arguments slightly more persuasive than the pro-life ones: she assigns a 70% credence to abortion being morally permissible, but only a 30% chance to its being morally impermissible.</p>\n<p>Looking at the table with these numbers in mind, intuitively it seems that again it\u2019s not worth the risk of abortion: a 70% chance of saving oneself inconvenience and temporary discomfort is not sufficient to justify a 30% chance of committing murder. But Sarah\u2019s unsatisfied with this unscientific comparison: it doesn\u2019t seem to have much of a theoretical basis, and she distrusts appeals to intuitions in cases like this. What is more, Sarah is something of a utilitarian; she doesn\u2019t really believe in something being impermissible.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there\u2019s a standard tool for making inter-personal welfare comparisons: QALYs. We can convert the previous table into QALYs, with the moral uncertainty now being expressed as uncertainty as to whether saving fetuses generates QALYs. If it does, then it generates a lot; supposing she\u2019s at the end of her first trimester, if she doesn\u2019t abort the baby it has a <a href=\"http://spacefem.com/pregnant/mc.php?m=08&amp;d=10&amp;y=12\"><span>98% chance of surviving to birth</span></a>, at which point its <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm\"><span>life expectancy is 78.7 in the US</span></a>, for 78.126 QALYs. This calculation assumes assigns no QALYs to the fetus\u2019s 6 months of existence between now and birth. If fetuses are not worthy of ethical consideration, then it accounts for 0 QALYs.</p>\n<p>We also need to assign QALYs to Sarah. For an upper bound, being pregnant is probably not much worse than having both your legs amputated without medication, which is <a href=\"/ea/7g/disability_weights/\"><span>0.494 QALYs</span></a>, so lets conservatively say 0.494 QALYs. She has an expected 6 months of pregnancy remaining, so we divide by 2 to get 0.247 QALYs. Women\u2019s Health Magazine gives the odds of maternal death during childbirth at <a href=\"http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/women-dying-in-childbirth\"><span>0.03% for 2013</span></a>; we\u2019ll round up to 0.05% to take into account risk of non-death injury. Women at 25 have a remaining life expectancy of <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus11.pdf#fig32\"><span>around 58 years</span></a>, so thats 0.05%*58= 0.029 QALYs. In total that gives us an estimate of 0.276 QALYs. If the baby doesn\u2019t survive to birth, however, some of these costs will not be incurred, so the truth is probably slightly lower than this. All in all a 0.276 QALYs seems like a reasonably conservative figure.</p>\n<p>Obviously you could refine these numbers a lot (for example, years of old age are likely to be at lower quality of life, there are some medical risks to the mother from aborting a fetus, etc.) but they\u2019re plausibly in the right ballpark. They would also change if we used inherent temporal discounting, but probably <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/n2/against_discount_rates/\"><span>we shouldn\u2019t</span></a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/abortion-table-3.png\"><img src=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/abortion-table-3.png?w=291&amp;h=93\" alt=\"abortion table 3\"></a></p>\n<p>We can then take into account her moral uncertainty directly, and calculate the expected QALYs of each action:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If she aborts the fetus, our expected QALYs are 70%<em>x0 + 30%</em>(-78.126) = -23.138</li>\n<li>If she carries the baby to term and puts it up for adoption, our expected QALYs are 70%<em>(-0.247) + 30%</em>(-0.247) = -0.247</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Which again suggests that the moral thing to do is to not abort the baby. Indeed, the life expectancy is so long at birth that it quite easily dominates the calculation: Sarah would have to be extremely confident in rejecting the value of the fetus to justify aborting it. So, mindful of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect\"><span>overconfidence bias</span></a>, she decides to carry the child to term.</p>\n<p>Indeed, we can show just how confident in the lack of moral significance of the fetuses one would have to be to justify aborting one. Here is a sensitivity table, showing credence in moral significance of fetuses on the y axis, and the direct QALY cost of pregnancy on the x axis for a wide range of possible values. The direct QALY cost of pregnancy is obviously bounded above by its limited duration. As is immediately apparent, one has to be very confident in fetuses lacking moral significance, and pregnancy has to be very bad, before aborting a fetus becomes even slightly QALY-positive. For moderate values, it is extremely QALY-negative.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/abortion-table-4.png\"><img src=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/abortion-table-4.png?w=420&amp;h=175\" alt=\"abortion table 4\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"Other_EA_concepts_and_their_applications_to_this_issue\">Other EA concepts and their applications to this issue</h3>\n<p>Of course, moral uncertainty is not the only EA principle that could have bearing on the issue, and given that the theme of this blogging carnival, and this post, is things we\u2019re overlooking, it would be remiss not to give at least a broad overview of some of the others. Here, I don\u2019t intend to judge how persuasive any given argument is \u2013 as we discussed above, this is a debate that has been going without settlement for thousands of years \u2013 but merely to show the ways that common EA arguments affect the plausibility of the different arguments. This is a section about the directionality of EA concerns, not on the overall magnitudes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Not_really_people\">Not really people</h4>\n<p>One of the most important arguments for the permissibility of abortion is that fetuses are in some important sense \u2018not really people\u2019. In many ways this argument resembles the anti-animal rights argument that animals are also \u2018not really people\u2019. We already covered above the way that considerations of moral uncertainty undermine both these arguments, but it\u2019s also noteworthy that in general it seems that the two views are mutually supporting (or mutually undermining, if both are false). Animal-rights advocates often appeal to the idea of an \u2018expanding circle\u2019 of moral concern. I\u2019m <a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/The%20Narrowing%20Circle\"><span>skeptical of such an argument</span></a>, but it seems clear that the larger your sphere, the more likely fetuses are to end up on the inside. The fact that, in the US at least, animal activists tend to be pro-abortion seems to be more of a historical accident than anything else. We could imagine alternative-universe political coalitions, where a \u201cDefend the Weak; They\u2019re morally valuable too\u201d party faced off against a \u201cExploit the Weak; They just don\u2019t count\u201d party. In general, to the extent that EAs care about animal suffering (even <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/do-bugs-feel-pain/\"><span>insect suffering</span></a> ), EAs should tend to be concerned about the welfare of the unborn.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Not_people_yet\">Not people yet</h4>\n<p>A slightly different common argument is that while fetuses will eventually be people, they\u2019re not people yet. Since they\u2019re not people right now, we don\u2019t have to pay any attention to their rights or welfare right now. Indeed, many people make short sighted decisions that implicitly assign very little value to the futures of people currently alive, or even to their own futures \u2013 through self-destructive drug habits, or simply failing to save for retirement. If we don\u2019t assign much value to our own futures, it seems very sensible to disregard the futures of those not even born. And even if people who disregarded their own futures were simply negligent, we might still be concerned about things like the <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonidentity-problem/\"><span>non-identity problem</span></a>.</p>\n<p>Yet it seems that EAs are almost uniquely unsuited to this response. EAs do tend to care explicitly about future generations. We put considerable resources into investigating how to help them, whether through addressing <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-08-08/less-burn-for-your-buck-which-climate-charities-are-most-effective-in-reducing\"><span>climate change</span></a> or <a href=\"http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdfbostrom\"><span>existential risks</span></a>. And yet these people have far less of a claim to current personhood than fetuses, who at least have current physical form, even if it is diminutive. So again to the extent that EAs care about future welfare, EAs should tend to be concerned about the welfare of the unborn.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Replaceability\">Replaceability</h4>\n<p>Another important EA idea is that of <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/replaceability\"><span>replaceability</span></a>. Typically this arises in contexts of career choice, but there is a different application here. The QALYs associated with aborted children might not be so bad if the mother will go on to have another child instead. If she does, the net QALY loss is much lower than the gross QALY loss. Of course, the benefits of aborting the fetus are equivalently much smaller \u2013 if she has a child later on instead, she will have to bear the costs of pregnancy eventually anyway. This resembles concerns that maybe <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/04/17/david-roodmans-draft-writeup-on-the-mortality-fertility-connection/\"><span>saving children in Africa doesn\u2019t make much difference, because their parents adjust their subsequent fertility.</span></a></p>\n<p>The plausibility behind this idea comes from the idea that, at least in the US, most families have a certain ideal number of children in mind, and basically achieve this goal. As such, missing an opportunity to have an early child simply results in having another later on.</p>\n<p>If this were fully true, utilitarians might decide that abortion actually has no QALY impact at all \u2013 all it does is change the timing of events. On the other hand, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_and_female_fertility\"><span>fertility declines with age</span></a>, so many couples planning to have a replacement child later may be unable to do so. Also, some people do not have ideal family size plans.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this does not really seem to hold when the alternative is adoption; presumably a woman putting a child up for adoption does not consider it as part of her family, so her future childbearing would be unaffected. This argument might hold if raising the child yourself was the only alternative, but given that adoption services are available, it does not seem to go through.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Autonomy\">Autonomy</h4>\n<p>Sometimes people argue for the permissibility of abortion through autonomy arguments. \u201cIt is my body\u201d, such an argument would go, \u201ctherefore I may do whatever I want with it.\u201d To a certain extent this argument is addressed by pointing out that one\u2019s bodily rights presumably do not extent to killing others, so if the anti-abortion side are correct, or even have a non-trivial probability of being correct, autonomy would be insufficient. It seems that if the autonomy argument is to work, it must be because a different argument has established the non-personhood of fetuses \u2013 in which case the autonomy argument is redundant. Yet even putting this aside, this argument is less appealing to EAs than to non-EAs, because EAs often hold a distinctly non-libertarian account of personal ethics. We believe it is actually good to help people (and avoid hurting them), and perhaps that it is bad to avoid doing so. And many EAs are utilitarians, for whom helping/not-hurting is not merely laud-worthy but actually compulsory. EAs are generally not very impressed with <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/abortion.html\"><span>Ayn Rand style autonomy arguments</span></a> for rejecting charity, so again EAs should tend to be unsympathetic to autonomy arguments for the permissibility of abortion.</p>\n<p>Indeed, some EAs even think we should be legally obliged to act in good ways, whether through laws against factory farming or tax-funded foreign aid.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Deontology\">Deontology</h4>\n<p>An argument often used on the opposite side\u00a0 \u2013 that is, an argument used to oppose abortion, is that abortion is murder, and murder is simply always wrong. Whether because <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_shall_not_murder\"><span>God commanded it</span></a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantian_ethics\"><span>Kant derived it</span></a>, we should place the utmost importance of never murdering. I\u2019m not sure that any EA principle <em>directly</em> pulls against this, but nonetheless most EAs are consequentialists, who believe that all values can be compared. If aborting one child would save a million others, most EAs would probably endorse the abortion. So I think this is one case where a common EA view pulls in favor of the permissibility of abortion.</p>\n<h4 id=\"I_didn_t_ask_for_this\">I didn\u2019t ask for this</h4>\n<p>Another argument often used for the permissibility of abortion is that the situation is in some sense unfair. If one did not intend to become pregnant \u2013 perhaps even took precautions to avoid becoming so \u2013 but nonetheless ends up pregnant, you\u2019re in some way not responsible for becoming pregnant. And since you\u2019re not responsible for it you have no obligations concerning it \u2013 so may permissible abort the fetus.</p>\n<p>However, once again this runs counter to a major strand of EA thought. Most of us did not ask to be born in rich countries, or to be intelligent, or hardworking. Perhaps it was simply luck. Yet being in such a position nonetheless means we have certain opportunities and obligations. Specifically, we have the opportunity to use of wealth to significantly aid those less fortunate than ourselves in the developing world, and many EAs would agree the obligation. So EAs seem to reject the general idea that not intending a situation relieves one of the responsibilities of that situation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Infanticide_is_okay_too\">Infanticide is okay too</h4>\n<p>A frequent argument against the permissibility of aborting fetuses is by analogy to infanticide. In general <a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/An%20Abortion%20Dialogue\"><span>it is hard to produce a coherent criteria that permits the killing of babies before birth but forbids it after birth</span></a>. For most people, this is a reasonably compelling objection: murdering innocent babies is clearly evil! Yet some EAs actually <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1993----.htm\"><span>endorse infanticide</span></a>. If you were one of those people, this particular argument would have little sway over you.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Moral_Universalism\">Moral Universalism</h4>\n<p>A common implicit premise in many moral discussion is that the same moral principles apply to everyone. When Sarah did her QALY calculation, she counted the baby\u2019s QALYs as equally important to her own in the scenario where they counted at all. Similarly, both sides of the debate assume that whatever the answer is, it will apply fairly broadly. Perhaps permissibility varies by age of the fetus \u2013 maybe ending <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability#Scientific_thresholds\"><span>when viability hits</span></a> \u2013 but the same answer will apply to rich and poor, Christian and Jew, etc.</p>\n<p>This is something some EAs might reject. Yes, saving the baby produces many more QALYs than Sarah loses through the pregnancy, and that would be the end of the story if Sarah were simply an ordinary person. But Sarah is an EA, and so has a much higher opportunity cost for her time. Becoming pregnant will undermine her career as an investment banker, the argument would go, which in turn prevents her from donating to AMF and saving a great many lives. Because of this, Sarah is in a special position \u2013 it is permissible for her, but it would not be permissible for someone who wasn\u2019t saving many lives a year.</p>\n<p>I think this is a pretty repugnant attitude in general, and a particularly objectionable instance of it, but I include it here for completeness.</p>\n<h3 id=\"May_we_discuss_this_\">May we discuss this?</h3>\n<p>Now we\u2019ve considered these arguments, it appears that applying general EA principles to the issue in general tends to make abortion look less morally permissible, though there were one or two exceptions. But there is also a second order issue that we should perhaps address \u2013 is it permissible to discuss this issue at all?</p>\n<h4 id=\"Nothing_to_do_with_you\">Nothing to do with you</h4>\n<p>A frequently seen argument on this issue is to claim that <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/i-helped-shut-down-an-abortion-debate-between-two-men-because-my-uterus-isnt-up-for-their-discussion-9867200.html\"><span>the speaker has no right to opine on the issue</span></a>. If it doesn\u2019t personally affect you, you cannot discuss it \u2013 especially if you\u2019re privileged. As many (a majority?) of EAs are male, and of the women many are not pregnant, this would curtail dramatically the ability of EAs to discuss abortion. This is not so much an argument on one side or other of the issue as an argument for silence.</p>\n<p>Leaving aside the inherent virtues and vices of this argument, it is not very suitable for EAs. Because EAs have many many opinions on topics that don\u2019t directly affect them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EAs have opinions on disease in Africa, yet most have never been to Africa, and never will</li>\n<li>EAs have opinions on (non-human) animal suffering, yet most are not non-human animals</li>\n<li>EAs have opinions on the far future, yet live in the present</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Indeed, EAs seem <em>more</em> qualified to comment on abortion \u2013 as we all were once fetuses, and many of us will become pregnant. If taken seriously this argument would call foul on virtually ever EA activity! And this is no idle fantasy \u2013 there are certainly some people who think that <a href=\"http://www.dambisamoyo.com/books-and-publications/book/dead-aid/\"><span>Westerns cannot usefully contribute to solving African poverty</span></a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Too_controversial\">Too controversial</h4>\n<p>We can safely say this is a somewhat controversial issue. Perhaps it is too controversial \u2013 maybe it is bad for the movement to discuss. One might accept the arguments above \u2013 that EA principles generally undermine the traditional reasons for thinking abortion is morally permissible \u2013 yet think we should not talk about it. The controversy might divide the community and undermine trust. Perhaps it might deter newcomers. I\u2019m somewhat sympathetic to this argument \u2013 I take the <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/14/the-virtue-of-silence/\"><span>virtue of silence</span></a> seriously, though eventually my boyfriend persuaded me it was worth publishing.</p>\n<p>Note that the controversial nature is evidence <em>against</em> abortion\u2019s moral permissibility, due to moral uncertainty.</p>\n<p>However, the EA movement is no stranger to controversy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a semi-official EA position on immigration, which is about as controversial as abortion in the US at the moment, and the EA position is such an extreme position that essentially no mainstream politicians hold it.</li>\n<li>There is a semi-official EA position on vegetarianism, which is pretty controversial too, as it involves implying that the majority of Americans are complicit in murder every day.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"Not_worthy_of_discussion\">Not worthy of discussion</h4>\n<p>Finally, another objection to discussing this is it simply it\u2019s an EA idea. There are many disagreements in the world, yet there is no need for an EA view on each. Conflict between the Lilliputians and Blefuscudians notwithstanding, there is no need for an EA perspective on which end of the egg to break first. And we should be especially careful of heated, emotional topics with less avenue to <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/05/policy_tugowar.html\"><span>pull the rope sideways</span></a>. As such, even though the object-level arguments given above are correct, we should simply decline to discuss it.</p>\n<p>However, it seems that if abortion is a moral issue, it is a very large one. In the same way that the sheer number of QALYs lost makes abortion worse than adoption even if our credence in fetuses having moral significance was very low, the large number of abortions occurring each year make the issue as a whole of high significance. In 2011 there were <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/psrh.46e0414.pdf\"><span>over 1 million babies were aborted in the US</span></a>. I\u2019ve seen a wide range of global estimates, including <a href=\"http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/wrjp3313.html\">around 10 million</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/Abortion-Worldwide.pdf\"><span>over 40 million</span></a>. By contrast, the WHO estimates there are <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/malaria/epidemic/deaths/en/\"><span>fewer than 1 million malaria deaths worldwide</span></a> each year. Abortion deaths also cause a higher loss of QALYs due to the young age at which they occur. On the other hand, we should discount them for the uncertainty that they are morally significant. And perhaps there is <a href=\"http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/papers/scourge.pdf\"><span>an even larger closely related moral issue</span></a>. The size of the issue is not the only <a href=\"/ea/cr/factoring_costeffectiveness/\"><span>factor</span></a> in estimating the cost-effectiveness of interventions, but it is the most easily estimable. On the other hand, I have little idea how many dollars of donations it takes to save a fetus \u2013 it seems like an excellent example of some low-hanging fruit research.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>People frequently compartmentalize their beliefs, and avoid addressing the implications between them. Ordinarily, this is perhaps innocuous, but when the both ideas are highly morally important, their interaction is in turn important. In this post we the implications of common EA beliefs on the permissibility of abortion. Taking into account moral uncertainty makes aborting a fetus seem far less permissible, as the high counterfactual life expectancy of the baby tends to dominate other factors. Many other EA views are also significant to the issue, making various standard arguments on each side less plausible.</p>\n<div>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li> There doesn\u2019t seem to be any neutral language one can use here, so I\u2019m just going to switch back and forth between \u2018fetus\u2019 and \u2018child\u2019 or \u2018baby\u2019 in a vain attempt at terminological neutrality.\u00a0 </li>\n<li> I chose this reason because it is the <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3711005.pdf\"><span>most frequently cited main motivation for aborting a fetus</span></a> according to the Guttmacher Institute.\u00a0 </li>\n</ol></div></div></div>"},

I think those issues are more important, but I\u2019m just taking on one piece of the puzzle that has to do with moral philosophy, where I thought I could quickly explain something that may help people think through the issues.</p><p>In outline form, my argument is as follows:\n</p><ol>\n\t<li>In very ordinary resource conservation cases that are easy to think about, it is clearly important to ensure that the lives of future generations go well, and it\u2019s natural to think that the importance scales linearly with the number of future people whose lives will be affected by the conservation work.</li>\n\t<li>By analogy, it is important to ensure that, if humanity does survive into the distant future, its trajectory is as good as possible, and the importance of shaping the long-term future scales roughly linearly with the expected number of people in the future.</li>\n\t<li>Premise (2), when combined with the standard set of (admittedly debatable) empirical and decision-theoretic assumptions of the astronomical waste argument, yields the standard conclusion of that argument: shaping the long-term future is overwhelmingly important.</li>\n</ol>\nAs when I have discussed this issue in other contexts (such as Nick Bostrom\u2019s papers \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html\">Astronomical Waste</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdf\">Existential Risk Prevention as Global Priority</a>,\u201d and my dissertation) this conversation is going to generally assume that we\u2019re talking about good accomplished from an impartial perspective, and will not attend to deontological, virtue-theoretic, or justice-related considerations.\n<h1 id=\"A_review_of_the_astronomical_waste_argument_and_an_adjustment_to_it\">A review of the astronomical waste argument and an adjustment to it</h1>\nThe standard version of the astronomical waste argument runs as follows:\n<ol>\n\t<li>The expected size of humanity's future influence is astronomically great.</li>\n\t<li>If the expected size of humanity's future influence is astronomically great, then the expected value of the future is astronomically great.</li>\n\t<li>If\u00a0the expected value of the future is astronomically great, then what matters most is that we maximize humanity\u2019s long-term potential.</li>\n\t<li>Some of our actions are expected to reduce existential risk in not-ridiculously-small ways.</li>\n\t<li>If what matters most is that we maximize humanity\u2019s future potential and some of our actions are expected to reduce existential risk in not-ridiculously-small ways, what it is best to do is primarily determined by how our actions are expected to reduce existential risk.</li>\n\t<li>Therefore, what it is best to do is primarily determined by how our actions are expected to reduce existential risk.</li>\n</ol>\nI\u2019ve <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hjb/a_proposed_adjustment_to_the_astronomical_waste/\">argued</a> for adjusting the last three steps of this argument in the following way:\n<p>4\u2019. \u00a0 Some of our actions are expected to change our development trajectory in not-ridiculously-small ways.</p>\n<p>5\u2019. \u00a0 If what matters most is that we maximize humanity\u2019s future potential and some of our actions are expected to change our development trajectory in not-ridiculously-small ways, what it is best to do is primarily determined by how our actions are expected to change our development trajectory.</p>\n<p>6\u2019. \u00a0 Therefore, what it is best to do is primarily determined by how our actions are expected to change our development trajectory.</p>\nThe basic thought here is that what the astronomical waste argument really shows is that future welfare considerations swamp short-term considerations, so that long-term consequences for the distant future are overwhelmingly important in comparison with purely short-term considerations (apart from <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/flow-through-effects-conversation\">long-term consequences</a> that short-term consequences may produce).\n<h1 id=\"Astronomical_waste_may_involve_changes_in_quality_of_life__rather_than_size_of_population\">Astronomical waste may involve changes in quality of life, rather than size of population</h1>\nOften, the astronomical waste argument is combined with the idea that the best way to minimize astronomical waste is to minimize the probability of pre-mature human extinction. How important it is to prevent pre-mature human extinction is a subject of philosophical <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0114.00150/abstract\">debate</a>, and the debate largely rests on whether it is important to allow large numbers of people to exist in the future. So when someone complains that the astronomical waste argument rests on esoteric assumptions about moral philosophy, they are implicitly objecting to premise (2) or (3). They are saying that even if human influence on the future is astronomically great, maybe changing how well humanity exercises its long-term potential isn\u2019t very important because maybe it isn\u2019t important to ensure that there are a large number of people living in the future.<p></p><p>However, the concept of existential risk is wide enough to include any drastic curtailment to humanity\u2019s long-term potential, and the concept of a \u201ctrajectory change\u201d is wide enough to include any small but important change in humanity\u2019s long-term development. And the value of these existential risks or trajectory changes need not depend on changes in the population. For example,\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>In \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html\">The Future of Human Evolution</a>,\u201d Nick Bostrom discusses a scenario in which evolutionary dynamics result in substantial decreases in quality of for all future generations, and the main problem is not a population deficit.</li>\n\t<li>Paul Christiano <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2014/05/14/machine-intelligence-and-capital-accumulation/\">outlined</a> long-term resource inequality as a possible consequence of developing advanced machine intelligence.</li>\n\t<li>I discussed various specific trajectory changes in a <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hjb/a_proposed_adjustment_to_the_astronomical_waste/92m0\">comment</a> on an essay mentioned above.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"There_is_limited_philosophical_debate_about_the_importance_of_changes_in_the_quality_of_life_of_future_generations\">There is limited philosophical debate about the importance of changes in the quality of life of future generations</h1>\nThe main group of people who deny that it is important that future people exist have \u201cperson-affecting views.\u201d These people claim that if I must choose between outcome A and outcome B, and person X exists in outcome A but not outcome B, it\u2019s not possible to affect person X by choosing outcome A rather than B. Because of this, they claim that causing people to exist can\u2019t benefit them and isn\u2019t important. I think this view suffers from fatal objections which I have discussed in chapter 4 of my dissertation, and you can check that out if you want to learn more. But, for the sake of argument, let\u2019s agree that creating \u201cextra\u201d people can\u2019t help the people created and isn\u2019t important.<p></p><p>A puzzle for people with person-affecting views goes as <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonidentity-problem/\">follows</a>:\n</p><blockquote>Suppose that agents as a community have chosen to deplete rather than conserve certain resources. The consequences of that choice for the persons who exist now or will come into existence over the next two centuries will be \u201cslightly higher\u201d than under a conservation alternative (Parfit 1987, 362; see also Parfit 2011 (vol. 2), 218). Thereafter, however, for many centuries the quality of life would be much lower. \u201cThe great lowering of the quality of life must provide some moral reason not to choose Depletion\u201d (Parfit 1987, 363). Surely agents ought to have chosen conservation in some form or another instead. But note that, at the same time, depletion seems to harm\u00a0<em>no one</em>. While distant future persons, by hypothesis, will suffer as a result of depletion, it is also true that for each such person a conservation choice (very probably) would have changed the timing and manner of the relevant conception. That change, in turn, would have changed the identities of the people conceived and the identities of the people who eventually exist. Any suffering, then, that they endure under the depletion choice would seem to be unavoidable if those persons are ever to exist at all. Assuming (here and throughout) that that existence is worth having, we seem forced to conclude that depletion does not harm, or make things worse for, and is not otherwise \u201cbad for,\u201d anyone at all (Parfit 1987, 363). At least: depletion does not harm, or make things worse for, and is not \"bad for,\" anyone who does or will exist\u00a0<em>under the depletion choice</em>.</blockquote>\nThe seemingly natural thing to say if you have a person-affecting view is that because conservation doesn\u2019t benefit anyone, it isn\u2019t important. But this is a very strange thing to say, and people having this conversation generally recognize that saying it involves biting a bullet. The general tenor of the conversation is that conservation is obviously important in this example, and people with person-affecting views need to provide an explanation consonant with that intuition.<p></p><p>Whatever the ultimate philosophical justification, I think we should say that choosing conservation in the above example is important, and this has something to do with the fact that choosing conservation has consequences that are relevant to the quality of life of many future people.\n</p><h1 id=\"Intuitively__giving_N_times_as_many_future_people_higher_quality_of_life_is_N_times_as_important\">Intuitively, giving N times as many future people higher quality of life is N times as important</h1>\nSuppose that conservation would have consequences relevant to 100 times as many people in case A than it would in case B. How much more important would conservation be in case A? Intuitively, it would be 100 times more important. This generally fits with Holden Karnofsky\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/modeling-extreme-model-uncertainty\">intuition</a> that a 1/N probability of saving N lives is about as important as saving one life, for any N:\n<blockquote>I wish to be the sort of person who would happily pay $1 for a robust (reliable, true, correct) 10/N probability of saving N lives, for astronomically huge N - while simultaneously refusing to pay $1 to a random person on the street claiming s/he will save N lives with it.</blockquote>\nMore generally, we could say:\n<p>Principle of Scale: Other things being equal, it is N times better (in itself) to ensure that N people in some position have higher quality of life than other people who would be in their position than it is to do this for one person.</p>\nI had to state the principle circuitously to avoid saying that things like conservation programs could \u201chelp\u201d future generations, because according to people with person-affecting views, if our \"helping\" changes the identities of future people, then we aren't \"helping\" anyone and that's\u00a0relevant. If I had said it in ordinary language, the principle would have said, \u201cIf you can help N people, that\u2019s N times better than helping one person.\u201d The principle could use some tinkering to deal with concerns about equality and so on, but it will serve well enough for our purposes.<p></p><p>The Principle of Scale may seem obvious, but even it would be debatable. You wouldn\u2019t find philosophical agreement about it. For example, some philosophers who claim that additional lives have diminishing marginal value would claim that in situations where many people already exist, it matters much less if a person is helped. I attack these perspectives in chapter 5 of my dissertation, and you can check that out if you want to learn more. But, in any case, the Principle of Scale does seem pretty compelling\u2014especially if you\u2019re the kind of person that doesn\u2019t have time for esoteric debates about population ethics\u2014so let\u2019s run with it.</p><p>Now for the most questionable steps: Let\u2019s assume with the astronomical waste argument that the expected number of future people is overwhelming, and that it is possible to improve the quality of life for an overwhelming number of future people through forward-thinking interventions. If we combine this with the principle from the last paragraph and wave our hands a bit, we get the conclusion that shifting quality of life for an overwhelming number of future people is overwhelmingly more important than any short term consideration. And that is very close to what the long-run perspective says about helping future generations, though importantly different because this version of the argument might not put weight on preventing extinction. (I say \u201cmight not\u201d rather than \u201cwould not\u201d because if you disagree with the people with person-affecting views but accept the Principle of Scale outlined above, you might just accept the usual conclusion of the astronomical waste argument.)\n</p><h1 id=\"Does_the_Principle_of_Scale_break_down_when_large_numbers_are_at_stake_\">Does the Principle of Scale break down when large numbers are at stake?</h1>\nI have no argument that it doesn\u2019t, but I note that (i) this wasn\u2019t Holden Karnofsky\u2019s intuition about saving N lives, (ii) it isn\u2019t mine, and (iii) I don\u2019t really see a compelling justification for it. The main reason I can think of for wanting it to break down is not liking the conclusion that affecting long-run outcomes for humanity is overwhelmingly important in comparison with short-term considerations.\u00a0 If you really want to avoid the conclusion that shaping the long-term future is overwhelmingly important, I believe it would be better to accommodate this idea by appealing to other perspectives and a framework for integrating the insights of different perspectives\u2014such as <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/06/10/sequence-thinking-vs-cluster-thinking/\">the one that Holden has talked about</a>\u2014rather than altering this perspective. For such people, my hope would be that reading this post would cause you to put more weight on the perspectives that place great importance on the future.\n<h1 id=\"Summary\">Summary</h1>\nTo wrap up, I\u2019ve argued that:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Reducing astronomical waste need not involve preventing human extinction\u2014it can involve other changes in humanity\u2019s long-term trajectory.</li>\n\t<li>While not widely discussed, the Principle of Scale is fairly attractive from an atheoretical standpoint.</li>\n\t<li>The Principle of Scale\u2014when combined with other standard assumptions in the literature on astronomical waste\u2014suggests that some trajectory changes would be overwhelmingly important in comparison with short-term considerations. It could be accepted by people who have person-affecting views or people who don\u2019t want to get too bogged down in esoteric debates about moral philosophy.</li>\n</ol>\nThe perspective I\u2019ve outlined here is still philosophically controversial, but it is at least somewhat independent of the standard approach to astronomical waste. Ultimately, any take on astronomical waste\u2014including ignoring it\u2014will be committed to philosophical assumptions of some kind, but perhaps the perspective outlined would be accepted more widely, especially by people with temperaments consonant with effective altruism, than perspectives relying on more specific theories or a larger number of principles.<p></p></div></div>"},

\u00a0Is the book actionable? \u00a0I personally aim to read books that come to me in reviews, that from a skim of their table of contents look like they'll provide real value to me.</p>\n<p><strong>I think about what else I could be doing instead of reading.</strong> \u00a0Reading is great, but in many cases experience can be a better teacher. \u00a0Moreover, picking up some experience can help me understand and apply the lessons in books better. \u00a0I try to adopt a \"doing-reading\" loop, where I read something, act upon it, then read another something, etc., continuing to iteratively improve in whatever skill I'm after. \u00a0This also helps validate the advice of books.</p>\n<p><strong>I'm not afraid to ditch an\u00a0underperforming\u00a0book. \u00a0</strong>If I don't like it, it's wasting my time, and it's time to move on.</p>\n<p><strong>I consider sources other than books.</strong> Books are often the best source of information on any topic, and are often higher quality because they're intensely reviewed. \u00a0But many blog posts and online resources can be great too. \u00a0I Ignore them at my own peril.</p>\n<p><strong>I read a summary, read the book, then re-read the summary.</strong>\u00a0 My favorite loop for retaining the main ideas of the book I read is to first find a high quality summary of the book and familiarize myself with the basic points. \u00a0Then I read the actual book. \u00a0Then, when I'm finished, I look back on the summary and remind myself of the key points and think of the examples that came up in the book. \u00a0Note that I can't just read the summary because summaries often only work to remind myself of the book and not to replace the book's content. \u00a0(Also note that this summary-read-summary loop might not work well with some books, like textbooks.)</p>\n<p><strong>I skim and read actively.</strong> If I'm hunting for information, there's no need to read every word on every page. \u00a0I feel free to skip through parts I already know, or when the author is belaboring the point too much. \u00a0Conversely, I re-read important sections.</p>\n<p><strong>I use Audible, Pocket, and Kindle.</strong>\u00a0 Even with the best of intentions, I never actually make the time to read. \u00a0Instead, I've found much more success with fitting reading into the gaps of my day. \u00a0I use <a href=\"http://www.audible.com\">Audible</a>\u00a0to listen to audiobooks when I'm exercising, cleaning, or commuting. \u00a0I use <a href=\"http://www.getpocket.com\">Pocket</a> on my phone to read blog posts when I'm standing in line or in the bathroom. \u00a0I use <a href=\"https://kindle.amazon.com/\">Kindle</a>\u00a0on my computer when I'm between tasks, or waiting for a program to run. \u00a0Substitute other apps as you see fit, but fill your time.</p>\n<p><strong>I take notes during, or at least after.</strong>\u00a0Ideally, I should be taking notes on what I read as I read them. \u00a0But this usually doesn't end up happening. \u00a0Either way, I aim to take some time after reading the book to summarize the book and internalize my lessons learned and figure out what it is about my life (and/or my research program) will be different after reading the book. \u00a0If I can't come up with an answer, I probably wasted my time reading the book.</p>\n<p><strong>I slow down to digest the books.</strong> \u00a0Many good books teach a lot at once, and I need to slow down to reflect upon each piece. \u00a0Many times, this means I have to take some time away from the book to reflect.</p></div></div>"},

These should keep being posted regularly. Additionally, we can also periodically post the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>'What Are You Working On?'</strong>: a (bi)monthly thread on which users can showcase their current activities. Of course, such a thread on this forum would be specific activity at least tangential to effective altruism. Still, it could act as a way for effective altruists to find collaborators, and other volunteers, a la\u00a0<a href=\"/dotimpact.im\">.impact</a>, or <a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/EA-Funding-Network-on-Gittip-Oy8CJBZfrGl\">have their projects funded by other effective altruists</a>, as Diego Caleiro, and Ozzie Gooen, have started doing.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>'Group Effective Altruism Diary'</strong>: Less Wrong has a group rationality diary.

Since instrumental rationality is useful advice for everyone, I recommend checking out that thread on Less Wrong itself. Anyway, we could have such a resource on this forum specific to effective altruism.

(transcript)", "author": "TopherHallquist", "num_comments": "5 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>[This is an edited transcript of a talk I gave back in June. It's more heavily edited once you get to the Q&amp;A session, to be more concise and organized than the actual Q&amp;A was. Some of the information may already be somewhat out of date, though I have corrected one or two minor errors.]</p>\n<p>Hi. My name is Chris, and in addition to being a member of Giving What We Can, I am a software developer working in San Francisco. But this was not my original career path. I started out getting to college. I thought I'd be pre-med, because it was for altruistic reasons. I wanted to join an organization like Doctors Without Borders and go do third world health stuff in the developing world to help people there. But this actually wasn't the best idea, in retrospect, for a couple of reasons. One of them is that I just hate memorizing anatomy and things like that.</p>\n<p>(One of the things that I'm still trying to figure out about things that have happened to me in my life is do other people who actually end up going to med school have some quirk that makes memorizing anatomy easy for them, or did I just hate it more because I wasn't good at math? Sorry. I was really good at math. Math was super easy for me, and then this memorization shit, man.)</p>\n<p>From there, I went into philosophy, which was also a mistake... I don't know, I just wrote a blog post about philosophy versus programming which you can <a href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/hallq/2014/06/philosophy-vs-programming/\">read</a>. I won't go on that rant here. But eventually found my way into programming and earning to give.</p>\n<p>In addition to not just being good at anatomy, the other problem with the whole be a doctor plan and join an organization like Doctors Without Borders, is that doctors are to a large extent replaceable, which may seem kind of funny to hear because we think doctors are really important.</p>\n<p>But they're replaceable in the economic sense that if you didn't do it, probably someone else would, like med school applications. Med school applications are super, super competitive. There's a shortage of doctors right now, but there's also a shortage of residencies, the first jobs you get after med school.</p>\n<p>The bottlenecks on having enough doctors in the world totally is not on enough people wanting to be doctors. It might be different for an organization like Doctors Without Borders, but I just wasn't even thinking in those terms when I was in high school applying to colleges, and then my first couple years at college. I had no idea whether the limiting factor on those organizations' ability to operate, was it talented people who wanted to do that or was the limiting factor money or was the limiting factor...? I had no idea.</p>\n<p>Whereas, say you're making $100,000 a year as a software developer and you donate 20 percent of that to organizations like <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com/\">AMF</a>. AMF may not be the best example, because as Tim talked about, there's <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Roomformorefunds\">issues with distributing money.</a> But at least back, when they had room for more funding, the estimate was that for every $2,000-odd dollars they spend, the estimate was they were saving one life.</p>\n<p>You do the math on donating 20 percent of $100,000 and you're saving eight or nine lives per year, which is really amazing. That's really hard to do and as a doctor you might see a lot of patients, but someone else would be very likely to be doing that. Whereas, with earning to give, that's not something that is replaceable in the economic sense, it's not true that if you weren't doing it, someone else would.</p>\n<p>Again, you reach some of those limits like AMF's funding issue, but even if you hit the limit on one organization's ability to receive funds, there are still other organizations out there, like GiveWell is currently recommending the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, which manages to give deworming treatments, the less sexy diseases like malaria that maybe get neglected. Neglected tropical disease, they're called.</p>\n<p>They provide these treatments for pennies on the dollar. Think, again, treating tens of thousands of people for these diseases that really suck. That wouldn't happen without your donation, which is super awesome.</p>\n<p>Whether this makes sense as a strategy for you depends a little bit on who you are. I suspect for a lot of smart, idealistic people, the odds are very, very good that this is something you should consider.</p>\n<p>Or even if you aren't super-talented, like having the talent to be a software engineer, you don't get programming. Programming is weird. Some people just get it and some people just don't. The people who do get it are super lucky.</p>\n<p>But even if you're making $30,000 a year, by global standards, that's a lot of money. Even donating 10 percent of that is a huge freaking deal from the perspective of charities that are working on Third World health.</p>\n<p>(I keep using Third World health as an example just because we know how to measure that, but potentially you could make a huge impact in other areas as well. I just keep using that as an example.)</p>\n<p>A lot of idealistically-minded people resist the idea of earning to give. I thought about doing it on my way out of philosophy grad school. I thought about going into law for that purpose. I didn't quite realize that computer programming might be an option for me, but lots of philosophy majors go into law. I thought about doing that. Didn't, partly because just being a law graduate isn't as good of a deal as it used to be. It's like medicine. There are tons and tons of people going into law and not enough entry-level jobs, etc., etc.</p>\n<p>Anyway, it's the thought of yourself directly doing good, being the guy out front, is really, really enticing for a lot of people. If you resist the idea of earning to give, you should interrogate why you're doing it. It might be right for you.</p>\n<p>I'm sure people directly working on things like GiveWell, doing that direct work, can have a huge impact. But I'm sure, for a lot of people in this room, you're maybe not in a position to do that kind of direct work. You should really take a hard look at earning to give as a career choice.</p>\n<p>Also, if you like the idea of the psychological feeling that you're doing something, and you want people to know that you're doing something, if you're earning to give, you are encouraged to brag about it, because the research says that if you brag it, if you tell other people you're donating to these charities, that makes them more likely to give themselves. From a pure pragmatic point of view, bragging is encouraged.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Opinion/Commentary/2008/Jun-19/116467-give-and-tell-in-defense-of-philanthropic-graffiti.ashx#axzz3DiKHav34\">Jesus was wrong</a> about this. Don't donate anonymously.</p>\n<p>There are huge, \"How do you go about picking a career?\" and \"Trading off earning to give versus other things\" questions, but the website <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a> has a ton of information on this stuff. One of the first things I would recommend doing is logging onto there.</p>\n<p>They have a lot of comparisons, case studies of people who are trying to decide what to do with their lives, different careers, both in terms of, \"Which career can I make more money in?\", or people trying to decide, \"Would I be better off earning to give versus, say, going into medical research? I think I might be able to make a big impact in medical research.\"</p>\n<p>A lot of these cases, it's tricky to figure out, but you'll be able to see information that other people have gathered trying to figure out this sort of stuff.</p>\n<p>Also, just focus on what you're good at. Don't think so much in terms of what you want to do. Think of what can you do, which is a weird thing to figure out because on the one hand, you have to compare yourself a little bit to other people. If you're \"good\" at something that tons and tons of people are good at, and there's not enough jobs in it, that's not as useful.</p>\n<p>Then you don't have to just be good, you have be one of the best. But if you're, say, one of the people who gets programming, there just aren't enough people who get programming. That's a career you can make a lot of money in.</p>\n<p>This applies to non-earning-to-give stuff as well. If you have a talent that non-profits really need, and there aren't enough people who can do this thing that non-profits need you to do, that's important too. The economic term is \"comparative advantage,\" so sort of what you are good at compared to other people.</p>\n<p>You also can't get too hung up on comparing yourselves to other people. When I was in high school, I was super good at math. I went to national-level math meets. But then I got to these meets and saw people who were even better than I was. Then I'm like, \"Oh, man!\" It's really discouraging.</p>\n<p>It was stupid for me to let myself get discouraged by that because even if I'm not going to be the next Einstein, now I still have a good job as a software developer. There are enough people here that I am sure there is someone who would benefit from me plugging software development because...</p>\n<p>[Audience laughs, I have a realization]</p>\n<p>We have a lot of people who are already software developers. The thing about software development is it's a lucrative career in a similar way that law and medicine are, but word hasn't gotten out about that yet.</p>\n<p>There's still a shortage people. It hasn't been like all the smart kids have flooded into it the way that it's happened with medicine and law. It's also something that's easy to switch into once you're already out of school. That's what I did. I had no idea this was even possible two years ago. Then I heard from people like Eliezer Yudkowsky who did a <a href=\"http://hpmor.com/notes/chapter-79/\">PSA about this</a> in HPMOR.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/lukemuehlhauser.com\">Luke</a>, in his capacity as my boss when I was a researcher for MIRI told me, \"Hey, you should really look at this.\" Finally after the third time I heard someone saying, \"You should really look at this,\" I finally did. Oh my gosh, I don't actually need a computer science degree to do this.</p>\n<p>If you're on the East Coast trying to get a job on Wall Street, they care a lot about where you got your degree, what your degree is in. Where did you go to school? Did you go to Harvard or Yale? Wait, no, sorry, bye. It's not quite that bad, but it's that kind of attitude.</p>\n<p>The tech scene in the Bay Area is a lot more open minded. If you can show you can do this stuff, we will give you a job. There are people who teach themselves to get a program and get a job. There are people like me, and Buck, and Edward who do this amazing thing called <a href=\"http://www.appacademy.io/?referer=Chris+Hallquist\">App Academy</a>, which is a nine week intensive course where they teach you to program and you don't have to pay the tuition until you actually get a job. They have a really good track record of placing people. People average like $100,000 salaries, no kidding.</p>\n<p>I wrote a <a href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/hallq/2014/06/so-youre-thinking-of-applying-to-app-academy/\">blog post</a> about App Academy.\u00a0<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2014/04/interview-with-buck-shlegeris-from-app-academy/\">Buck's interview</a>\u00a0is really good. Actually, hold on. Again, projector, I actually made a page on my personal website that's\u00a0<a href=\"http://ChrisHallquist.com/earning-to-give.html\">ChrisHallquist.com/earning-to-give.html</a>\u00a0which has all these links. It has a link to Buck's interview. It has a link to <a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/learn-code/\">Peter Herford's guide on learning to program</a>. It has a link to blog posts I've written. I decided this would be a virtual handout. If I gave you a piece of paper, you wouldn't be able to click on links.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Q__Regarding_App_Academy__what_if_you_re_not_a_US_citizen_\">Q. Regarding App Academy, what if you're not a US citizen?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, that's a problem. We do have some students who are non-US citizens.

How would you be thinking about the sort of replaceability concerns if you are accepting arguments about the far future?</strong></p>\n<p>That's a good point. It's sort of hard to answer, partly because I haven't investigated the funding situation of MIRI and FHI enough. Maybe Louie can tell you more about MIRI's funding situation and their ability to absorb more dollars. I don't know. That's something I intend to investigate in the near future, but I haven't investigated that enough. It's sort of a complicated question.</p>\n<p>Personally, from my point of view, if I were to investigate some of these, FHI, and MIRI, or whatever, and I just came to the conclusion that they didn't have a lot of room for more money, then I would just give to third world health organizations. You might believe that MIRI doesn't have room for more money, they might have room for more talent.</p>\n<p>There's a combination of what you think MIRI's funding situation is and what you think their room-for-more-talent situation is. It's complicated. You have to think about these things. I don't have the answers, but these are good considerations for you to have, is all I can say.</p>\n<p>Do we have anyone who is not just still a student, but is still a student on a traditional student track? You're going back to finish your degree, but you're making a ridiculous amount of money right now. Standard career advice for students doesn't apply.

As a person who is earning to give, do you plan to do anything other than being a hands-off money supplier?

I'm blogging right now, and I'm trying to write more blog posts that are related to effective altruism. I have to figure out what I can do. There are issues that I think are important, and yet I'm not sure what can be done about them.</p>\n<p>As for how to weigh the tradeoffs, it's hard to tell. The fact that I'm telling people I'm doing this and making sure that the specific information I have in my head that's not yet out there gets out there, and then I reach a point of diminishing returns on that and then it's worth putting more effort into my job.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Q__One_thing_I_was_wondering_about_when_I_was_doing_an_earning_to_give_strategy_is__has_it_ever_come_an_issue_at_work_that_you_re_publicly_doing_an_earning_to_give_strategy__Does_it_affect_your_negotiating_power_\">Q. One thing I was wondering about when I was doing an earning to give strategy is, has it ever come an issue at work that you're\u00a0publicly\u00a0doing an earning to give strategy? Does it affect your negotiating power?</strong></p>\n<p>It hasn't come up at all yet. I don't know if they've seen any of my blog posts or not. I've been blogging for years, and not just about effective altruism. When I was job searching, I'm like, \"Is this going to affect me\"? I asked Simon, the guy who helps people from App Academy get jobs. I asked him about this, especially because I was interviewing at Palantir.</p>\n<p>I'm like, \"Shit, is there something I said about Edward Snowden or something online...\" His response was, \"Yeah, they don't happen to give a shit. Nobody in the tech world gives a shit. If anything, they'll be impressed that you're bold and out there with your opinions.\"</p>\n<p>[Audience member comments: Jeff Kauffman has said that he has found that this increases his negotiating power because it's like, \"Oh, you want to save lives with it,\" rather than, \"Buy swimming pools\"?</p>\n<p>You can also often make favorable trades. Presumably, you're less risk averse with your money if you're donating it because there are fewer diminishing returns to your money. You can make favorable trades like sacrificing salary for equity that other people wouldn't be able to make.]</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Q__Do_you_pay_any_attention_to_the_direct_impact_of_your_work__or_do_you_ignore_that_entirely_and_just_aim_for_maximizing_income_\">Q.\u00a0Do you pay any attention to the direct impact of your work, or do you ignore that entirely and just aim for maximizing income?</strong></p>\n<p>On most things, the direct impact is going to be small positive or negative. Again, there's a replaceability issue there. There's a great post on 80K, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2013/07/show-me-the-harm/\">\"Show me the harm?\"</a>\u00a0It talked about people who say, \"Well, I wouldn't want to go to Goldman Sachs and make a lot of money and then donate it because Goldman Sachs is awful.\"</p>\n<p>They point out that Goldman Sachs has a lot of employees. Even if Goldman Sachs is truly directly responsible for wrecking the world economy, you're only responsible for a tiny percentage...\u00a0</p>\n<p>[Laughter]</p>\n<p>Also, the fact that if you didn't go do it, probably someone else would \u00a0which sounds much less nice, in this context versus the becoming-a-doctor context.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Q__You_were_just_talking_about_how_supply_constrained_the_computer_science_industry_is__It_s_quite_plausible_that_if_you_personally_did_not_decide_to_go_into_computer_science__it_would_be_close_to_one_less_computer_scientist_in_the_world_\">Q.

If they're following the, \"Here is out cutoff and we hire everyone above the cutoff,\" that's a good point. I didn't think of that.

Unrelated to the replaceability thing, in considering earning to give, do you think there is an amount of money that's the right amount or do you always want to be earning more money?\u00a0Do you think you should be exploring ways to be earning millions of dollars?</strong></p>\n<p>This is an interesting and slightly complicated issue. Earning more money is always better. You can save more lives. I'm happy with my current salary in so far as it's more than I ever expected to be making two years ago. There was a point in my job process where I thought I might have to accept a lower salary than what I'm making right now.</p>\n<p>In that sense, I'm happy with it. In terms of my long-term strategy, I'm thinking, \"Will I eventually want to move to Google where they pay better\"? Back to the job market again, South Bay companies tend to pay better than San Francisco companies. With San Francisco companies, often they're small startups that are more likely to give you equity.</p>\n<p>How the heck do you value this equity? I talked to Alexei when I was preparing for this talk. He said that he felt that for any given software engineer, your expected value for working at a startup is higher because of equity. The thing is, by taking equity, you're taking on risk. In a well-functioning market, that means you're, yeah.</p>\n<p>That's what I said to him, \"Yes, in a well-functioning market, but are you sure\"? He's like, \"I'm about 80 percent confident.\" He may be wrong.</p>\n<p>[Audience member: There's an equity risk premium, but there's also a startup trendiness premium.]</p>\n<p>Work for an untrendy startup is the answer.</p>\n<p>[Audience member: An evil, unpopular, ad startup.

Does valuing equity depend very strongly on your ability to predict whether the startup will succeed?</strong></cite></p>\n<p>That's a question. In theory, the risk premium means you don't know. The point is, you don't know if it will succeed. In exchange for the risk, there's a potential of a very high reward. If you start looking into a startup, you do want to be aware of warning signs like, \"Am I getting suckered on this equity offer or what\"?</p>\n<p>[Audience member: The market, the abstract concept, will have a certain amount of information that it's factoring in. If you have more information, then maybe you'll be able to make a better decision out of it. If you have less information, then maybe you stay aware of this and make decisions.]</p>\n<p>There's also the question of, would you be better off maybe just doing the obvious thing, working for Google and donating lots of money?

I would say why should startup equity be weighed it any differently than, say, investing in a VC fund? What I don't mean is why should you invest in a VC fund? I mean should you consider it as being more valuable than the amount that a VC is willing to pay for it?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes if you're less risk averse than the VC. The VC's are by definition taking risk, but they're probably still doing it for their own purposes. They probably have some recognition of having twice as expensive of a house is not. Yes, the VC's have to be risk tolerant by definition, but if you're looking at it from a perspective of donating to causes that have tons of room for more funding, you might want to be even less risk averse.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Q__Software_development_is_certainly_a_very_attractive_job_for_growth_purposes__but_are_there_any_others__Is_there_top_five__top_ten_\">Q. Software development is certainly a very attractive job for growth purposes, but are there any others? Is there top five, top ten?</strong></p>\n<p>The thing about software development is it's one of the few things I know that it's easy to switch into once you're already out of college. I wish I had known this stuff when I was high school. If I had known this stuff when I was in high school, I would have applied to Harvard and Yale and the big Ivies and then, from there, looked at...</p>\n<p>Yeah, apply to Harvard and Yale and the big Ivies, major in statistics. Consider programming jobs, but also consider a job at Goldman Sachs. But if you've already gotten your degree, it's much harder, I don't know if there's a way you could transition into finance.</p>\n<p>If you're still in high school, still in college, your options are way more open. In spite of the law and medicine, job markets aren't what they used to be, they're still lucrative careers. If you don't have the math background, but you're good at memorizing anatomy. Or if you've got the kind of social skills that you need as a lawyer, maybe those actually are good paths for you.</p>\n<p>I actually intended to investigate if it might be in my interest to switch tracks from software engineering into something else, but I think that would be very difficult. Software engineering is unusual in how easy it is to switch into later in life.</p></div></div>"},

Only 10% of our expenses go into planning, designing, and advertising them.\u201d Such a campaign strategy would seem patently bizarre; when buying a product few of us are interested in how much went into administration, all we care about is what we get for our money. Overhead ratio (the proportion of money going into administration) is irrelevant; only cost-effectiveness matters.</p>\n<p>This common sense approach to purchasing goods or services does not seem to translate into the non-profit sector, however. Consider the following advertisement by the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.care.org/about/financial-990\">organisation CARE</a>:\u00a0 \u201cMore than 90 percent of our expended resources \u2013 among the highest of all philanthropic organisations \u2013 support our poverty-fighting projects around the world. Less than 10 percent of expended resources go toward administrative and fundraising costs.\u201d</p>\n<p>CARE campaign strategy is quite common for a non-profit. Many charities attempt to win donors by emphasising their low overhead ratio. Perhaps they are right to so do, as\u00a0<a href=\"http://greymatterresearch.com/index_files/Grey_Matter_Report_Perceptions_of_Non-profit_Efficiency.pdf\">more than a third of US citizens</a> believe that charities should spend much less on administration. Further, lab studies have shown that <a href=\"http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/papers/charity.pdf\">people tend to donate more to charities with low overhead ratios</a>. Consequently, in order to fulfil donors\u2019 expectations\u00a0charities are forced to keep their overheads small\u00a0as illustrated in <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pallotta_the_way_we_think_about_charity_is_dead_wrong?language=en\">Dan Pallotta\u2019s TED talk</a>.</p>\n<p>Few donors are able to identify the irrelevance of overhead ratio to effective giving. The interventions of <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">some charities</a> are far more cost-effective than others, so that even if only a small percentage of donated money reaches the destination, the overall impact will be much more beneficial than a larger percentage of donations for a less effective intervention.</p>\n<p>Indeed, charity evaluators have not found any correlation between overhead ratio and cost-effectiveness: Organisations with a low overhead ratio can still fail to be effective, and organisations with a high overhead ratio can be very effective \u2013 maybe precisely due to\u00a0<a href=\"http://kresge.org/library/nonprofit-overhead-costs-breaking-vicious-cycle-misleading-reporting-unrealistic-expectation\">good administration</a>, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/108518074\">including competent staff, infrastructure, fundraising</a>, and evaluation.</p>\n<p>Given donor\u2019s proven aversion towards overhead, charities could consider offering \u2018overhead-free\u2019 donations (by, for example, soliciting unrestricted funding from a few large donors to cover administration costs). <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/632\">A recent study\u00a0published in Science</a>\u00a0has found that average donations can triple when donors are told that overhead costs are already covered. One explanation for this result is that people perceive their personal impact to be greater if all of their money reaches the destination.</p>\n<p>These findings raise an important question: Why are people so preoccupied with overhead ratio in the first place?\u00a0<a href=\"http://journal.sjdm.org/14/14402a/jdm14402a.pdf\">A study</a> we have recently conducted suggests that they may be falling prey to an error called evaluability bias; people focus on overhead ratio because it is easier to evaluate than cost-effectiveness.</p>\n<p>We found that when people are presented with information for a single charity (namely its overhead ratio and number of lives saved per dollar), on average charities with lower overhead ratios received more donations, irrespective of cost-effectiveness. However, when people are presented with information for two charities (allowing them to compare the cost-effectiveness of the two charities), they gave more to the charity with the greater cost-effectiveness, irrespective of overhead ratio. These findings suggest that people<em> do</em> care about saving lives, not administration costs, but that unless the information needed to evaluate cost-effectiveness is readily available, they will fall back on the easier-to-evaluate overhead ratio.</p>\n<p>So although people are biased about what matters in the non-profit sector, the good news is that appropriate information about cost-effectiveness can go a long way to correcting this bias. We must try to<a href=\"http://overheadmyth.com/\"> better inform</a> potential donors about the irrelevance of overhead ratio when selecting a charitable cause, and work to improve their\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)\">decisional architecture</a> to make it easier for them to realise the importance of cost-effectiveness.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/moral_imperative.pdf\">Shifting resources to the most cost-effective charities is crucial</a>; a lot of individuals\u2019 lives depend on it.</p></div></div>"},

However, cities with a high cost of living tend to have similarly high salaries (with exceptions). A job that pays $50k in Houston would pay <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/cost-of-living/\">$111k in Manhattan</a>, if the company gave cost of living adjustments. If all your money is going towards your living expenses then this wouldn't be important, but if you are donating a set percentage of your income (or paying off student debt, or saving for retirement), this doubles the amount you give (or pay off, or save). \u00a0Even if you\u2019re not donating a set percentage of your income, if your cost of living is less than most others in your job, then you will still end up ahead.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Be_Green_\">Be Green.</strong></p>\n<p>If global warming is something you care about, another factor is that big cities are significantly greener than elsewhere. Despite our ideas of big cities being pollution spewers, the high population density (a bunch of people live in a single apartment building, instead of a single family sprawled out in a large suburban home) and availability of public transportation make cities have significantly less greenhouse gas per capita. It seems like the cities with the highest cost of living do the best, which makes sense because there is a strong causal correlation between high rents, people living in small spaces, people living close together, there being good public transportation or walking availability, etc. In the US, New York and San Francisco do noticeably better than other cities.</p>\n<p><span> <span> </span><span>Greenhouse Gas Emissions Per Capita for select US cities </span>(source: <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTUWM/Resources/GHG_Index_Mar_9_2011.pdf\">World Bank</a>): </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0New York City: <span> <span> </span></span>7.9 \u00a0</li>\n<li><span> </span>San Francisco:<span> <span> </span></span>10.1 \u00a0</li>\n<li><span> </span>Seattle:<span> <span> </span></span>14.1 \u00a0&lt;-- known for \"green\" culture \u00a0</li>\n<li>\u00a0Menlo Park: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span> </span>16.4 \u00a0</li>\n<li><span> </span>US Overall Average:<span> <span> </span></span>23.6 \u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Build_a_Movement_\">Build a Movement.</strong></p>\n<p>If building the effective altruism movement is something you care about, then you will probably also have a better opportunity to do that in a larger city, even if that requires paying higher costs of living. For instance, the two largest cities for effective altruism, San Francisco and Oxford both have high costs of living but effective altruists there can reap some social and other benefits.</p>\n<p>So if you can work remotely or your salary is fixed, it\u2019s probably good to be where living costs are low but for most effective altruists, it seems like the opposite might be the case.</p>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><strong>My questions are this:\u00a0</strong></div>\n<p>1. Do most jobs actually account for cost of living in their salary offers, so that we can offer this as generalized advice (though of course there may be exceptions)?</p>\n<p>2. Are the cost of living salary adjustments not as big as the actual cost of living differences? So that the job might pay slightly more in a big city, but not a full adjustment more?</p>\n<p>3.

Encouraging people to give to the most effective charities, however, involves appealing to their reason. Do these facts necessarily clash? Does the effective altruism movement face an uphill struggle against people\u2019s intuitions, gut feelings and personal experiences?</p>\n<p>Our findings investigate the ways in which giving with your head can appeal to the heart. A number of simple, intuitive, persuasion techniques can dramatically alter an individual\u2019s ability to understand, and really internalise, their potential to do good.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Crunching_Numbers\">Crunching Numbers</strong></p>\n<p>\u2018Giving ten per cent of your income\u2019 is a scary thought, until you actually think about it. So, when persuading someone to take the Giving What We Can pledge, giving someone the space to think it over can be a surprisingly useful tool. A 2011 paper by economist Anna Breman showed that when regular donors were encouraged to increase their donations, the mean increase in monthly donations was 32% higher among people asked to do so after two months, than those who were asked to do so immediately. In a second experiment this figure stood at 11% So, when inviting someone to take the pledge, consider asking for a commitment first, and allowing them space to adjust to the idea before actually starting payments.</p>\n<p>Another way of framing the ten per cent donation in a more appealing way is through suggesting that the donations be made frequently, and in smaller amounts. A study by Strahilevitz in 2010 showed that \u2018the relative appeal of giving to charity rather than having those resources for oneself is greater for small amounts than for large amounts.\u2019 Have you ever been reminded of how much you could give to charity if you simply cut down on the latt\u00e9s? This is the \u2018little-but-often\u2019 model at work: when people see a donation as a series of small sacrifices, they are much more likely to appreciate its overall good.</p>\n<p>This brings us on to a fundamental problem with fundraising for effective altruism: people struggle with conceptualising large numbers. When Kurt Tucholsky (not Stalin, who was hardly an insightful man) said that one death is a tragedy, and thousands is a statistic, he was alluding to a truth that social psychologists have recently come to elucidate. Take a recent series of studies by V\u00e4stfj\u00e4ll et al. (2014) which found that as more children were introduced in different charity appeals, activity in the Zygomaticus Major muscles decreased. Activity in these muscles is typically associated with compassion and the anticipated \u2018warm glow\u2019 of giving. As more victims of poverty were introduced, then, people\u2019s empathy towards them decreased. V\u00e4stfj\u00e4ll, understandably annoyed, organised a second study in which these children were grouped into \u2018entities,\u2019 such as families. He found that eight related children elicited more empathy, and donations, than eight unrelated children. So, when talking about the lives that one can save through effective giving, stress that these are not simply abstract third-worlders, who exist as nothing more than statistics, but real people who relate to one another.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_It_s_not_that_I_dislike_people_but_I_m_a_great_animal_lover__\">\u2018It\u2019s not that I dislike people but I\u2019m a great animal lover\u2026\u2019</strong></p>\n<p>There are, however, some heavily ingrained biases in people\u2019s altruistic behaviour which can take real effort to break. Today\u2019s society is saturated with different charitable appeals, and interview data suggests that donors use a variety of heuristic, experience-based rules of thumb to cope with the complexity. A study in 2014 pulled up such responses as, \u2018I very rarely look at a new charity,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not adding to my list,\u2019 or \u2018I have a box\u2026all the [charity leaflets] go in and every month I donate to two of them.\u2019 In persuading someone to give effectively, we have a responsibility to help people see through the complexity of charity and explain clearly and concisely why organisations like the Against Malaria Foundation deserve our support.</p>\n<p>Arguably more damaging is the idea that there is a limit to how much good one can really be expected to do. Having done one\u2019s \u2018good deed for the day,\u2019 people can get defensive, even offended, about being asked to do more. It falls to us, then, to remind people of their potential to save lives, resisting the temptation to rest on one\u2019s laurels and focus on future aims rather than past virtues. Indeed, one study has shown that people primed to think of themselves as virtuous behave less altruistically than those primed to think of themselves in a negative light. Without going so far as to advocate a wholesale campaign against people\u2019s self-esteem, it can be useful to shift the emphasis of a discussion away from someone\u2019s previous acts of generosity and towards what should be done in the future.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Persuasion_Techniques\">Persuasion Techniques</strong></p>\n<p>More generally, there are a number of things to keep in mind, whatever the nature of your appeal, for encouraging people to give more. We have already gone over a number of barriers towards attitude change that many perfectly well-intentioned people can experience. In persuasion, it is always better, and indeed, more sympathetic, to yield to some of these truisms rather than attack them outright. Cialdini, Green and Rusch found that students interviewed about exam reform at their university were more receptive, even to specious arguments, when the interviewer yielded to some of the subjects\u2019 arguments rather than resisting them.</p>\n<p>Suppose, however, that you are in a position of responsibility for delivering a presentation on altruism to a large group of people. A different, very easily applicable technique is not to immediately tell the prospective donors what your aim is. Begin with a brief discussion centring on the precise goals that Giving What We Can and other effective altruism movements seek to tackle. Go into some detail about the nature of different interventions and encourage people to think in a logical way by guiding them through how poverty alleviation works in practice. One study showed that people prepared to engage their minds by memorising long sequences of letters were much more likely to donate to a charitable appeal which focussed on the plight of multiple children as opposed to just one, than those asked to memorise just two letters.</p>\n<p>Equally, what best helps people to put their ideas into actions is giving them clear instructions. In a study by Levanthal, Singer and Jones, students were given leaflets to get Tetanus shots. The students who received leaflets with directions to the medical centre were much more likely to get the shots despite the fact that they were already familiar with where the medical centre was.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>We have outlined a number of problems, and, hopefully, a number of solutions, to the question of how to encourage people to break their implicit assumptions about charity, and to give with their heads as much as their hearts. The mental blocks that keep people from giving effectively are often long-ingrained beliefs that, while firm, can be brittle. If you can really get someone to engage their brains by discussing charity in an intelligent way, you may be surprised how quickly attitudes change.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an unfortunate quirk of the human mind that it struggles to conceive of large numbers in a meaningful way, and this is an obstacle that Giving What We Can must overcome in order to press home points about effective giving. The scale of what we can accomplish can, both for better and for worse, be unimaginable.</p></div></div>"},

There's potential to come off as \"I'm more moral than you\", potential for \"I think the charities you do support are useless\", for \"I'm so rich I can afford to give away lots of money\", \"I'm trying to convert you\", \"I think you're a bad person because you don't do this\", and for just seeming weird.  Most of the year I just don't bring it up, but as we get into giving season I feel like I ought to try.</p>\n<p>I think most of the social difficulty around effective altruism comes from the demandingness aspect, the idea that to be a good person you should be devoting a substantial effort to making the world better. One way around this is to mostly focus on the effectiveness angle, saying \"here's an awesome charity that can do huge amounts of good with your donation\".  The best charities are <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/the-unintuitive-power-laws-of-giving\">so much</a> <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/charity-variance-vision\">better</a> than the rest that pushing effectiveness seems well worth it, and any sort of discussion of giving helps normalize it and lead people to give more.  So here are three ideas for promoting effective giving among your coworkers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Matching Donations</strong>. Offer to match donations to one of GiveWell's picks.  This provides openings to talk about effective altruism, why evaluation matters, and the good this charity can do. Lots of people are more willing to give if they see the people around them are giving too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Donation Drives</strong>.  Many workplaces traditionally have donation drives around the holidays.  If your work has one, consider getting involved and helping out.  This can then let you push some for effectiveness as a consideration in choosing what charity to raise money for.  If you don't have one yet, or the one you have is tightly coupled to an existing charity, like collecting cans for a foodbank, then consider starting a new one.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Updated Recommendations Discussion</strong>.  GiveWell will be putting out their updated recommendations by <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/10/25/reminder-annual-rankings-refresh-2/\">December 1st</a>, and judging from their <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/\">recent blog posts</a> there are likely to be several new top charities, each presenting different benefits and tradeoffs.  Hosting a discussion to talk about these new options when they come out is a great opportunity to get into ideas about how to choose a charity and what matters.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hosted a recommendations discussion last year and this year I'm doing that again plus getting together with some other EAs here to match donations.  I haven't tried organizing a donation drive but it seems promising.</p></div></div>"},

There are a limited number of books and scientific papers on the topic and the core questions are generally not regarded as resolved, but the people who seem most informed about the issue generally believe that space colonization will eventually be possible. I found no books or scientific papers arguing for in-principle infeasibility, and believe I would have found important ones if they existed. The blog posts and journalistic pieces arguing for the infeasibility of space colonization are largely unconvincing due to lack of depth and failure to engage with relevant counterarguments.<p></p><p>The potential obstacles to space colonization include: very large energy requirements, health and reproductive challenges from microgravity and cosmic radiation, short human lifespans in comparison with great distances for interstellar travel, maintaining a minimal level of genetic diversity, finding a hospitable target, substantial scale requirements for building another civilization, economic challenges due to large costs and delayed returns, and potential political resistance. Each of these obstacles has various proposed solutions and/or arguments that the problem is not insurmountable. Many of these obstacles would be easier to overcome given potential advances in AI, robotics, manufacturing, and propulsion technology.</p><p>Deeper investigation of this topic could address the feasibility of the relevant advances in AI, robotics, manufacturing, and propulsion technology. My intuition is that such investigation would lend further support to the conclusion that interstellar colonization will eventually be possible.</p><p>Note: This investigation relied significantly on interviews and Wikipedia articles because I\u2019m unfamiliar with the area, there are not many very authoritative sources, and I was trying to review this question quickly.\n</p><h2 id=\"Why_did_I_look_into_this_question_\">Why did I look into this question?</h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li>If people are likely to eventually colonize space, then it increases the potential scale and duration of civilization. This could affect arguments about the importance of trying to affect the long-run future of civilization. For example, Nick Bostrom<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup> and I<sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup> have appealed to the possibility of interstellar space colonization in our arguments for the importance of reducing existential risk or otherwise affecting distant future generations.</li>\n\t<li>In correspondence, some people have tried to resist arguments for the extreme importance of the distant future by rejecting the claim that there is a reasonable chance of colonizing space in the future. I don\u2019t believe these arguments essentially depend on the feasibility of space colonization. However, I believed that the evidence for the feasibility of space colonization was strong enough to carry that argument, and I wanted to test that assumption.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Clarifying_the_question\">Clarifying the question</h2>\nWill we eventually be able to colonize other stars? I focused on a version of this question assuming unlimited time horizons and \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d (no major catastrophes or unexpected reversals of global trends), with the aim of establishing settlements which could function independently of Earth-based civilization. My version of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d could be disputed, especially by people who believe ecological constraints may spell an end to innovation and economic development in the coming century or two, leaving insufficient time for the technological developments necessary to make a project of this kind feasible. Apart from noting the potential problem, that is a discussion best left for another investigation.\n<h2 id=\"Range_of_current_opinion_on_this_topic\">Range of current opinion on this topic</h2>\nA recent, lengthy report by the National Research Council discussing rationales and approaches stated that it currently isn\u2019t known whether we\u2019ll eventually be able to create self-sufficient off-Earth settlements,<sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup> but only two of 285 pages were devoted to this issue. People who have done the most in-depth work on the feasibility of space colonization generally believe it is possible. For instance, I found several books and academic papers published on this topic, and they are all written by people who think it is possible,<sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup> but I found no books or academic papers arguing for that interstellar colonization is impossible. I discuss whether this is due to a selection effect below. I found some journalistic pieces and magazine articles arguing for the impossibility of space colonization because of worries about microgravity<sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup> or getting enough energy,<sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup> but I generally found them very unconvincing due to lack of depth and failure to discuss obvious counterarguments. For example, the articles arguing from challenges of microgravity to the impossibility of space colonization failed to consider the most obvious solution: rotating the spaceship to induce artificial gravity. For the most part, the articles arguing from energy/propulsion challenges didn\u2019t discuss any specific problems with existing proposals to get enough energy using alternatives to the current chemical rockets we have today, such as nuclear fission, fusion, beam propulsion, solar sails, or antimatter (more on this below). An exception was a brief essay written for an Edge.org competition by Ed Regis, which did quickly discuss some of these potential propulsion methods<sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup> (in addition to several of the other challenges I discuss below). However, Regis makes the strange choice of highlighting the most speculative and unlikely propulsion methods, and does not address fission or fusion. It\u2019s possible that the scientists quoted have more developed arguments that the journalists have failed to communicate, which would suggest that better critiques along these lines are possible, but it isn\u2019t clear to me how these critiques would be developed based on what has been said.<p></p><p>Of the four people I interviewed on this topic, only one (Charles Stross) was pessimistic about our prospects for colonizing the stars. I sought out Charles Stross specifically because he had been referenced by other sources as a notable critic of the feasibility of space colonization<sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup> and because his essay on the topic had the best pessimistic arguments I had seen. From my perspective, his most compelling concerns were about motivation to try in light of large expenses and scale-related challenges for getting a civilization off the ground (more on these below). However, even Stross believes that, if we develop advanced AI/robotics, we are likely to colonize the stars. I asked the four people I interviewed for more references from people who believe we can\u2019t colonize the stars, and their comments<sup><sup>[9]</sup></sup> suggest I am not missing any major critiques of the feasibility of interstellar colonization. Comments from these interviews also suggested to me that people publishing work on this topic generally believe interstellar colonization is feasible.<sup><sup>[10]</sup></sup></p><p>Perhaps only people who think space colonization is likely to be feasible get excited enough to write books and careful scientific articles on the subject. But, for a few reasons listed below, it seems this could only partly explain the distribution of informed opinion on the feasibility of space colonization.\u00a0 First, according to Geoffrey Landis, informed experts in nearby fields, such as researchers at NASA, generally haven\u2019t thought very much about whether interstellar colonization is possible,<sup><sup>[11]</sup></sup>and don\u2019t have opinions one way or the other. If there were good arguments for the infeasibility of space colonization that just weren\u2019t being considered by the people I spoke with, I would expect that this would be the group that was aware of them. Second, I have cited a reasonable number of journalistic articles and blog posts arguing for the infeasibility of space colonization, and these articles are surprisingly bad if you think some informed people have convincing arguments for skepticism about the feasibility of space colonization. Third, some claims about interstellar colonization--e.g. by Hawking--have received significant interest from journalists and the public, and if skeptics had other convincing arguments that we probably wouldn\u2019t ever be able to colonize the stars, I would expect someone to make these arguments more generally known.\n</p><h2 id=\"What_are_the_potential_obstacles_to_interstellar_colonization_\">What are the potential obstacles to interstellar colonization?</h2>\nBig picture, interstellar colonization requires success at each of the following steps (though not necessarily on the first attempt):\n<ol>\n\t<li>Attempt to colonize space</li>\n\t<li>Get everything you need to build a civilization into a spaceship</li>\n\t<li>Get the spaceship going fast in the right direction</li>\n\t<li>Have enough of what you need to build a civilization survive/remain intact during the voyage</li>\n\t<li>Slow the spaceship down when you\u2019re getting close enough to your target location</li>\n\t<li>Build a civilization at your target location</li>\n</ol>\nThis review will discuss these steps out of order because it will help with clarifying what we need to bring on a trip of this kind and what kind of motivation would be needed in order to make the attempt.\n<h3 id=\"Speeding_up_and_slowing_down\">Speeding up and slowing down</h3>\nProxima Centuari\u2014the closest star outside our solar system\u2014is 4.2 light years away.<sup><sup>[12]</sup></sup> Currently, Voyager 1 is moving away from the sun at 17 km/s, faster than any other human-made object.<sup><sup>[13]</sup></sup> At its current speed, it would take over 70,000 years to reach travel that distance (though it isn\u2019t going in that direction).<sup><sup>[14]</sup></sup> The voyage would take decades even at a significant fraction of the speed of light. The longer the trip, the harder it is to ensure that all critical parts of the system (including passengers or descendants of passengers) survive the journey. These issues are discussed in the next sections. This section will focus on propulsion methods and energy requirements.<p></p><p>Charles Stross estimated that it would take at least 10<sup>18</sup> Joules of energy to accelerate a 2000 kg spacecraft to 10% of the speed of light, and an equal amount to slow it down\u2014making generous assumptions such as 100% efficient energy conversion and no reaction mass. This was equivalent to five days of human civilization\u2019s total electrical energy production in 2007,<sup><sup>[15]</sup></sup> or about one day of civilization\u2019s whole energy production.<sup><sup>[16]</sup></sup> However, there has been a long history of exponential growth in energy production and economic productivity.<sup><sup>[17]</sup></sup> If these trends continue long enough, interstellar colonization will become much more affordable.<sup><sup>[18]</sup></sup></p><p>It might be objected that there are some physical reasons to be skeptical that this kind of exponential growth in energy output will continue for long enough to carry this argument. For example, Tom Murphy has argued\u2014based on thermodynamic principles\u2014that hundreds of years of increases in energy production at this exponential rate would have absurd consequences, such as increasing the Earth\u2019s surface temperature to boiling temperature.<sup><sup>[19]</sup></sup><sup>\u00a0 </sup>However, Murphy's calculations suggest that it would be possible to have 100 times as much energy output on Earth as we currently do without substantially affecting Earth's temperature,<sup><sup>[20]</sup></sup> which would make the energy cost of an interstellar mission not unreasonable on assumptions like Stross\u2019s. More importantly though, an interstellar mission could be launched from interplanetary space, substantially weakening the original line of argument.</p><p>Some proposed propulsion technologies\u2014such as nuclear fission, fusion, anti-matter, beam propulsion, and solar sails\u2014might address these challenges. I encountered disagreement about whether these proposed technologies were known to be feasible or not. Robert Zubrin claimed in our interview that there were specific technologies which were known to be physically possible, and could allow us to travel at a few percent of the speed of light.<sup><sup>[21]</sup></sup> Ed Regis said we didn\u2019t know whether some of these technologies were feasible,<sup><sup>[22]</sup></sup> but he didn\u2019t discuss fission, fusion, beam propulsion, or solar sails, which seem much less speculative than the technologies whose feasibility he questioned. I have not looked at these proposals closely, but the Orion project, which was led by Freeman Dyson, received substantial funding and attention from serious people.<sup><sup>[23]</sup></sup> My intuition is that nuclear propulsion is the least speculative, and would be sufficient for bringing a spacecraft to a significant fraction of the speed of light.\n</p><h3 id=\"Surviving_the_journey__challenges_for_human_passengers\">Surviving the journey: challenges for human passengers</h3>\n<h4 id=\"Microgravity\">Microgravity</h4>\nThe human body is adapted to the level of gravitational force normally experienced on the surface of the Earth, and extended exposure to a zero-g environment has various adverse health effects, including loss of bone and muscle mass, retinal damage, redistribution of bodily fluids toward the upper half of the body, balance disorders, and loss of taste and smell.<sup><sup>[24]</sup></sup> According to Wikipedia, we have very limited knowledge about the potential effects on the very young and the elderly.<sup><sup>[25]</sup></sup> In addition, attempts to breed mice and fish eggs in space have come out badly, and the prevailing view is that microgravity is the source of the problem.<sup><sup>[26]</sup></sup> This may be a problem because\u2014given the distance to other stars\u2014human reproduction may be necessary in transit.<p></p><p>A simple solution to this problem is to induce artificial gravity by rotating the vessel/habitat,<sup><sup>[27]</sup></sup> though some other solutions have been proposed as well.<sup><sup>[28]</sup></sup>\n</p><h4 id=\"Cosmic_radiation\">Cosmic radiation</h4>\nExtended exposure to cosmic radiation damages DNA, and might cause cancer or other negative health effects. Earth\u2019s atmosphere and/or magnetic field prevent these problems near Earth\u2019s surface. Cosmic radiation could also damage electronic equipment.<sup><sup>[29]</sup></sup><p></p><p>Some proposed solutions to this problem include mass shielding and magnetic shielding. Mass shielding would definitely work, but increases the energy requirements for travel.<sup><sup>[30]</sup></sup> It is less certain that magnetic shielding would work and magnetic shielding would require less mass,<sup><sup>[31]</sup></sup> but it may create other health risks.<sup><sup>[32]</sup></sup></p><p>Zubrin suggested that cosmic radiation was not a significant concern for interstellar travel. In support of this, he argued that we\u2019ve had people working close to nuclear reactors on nuclear submarines for over 50 years without major problems.<sup><sup>[33]</sup></sup> There is some additional background on this obstacle on Wikipedia, \u201cHealth threat from cosmic rays.\u201d\n</p><h4 id=\"Human_lifespan\">Human lifespan</h4>\nInterstellar voyages would take decades even at a significant fraction of the speed of light, and centuries or even millennia at more modest speeds. Therefore, it may be impossible to complete the trip within a human lifetime.<p></p><p>Proposed solutions to this problem include \u201cgeneration ships\u201d designed to rear children and train them to continue the voyage mid-flight, extending the human lifespan, suspended animation/re-animation upon arrival.<sup><sup>[34]</sup></sup>\n</p><h3 id=\"Surviving_the_journey__general_physical_challenges\">Surviving the journey: general physical challenges</h3>\n<h4 id=\"Interstellar_medium\">Interstellar medium</h4>\nFrom notes from a conversation with Charles Stross:<p></p><p>When travelling at a few percent of the speed of light, collisions with interstellar matter could cause significant damage to a vessel. Like radiation, this is something that might be overcome with appropriate shielding, though there are trade-offs between mass from shielding and the amount of energy necessary for propulsion.</p><p>The other people I spoke with about this issue also believed that this challenge could be overcome with appropriate shielding.<sup><sup>[35]</sup></sup> However, in his brief critique of the feasibility of interstellar missions, Ed Regis claimed that \u201ca high-speed collision with something as small as a grain of salt would be like encountering an H-bomb,\u201d suggesting he did not find it clear that this challenge could be overcome.<sup><sup>[36]</sup></sup>Some simple calculations, however, suggest that Regis's claim could only be realistic under very extreme assumptions. Assuming that 100% of the kinetic energy of the salt grain were converted to an explosion, a one-milligram mass could only produce a one-megaton explosion if the spacecraft were travelling at extremely close to light speed. At 10% of light speed the impact would be equivalent to about 100 kg of TNT, which is about 10 million times smaller. At 1% of light speed, the impact would be equivalent to about 1 kg of TNT.<sup><sup>[37]</sup></sup> These smaller explosions would not be negligible, but would probably be within the range of explosions that some bunkers and armored vehicles are capable of withstanding today.</p><p>In the paper I saw which investigated this issue most deeply, the authors recommended that, to be conservative, interstellar missions conducted at \u2265 0.1c prepare for the possibility of hitting dust particles of 0.01 mg. These collisions would carry only 1% of the kinetic energy discussed in the paragraph above.<sup><sup>[38]</sup></sup>\n</p><h4 id=\"Mechanical_integrity_over_a_long_voyage\">Mechanical integrity over a long voyage</h4>\nFrom notes from a conversation with Geoffrey Landis:<p></p><p>Interstellar colonization may require making machines that will work for hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of years. Few machines can do this now, but perhaps appropriate repair systems would solve the problem. This is something that has not been done, and it\u2019s not clear that it could be done.</p><p>This concern was echoed by Anders Sandberg, though, in his estimation, this is a solvable engineering problem.<sup><sup>[39]</sup></sup>As with collisions with interstellar matter, this problem could potentially be addressed through trial and error if multiple colonization or exploration attempts are made.</p><p>Voyager 1, mentioned above, was launched on September 5, 1977, has had no critical mechanical failures for over 36 years, and is expected to continue to function until 2025.<sup><sup>[40]</sup></sup> Therefore, designing a spacecraft which would operate without a critical mechanical error for decades would not be wholly unprecedented.\n</p><h3 id=\"Building_a_civilization_on_the_other_end\">Building a civilization on the other end</h3>\n<h4 id=\"Genetic_diversity\">Genetic diversity</h4>\nA small population establishing a space colony would risk genetic damage due to inbreeding. This challenge might be addressed by bringing tens or hundreds of people (at increased energy costs) or bringing a few people plus enough embryos/gametes.<sup><sup>[41]</sup></sup>\n<h4 id=\"Hospitable_location\">Hospitable location</h4>\nAccording to Wikipedia, \u201cThere are 59 known stellar systems within 20 light years from the Sun, containing 81 visible stars,\u201d with some of the most appealing targets for interstellar travel in that range.<sup><sup>[42]</sup></sup><p></p><p>Stross argued that for most places on Earth throughout most of Earth\u2019s history, the planet wouldn\u2019t be very hospitable to humans, and this raises questions about how hard it would be to find a hospitable planet.<sup><sup>[43]</sup></sup></p><p>Potential solutions to this challenge include terraforming, searching through many planets, living off planets, and doing colonization with advanced AI, robotics, and manufacturing. Conceivably, advances in AI, robotics, and manufacturing would allow a civilization to thrive in space, eliminating the need for finding habitable planets.\n</p><h4 id=\"Infrastructure_and_scale_requirements\">Infrastructure and scale requirements</h4>\nFrom a conversation with Charles Stross:<p></p><p>If the goal of space colonization is to create another civilization that is viable independently of the continued success of Earth-based civilization, there will be enormous challenges putting in place the large infrastructure necessary for an industrial civilization. Our current industrial civilization\u2014including systems for manufacturing, science, education, entertainment, support systems for people who aren\u2019t working, etc.\u2014probably requires at least a billion people. It is extremely hard to see how to create a space colony capable of replacing our current industrial civilization without at least hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>This objection has received relatively little attention from people optimistic about space colonization. An exception to this is the science fiction novel <em>Learning the World</em> by Ken MacLeod, which focuses on a \u201cgeneration ship\u201d which has been travelling for thousands of years.</p><p>Possible solutions to this problem include bringing a large number of people, bringing a few people with a plan to build up a large infrastructure, and creating self-replicating robots that would be capable of building a civilization.<sup><sup>[44]</sup></sup></p><p>I did not see much detailed discussion of how this could be done,<sup><sup>[45]</sup></sup> but my intuition is that with advances in AI/robotics that would create machines capable of doing essentially all the tasks humans do, it should be possible for machines to build a civilization, even in a highly hostile environment. Stross expressed a similar view, though he had more uncertainty about whether such advances would ever be made.<sup><sup>[46]</sup></sup> This is an area where someone with different background assumptions would be especially likely to disagree with me, and I\u2019d have to do substantially more work to convince them of my position.\n</p><h3 id=\"Unknown_obstacles\">Unknown obstacles</h3>\nTwo people I spoke with, Sandberg<sup><sup>[47]</sup></sup> and Zubrin,<sup><sup>[48]</sup></sup> thought that the impossibility of space colonization would require the discovery of new physics. Landis thought it was possible that there were unknown obstacles that could make space colonization impossible, and pointed to Fermi\u2019s Paradox as a reason that one might expect this.<sup><sup>[49]</sup></sup> Some possible explanations of Fermi\u2019s Paradox would point to other reasons that space colonization is impossible, but others would not. For example, crucial technologies could fail for some reason we can\u2019t appreciate, we might be living in a computer simulation without real stars outside our solar system, or some aliens could be preventing interstellar colonization. On the other hand, some step we\u2019ve already passed (e.g. the creation of the first life, multicellular organisms, intelligent life, industrialization) may happen only extremely rarely.<sup><sup>[50]</sup></sup>\n<h3 id=\"Will_to_do_it\">Will to do it</h3>\nPeople I spoke with disagreed about whether people would ever attempt interstellar colonization. Stross argued that interstellar colonization could only have a very uncertain and very long-term economic payoff, which would make it very hard to finance by appeal to economic motives.<sup><sup>[51]</sup></sup> However, Carl Shulman has forthcoming blog post in which he argues that there will probably eventually be strong economic incentives for interstellar colonization.<p></p><p>Other potential motives for colonizing space include curiosity and adventure, increasing civilization\u2019s ability to survive global catastrophes,<sup><sup>[52]</sup></sup> or increasing the size of civilization. More generally, in a world with great diversity of motivations, it may not be too hard to find someone who wants to try to colonize space.<sup><sup>[53]</sup></sup> Historically speaking, Gerard O\u2019Neill\u2019s L5 Society\u2014which had the aim of colonizing (interplanetary) space\u2014had over 10,000 members when it merged with the National Space Institute.<sup><sup>[54]</sup></sup></p><p>On the opposing side, something that could gather the energy necessary for interstellar travel might be weaponized, and this could\u2014imaginably\u2014create political opposition to interstellar travel.<sup><sup>[55]</sup></sup> Some further relevant notes from my conversation with Stross:</p><p>\u201cHowever, other ideological perspectives\u2014such as perspectives emphasizing the sacredness of nature\u2014might oppose space colonization. Opposition from these perspectives could prevent an optimistic minority from colonizing space even if it were feasible.\u201d\n</p><h2 id=\"Implications_of_advanced_AI__robotics__and_manufacturing_for_the_feasibility_of_interstellar_colonization\">Implications of advanced AI, robotics, and manufacturing for the feasibility of interstellar colonization</h2>\nAdvances in AI, robotics, or manufacturing could reduce many of the challenges of space colonization noted above.<sup><sup>[56]</sup></sup> Spelling this out a bit more, microgravity, cosmic radiation, human lifespan, genetic diversity, and habitability are either unproblematic or much less problematic with robots instead of humans. They could also reduce the amount of mass required for the mission, and therefore reduce the energy requirements. However, the use of advanced AI/robotics was rarely discussed in the materials I read, and was not emphasized by the people I interviewed, with the exception of Anders Sandberg.\n<h2 id=\"Conclusions_and_questions_for_further_investigation\">Conclusions and questions for further investigation</h2>\nMy impression is that the most informed people thinking about these issues believe that space colonization will eventually be possible, and that they believe this for reasons that make sense to me. In my view, the most uncertain step is the part where we build a civilization upon arriving at another star system. However, my intuition\u2014as stated above\u2014is that advances in AI and robotics will make it possible for machines to substitute for humans in building a civilization, even in environments that would be very inhospitable to humans.<p></p><p>Further investigation into this topic might focus on the following questions:\n</p><ol>\n\t<li>Does this list contain all significant known obstacles to interstellar colonization?</li>\n\t<li>How likely is it that there are unknown obstacles that might make interstellar colonization impossible?</li>\n\t<li>Given sufficiently advanced AI, robotics, and molecular manufacturing, is interstellar colonization definitely feasible?</li>\n\t<li>Given business as usual, is it likely that these advances in AI, robotics, and molecular manufacturing will eventually be made?</li>\n\t<li>Do we know, as Zubrin claimed, that some physically possible propulsion technologies could get us to several percent of the speed of light? If so, which are they and how do we know this?</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"My_process\">My process</h2>\nThis research draws on interviews with Anders Sandberg, Geoffrey Landis, Robert Zubrin, and Charles Stross. Charles Stross was the most credible skeptic of the feasibility of space colonization that I could find. He was cited as a critic of <em>The High Frontier</em> on the book\u2019s Wikipedia page and multiple people I spoke with referred me to Stross as a skeptic that was worth speaking to.<p></p><p>A list of many, but not all, of the sources I considered, how I found them, and how closely I looked into them is available <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsP94pg6WYCIdGk2alNnTWEzOUNsazYtOU51SWdfZUE&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0\">here</a>. I began by looking for articles arguing for or against the feasibility of space colonization, searching Google, Google Scholar, and Amazon.com with terms like \u201cspace colonization,\u201d \u201cspace settlement,\u201d \u201cpossible,\u201d \u201cimpossible,\u201d \u201cfeasible,\u201d and \u201cinfeasible,\u201d and then followed up on articles referenced in the most relevant sources I found. None of the people I interviewed were aware of notable articles arguing for the impossibility of space colonization that I had missed, though I asked all of them specifically about this. I spent 36 hours on this project.</p><p>I am grateful to Robin Hanson, Pablo Stafforini, Carl Shulman, Anders Sandberg, and Toby Ord for feedback on a draft of this review.\n</p><h2 id=\"Sources\">Sources</h2>\nArmstrong, Stuart and Anders Sandberg. 2013. \u201cEternity in six hours: Intergalactic spreading of intelligent life and sharpening the Fermi paradox.\u201d <em>Acta Astronautica </em>89 (2013): 1-13.

A typical estimate of the human brain\u2019s processing power is roughly 10^17 operations per second or less. Not much more seems to be needed to simulate the relevant parts of the environment in sufficient detail to enable the simulated minds to have experiences indistinguishable from typical current human experiences.

Some of them will probably have planets that are hospitable to life, perhaps many of these planets could be made hospitable with appropriate technological developments. Some of these are near stars that will burn for much longer than our sun, some for as much as 100 trillion years (Adams, 2008, p. 39). If multiple locations were colonized, the risk of total destruction would dramatically decrease, since it would take independent global disasters, or a cosmological catastrophe, to destroy civilization.

Indeed, we have diminished the ability of infrared radiation to escape, leading to global warming. Even so, we are still in balance to within less than the 1% level.

Over time these deconditioning effects can impair astronauts\u2019 performance, increase their risk of injury, reduce their aerobic capacity, and slow down their cardiovascular system. As the human body consists mostly of fluids, gravity tends to force them into the lower half of the body, and our bodies have many systems to balance this situation. When released from the pull of gravity, these systems continue to work, causing a general redistribution of fluids into the upper half of the body.

If objects are travelling at a high speed, hitting a very small piece of dust could do substantial damage. Travelling at a high speed is desirable for interstellar or intergalactic travel. The larger the vessel, the worse the problem. Intergalactic dust is less common, and would be much less of a problem.</p><p>This problem could be averted by creating adequate shielding. At a conservative end, we know that space dust does not prevent comet nuclei from doing interstellar travel at a few tens of km/s. A vessel could simply dig into a comet and use it as shielding (for a very slow trip). Anders believes that other shields could be constructed out of metal and graphene foils which would make interstellar and intergalactic space colonization possible with at higher speeds and with less mass.\u201d Notes from a conversation with Anders Sandberg.</p><p>\u201cI mentioned a couple of the potential obstacles to interstellar colonization that came up in my interview with Anders Sandberg: space dust (which might damage vessels moving close to the speed of light) and radiation. Dr. Zubrin didn\u2019t think space dust was a serious concern, and argued that damage from radiation could clearly be prevented with adequate shielding.\u201d Notes from a conversation with Robert Zubrin.</p><p><sup><sup>[36]</sup></sup> \u201cEven if by some miracle suitable propulsion systems became available, a starship traveling at relativistic speeds would have to be equipped with sophisticated collision detection and avoidance systems, given that a high-speed collision with something as small as a grain of salt would be like encountering an H-bomb.\u201d Regis 2013, \u201cBeing Told That Our Destiny Is Among The Stars.\u201d</p><p><sup><sup>[37]</sup></sup> Calculations were based on WolframAlpha\u2019s formula for relativistic kinetic energy.

Individual particles with masses as high as 10^-12 kg (4.5 \u03bcm radius) are almost certainly present. Moreover, radar detections of interstellar dust particles entering the Earth\u2019s atmosphere ([27] and references therein) imply a population of interstellar grains with masses &gt; 3*10-10 kg (corresponding to radii &gt; 30 \u03bcm). While there are difficulties reconciling the presence of such large grains with other astronomical observations [36], a conservative planning assumption would be that particles as large as 100 \u03bcm radius (10^-8 kg), and perhaps larger, might be encountered in the course of a several light-year journey through the LISM. The kinetic energy of such large particles striking an interstellar space vehicle with a relative velocity of 0.1c are considerable (4.5*10^6 J), and some kind of active dust detection and mitigation system may need to be considered.</p><p><sup><sup>[39]</sup></sup> \u201cSomeone might question whether it\u2019s possible to create electronic devices that would work for very long periods of time in the presence of radiation, as would be necessary for space colonization.

This rule says a short-term effective population size (Ne) of 50 is needed to prevent an unacceptable rate of inbreeding, whereas a long\u2010term Ne of 500 is required to maintain overall genetic variability. The Ne = 50 prescription corresponds to an inbreeding rate of 1% per generation, approximately half the maximum rate tolerated by domestic animal breeders.

I have not yet looked closely at this paper, and feel it would take a substantial effort on my part to tell whether the idea would hold up.

It\u2019s just a question of how fast we can get there.\u201d Notes from a conversation with Robert Zubrin.</p><p><sup><sup>[49]</sup></sup> \u201cIt\u2019s possible that there are unknown obstacles. Most of the obstacles we\u2019ve discussed seem like they could be overcome. If they can and these are the only obstacles, that makes the Fermi Paradox more puzzling. Someone could argue that this suggests that interstellar colonization is impossible for some unknown reason.\u201d Notes from a conversation with Geoffrey Landis.</p><p><sup><sup>[50]</sup></sup> See Wikipedia, \u201cFermi\u2019s Paradox\u201d for further discussion.</p><p><sup><sup>[51]</sup></sup> \u201cCreating a civilization of this size outside of the Earth would require a very large economic investment, and one that could (at best) have only a very long-term payoff. We currently do not have institutions which function well for highly unprecedented ventures which would require decades\u2014or perhaps even centuries\u2014to pay off.

{"date": "5th Dec 2014", "title": "Economic altruism", "author": "Paul_Christiano", "num_comments": "4 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Alice and Bob have joint ownership of a pie, and they would like to split it. If they want to do anything other than split it evenly, there are two common approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Altruism. </strong>They talk it out, determine who likes pie more, and implement the socially optimal allocation.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic self-interest.\u00a0</strong>Each gets half of the pie, and if one of them likes pie more they can buy the other out. Each acts in their own self-interest.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think the best approach is in between:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Economic altruism. </strong>Each says how much they would be willing to pay for the pie. The price of the pie is the average, and the high bidder buys out the loser.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[ETA: Jess points out that Bethany already has <a href=\"http://messymatters.com/autonomy\">a nice post about very similar ideas</a>.]</p>\n<p>This scheme has three excellent properties:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is optimal, if everyone behaves honestly.</li>\n<li>It involves only local decisions. Each participant only has to answer: how much do <em>I </em>want X?</li>\n<li>It is robust: if someone behaves dishonestly, makes mistakes, or communicates incorrectly, the worst they can do is \u201cwalk away\u201d with their half of the pie.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Economic self-interest fails on count [1]. Whenever there is a surplus to be divided, economically rational agents will fight to capture more of it. And in their efforts, they <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myerson%E2%80%93Satterthwaite_theorem\">will typically</a> make things worse. Alice will overstate how much she likes pie to sell it for more, and Bob will understate how much he likes pie to buy it for less. And in the end, too little pie will be exchanged. Not sharing information is another canonical way to capture a large share of a smaller surplus.</p>\n<p>Altruism fails on counts [2] and [3]. If you can count on everyone to be honest, then altruism gets you to an optimal outcome\u200a\u2014\u200abut so does economic altruism. And thinking about what other people want is hard. In practice, I would expect the altruists to just split the pie fairly, which is uninspiring.</p>\n<p>The general principle is: \u201cMake good deals, but don\u2019t worry about how you split the surplus.\u201d The part where you split the surplus evenly isn\u2019t really important, though 50\u201350 is a nice Schelling point.</p>\n<p>Economic behavior can help make efficient, robust decisions. You don\u2019t need to give up on altruism to get those benefits. And conversely, altruism can grease the wheels of trade. I think economic altruism is a good attitude towards many interactions between nice people. If you can\u2019t see how it applies to a particular situation, odds are you aren\u2019t looking hard enough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I <em>almost</em> stopped there and successfully wrote a short post. But I can't resist raising and addressing possible problems. Read on only if you have the stamina for it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Problems\">Problems</h1>\n<p><strong>Issue 1</strong>: Quantifying things is hard. Alice might have an easier time thinking <em>qualitatively </em>about what Bob wants than thinking\u00a0<em>quantitatively </em>about what Alice wants. But based on experience I think that this is a matter of practice\u200a\u2014\u200aand that it\u2019s good practice.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the bigger problem is that when people quantify they also feel the need to be <em>precise. </em>When they can\u2019t be precise, they don\u2019t want to quantify, and when they see something quantified, they assume it is precise. This is a trap. It doesn\u2019t matter that much if you guess wrong about which of Alice and Bob most wants the pie. And it doesn\u2019t matter that much if you guess wrong about whether the pie is worth $1 or $3. Just go with your best guess; it\u2019s what you were doing anyway.</p>\n<p>Taking time to make a better estimate is useful if it helps you better allocate the pie\u200a\u2014\u200abut that would have been helpful even if you weren\u2019t quantifying. Taking time to make a better estimate might also help you get <em>exactly </em>what you are owed, rather than a noisy estimate; but just because you are being quantitative doesn't mean you have to start fighting over the surplus. (Though see the discussion of adverse selection below.)</p>\n<p>Quantifying willingness to pay also makes our motives more explicit, where we might prefer them remain implicit. I'm not going to dwell on this point, but I will suggest that transparency is actually an important social good, and we should actually try to encourage it. It's unrealistic to be transparent about everything, but we can at least be a bit more transparent.</p>\n<p>Comparing between \u201cAlice gets a pie\u201d and \u201cBob gets a pie\u201d doesn\u2019t seem fundamentally easier than comparing between \u201cAlice gets a pie\u201d and \u201cAlice gets $2.\u201d And if Alice can\u2019t make the second kind of decision, she has bigger problems than being unable to efficiently split a pie with Bob.</p>\n<p><strong>Issue 2</strong>: People don\u2019t like dealing with money. That\u2019s fine\u200a\u2014\u200aeconomics isn\u2019t about money. If Alice and Bob often interact, they can trade pie for hamburgers or labor or whatever.</p>\n<p>Or they can introduce a new currency only for use in Alice-Bob trades. The hard part is specifying how Alice and Bob should make decisions about this fictional currency, given that it has no intrinsic value. I\u2019ll leave the details to the reader or to a future post. (One short answer is \u201clogarithmic returns to fictional money\u201d.) Also note the analogy with real currency.</p>\n<p>Or two altruists can trade <a href=\"/ea/ak/certificates_of_impact/\">certificates of impact</a> if they both use that system. You can do the same with donations; this has a number of problems, but might still work better than directly exchanging cash.</p>\n<p><strong>Issue 3</strong>: When dealing with profit-seekers who know more than you, you need a bid-ask spread to compensate for adverse selection. If someone is willing to sell you a car, it\u2019s more likely to be junk. This breaks property [3]: it is possible for a dishonest participant to do harm. So with a profit-seeking counterparty, you should be willing to buy only at a strictly lower price than you are willing to sell. As a result, deals happen less often than would be optimal.</p>\n<p>Homo economicus only holds back information to capture more of the surplus. So altruists share relevant information. And when dealing with an altruist, you don't want a spread beyond the transaction costs.</p>\n<p>To be very explicit about it, you might even ask \"is there anything else I should know?\", behave altruistically if you get a straight answer, and only be vulnerable to active malice.</p>\n<p>If I\u2019m dealing with a stranger from the internet, then I anticipate adverse selection from the outset. Being nice doesn\u2019t mean being a fool. But for repeat interactions, I normally assume innocence and only defect when it becomes necessary---e.g. if you and I interact every day, I won't charge you a spread until I see that it is necessary.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Issue 4</strong>: Does this ever come up? Is there really room for improvement? I think so. And if you have it in mind\u200a\u2014\u200aif you compare the decisions we <em>actually </em>make to the best decisions we <em>could </em>make\u200a\u2014\u200aI think that you too will see it all around you.</p></div></div>"},

Of course a huge amount of research bears on this question, but I'm most interested in research that addresses its distinctive characteristics.

I think <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/givewell-labs\">GiveWell Labs</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/\">Copenhagen Consensus Center</a> are the two most salient examples of this work, though they have quite different approaches. I understand that the <a href=\"http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">Centre for Effective Altruism</a>\u00a0(CEA) is beginning to invest in this area as well. I think this is an area where people will be able to get a lot of traction (and have already done pretty well for the amount of investment I'm aware of) and I think it will probably go a very long way towards facilitating issue-agnostic giving.</li>\n\t<li>Research that aims to understand and compare the long-term impacts of the short-term changes which our investments can directly bring about. For example, research that clarifies and compares the long-term impact of poverty alleviation, technological progress, or environmental preservation, and how important that long-term impact is. This is an area where answers are much harder to come by, but even slight improvements in our understanding would have significant importance for a very broad range of decisions. It appears that high-quality work in this area is pretty rare, though it's a bit hard to tell if this is due to very little investment or if this is merely evidence that making progress on these problems is too difficult. I tend to lean towards the former, because (a) we see very little public discussion of process and failed attempts for high-quality research on these issues, which you should expect to see even if they are quite challenging, and (b) this is not an area that I expect to receive a lot of investment except by cause-agnostic altruists who are looking quite far ahead. I think the most convincing example to date is Nick Bostrom's <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/files/AstronomicalWaste.pdf\">astronomical waste argument</a> and Nick Beckstead's <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxuYmVja3N0ZWFkfGd4OjExNDBjZTcwNjMxMzRmZGE\">more extensive discussion of the importance of the far future</a>, which seem to take a small but reasonably robust step towards improving our understanding of what to do.</li>\n</ol>\nThere are certainly other relevant research areas, but they tend to be less interesting as cause prioritization per se. For example, there is a lot of work that tries to better understand the impact of particular interventions. I think this is comparably important to (1) or (2), but that it currently receives quite a lot more attention at the moment and it's not clear that a cause-agnostic philanthropist would want to change how this is being done. More tangentially, efforts to improve forecasts more broadly have significant relevance for philanthropic investment, though they are even more important in other domains so prima facie it would be a bit surprising if these efforts ought to be a priority by virtue of their impact on improving philanthropic decision-making.<p></p><p><strong>Pablo</strong>: In public talks and private conversation, you have argued that instead of supporting any of the object-level interventions that look most promising on the evidence currently available, we should on the current margin invest in research on understanding which of those opportunities are most effective. \u00a0Could you give us an outline of this argument?</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>: It seems very likely to me that more research will lead to a much clearer picture of the relative merits of different opportunities, so I suspect in the future we will be much better equipped to pick winners. I would not be at all surprised if supporting my best guess charity ten years from now was several times more impactful than supporting my best guess charity now.</p><p>If you are this optimistic about learning more, then it is generally better to donate to your best guess charity in a decade, rather than donating to your current best guess. But if you think there is room for more funding to help accelerate that learning process, then that might be an even better idea. I think this is the case at the moment: the learning process is mostly driven by people doing prioritization research and exploratory philanthropy, and total investment in that area is not very large.</p><p>Of course, giving to object level interventions may be an important part of learning more, and so I would be hesitant to say that we should avoid investment in object-level problems. However, I think that investment should really be focused on learning and exploring (in a way that can help other people make these decisions as well, not just the individual donor) rather than for a direct positive impact. \u00a0So for example I\u2019m not very interested in scaling up successful global health interventions.</p><p>The most salient motivation to do good now, rather than learning or waiting, is a discount rate that is much steeper than market rates of return.</p><p>For example, you might give now if you thought your philanthropic investments would earn very high effective rates of return. I think this is unlikely for the kinds of object-level investments most philanthropists consider--I think most of these investments compound roughly in line with the global growth rate (which is smaller than market rates of return).</p><p>You might also have a high discount rate if you thought that the future was likely to have much worse philanthropic opportunities; but as far as I can tell a philanthropist today has just as many problems to solve as a philanthropist 20 years ago, and frankly I can see a lot of possible problems on the horizon for a philanthropist to invest in, so I find this compelling.</p><p>Sometimes \u201cmovement-building\u201d is offered as an example of an activity with very high rates of returns. At the moment I am somewhat skeptical of these claims, and my suspicion is that it is more important for the \u201ceffective altruism\u201d movement to have a fundamentally good product and to generally have our act together than for it to grow more rapidly, and I think one could also give a strong justification for prioritization research even if you were primarily interested in movement-building. But that is a much longer discussion.</p><p><strong>Pablo</strong>: I think it would be interesting to examine more closely the object-level causes supported by EAs or proto-EAs in the past (over, say, the last decade), and use that examination to inform our estimates about the degree to which the value of future EA-supported causes will exceed that of causes that EAs support today. \u00a0Off the top of my head, the EAs I can think of who have donation records long enough to draw meaningful conclusions all have in the past supported causes that they would now regard as being significantly worse than those they currently favour. \u00a0So this would provide further evidence for one of the premises in your argument: that cause prioritization research can uncover interventions of high impact relative to our current best guesses.</p><p>The other premise in your argument, as I understand it, is that the value of the interventions we should expect cause prioritization research to uncover is high relative to the opportunity cost of current spending. Can you elaborate on the considerations that are, in your opinion, relevant for assessing this premise?</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>: Sorry, this is going to be a bit of a long and technical response. I see three compelling reasons to prefer giving today to giving in the future. But altogether they don\u2019t seem to be a big deal compared to how much more we would expect to know in the future. Again, I think that using giving as an opportunity to learn stands out as an exception here--because in that case we can say with much more confidence that we will need to learn more at some point, and so the investment today is not much of a lost cause.\n</p><ol>\n\t<li>The actual good you do in the world compounds over time, so it is better to do good sooner than later.</li>\n\t<li>There are problems today that won\u2019t exist in the future, so money in the future may be substantially less valuable than money today.</li>\n\t<li>In the future there will be a larger pool of \u201csmart money\u201d that finds the best charitable opportunities, so there will be fewer opportunities to do good.</li>\n</ol>\nRegarding (1), I think that the vast majority of charitable activities people engage in simply do not compound that quickly. To illustrate, you might consider the case of a cash transfer to a poor family. Initially such a cash transfer earns a very high rate of return, but over time the positive impact diffuses over a broader and broader group of people. As it diffuses to a broader group, the returns approach the general rate of growth in the world, which is substantially smaller than the interest rate. Most other forms of good experience a very similar pattern. So if this were the only reason to give sooner, then I think that you would actually be better served by saving and earning prevailing interest rates for an extra year, and then donating a year later--even if you didn\u2019t expect to learn anything new.<p></p><p>A mistake I sometimes see people make is using the initial rates of return on an investment to judge its urgency. But those returns last for a brief period before spreading out into the broader world, so you should really think of the investment as giving you a fixed multiplier on your dollar before spreading out and having a long-term returns that go like growth rates. It doesn\u2019t matter whether that multiplier accrues instantaneously or over a period of a few years during which you enjoy excess returns. In either case the magnitude of the multiplier is not relevant to the urgency of giving, just whether the multiplier is going up or down.</p><p>A category of good which is plausibly exceptional here is creating additional resources that will flexibly pursue good opportunities in the future. I\u2019m aware that some folks around CEA assign very high rates of return, in excess of 30% / year, to investment in movement-building and outreach. I think this is an epistemic error, but that would probably be a longer discussion so it might be easier to restrict attention to object-level interventions vs. focusing on learning.</p><p>Regarding (2), I don\u2019t really see the evidence for this position. From my perspective the problems the world faces today seem more important--in particular, they have more significant long-term consequences--than the problems the world faced 200 years ago. It looks to me like this trend is likely to continue, and there is a good chance that further technological development will continue to introduce problems with an unprecedented potential impact on the future. So with respect to object-level work I\u2019d prefer to address the problems of today than the problems of 200 years ago, and I think I\u2019d probably be even happier addressing the problems we face 50 years.</p><p>Regarding (3), I do see this as a fairly compelling reason to move sooner rather than later. I think the question is one of magnitudes: how long do you expect it will take before the pool of \u201csmart money\u201d is twice as large? 10 times larger? I think it\u2019s very easy to overestimate the extent to which this group is growing. It is only at extremely exceptional points in history that this pool can grow 20% faster than economic growth. For example, if you are starting from a baseline of 0.1% of total philanthropic spending, that can only go up 20% per year for 40 years or so before you get to 100% of spending. On the flip side, I think it is pretty easy to look around at what is going on locally and mistakenly conclude that the world must be changing pretty rapidly.</p><p>I think most of what we are seeing isn\u2019t a changing balance between smart money and ordinary folk, it\u2019s continuously increasing sophistication on the part donors collectively--this is a process that can go on for a very long time. In this case, it\u2019s not so clear why you would want to give earlier when you are one of many unsophisticated donors rather than giving later when you are one of many sophisticated donors, even if you were only learning as fast as everyone else in the world. The thing that drives the discount rate earlier was the belief that other donors were getting sophisticated faster than we are, so that our relative importance was shrinking. And that no longer seems to apply when you look at it as a community increasing in sophistication.</p><p>So overall, I see the reasons for urgency in giving to be relatively weak, and I think the question of whether to give or save would be ambiguous (setting aside psychological motivations, the desire to learn more, and social effects of giving now) even if we weren\u2019t learning more.</p><p><strong>Pablo</strong>: Recently, a few EAs have questioned that charities vary in cost-effectiveness to the degree that is usually claimed within the EA community. \u00a0Brian Tomasik, for instance, argues that <a href=\"http://utilitarian-essays.com/why-charities-do-not-differ-astronomically.html\">charities differ by at most 10 to 100 times</a> (and much less so within a given field). Do you think that arguments of this sort could weaken the case for supporting research into cause prioritization, or change the type of cause prioritization research that EAs should support?</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>: I think there are two conceptually distinct issues here which should be discussed separately, at least in this context.</p><p>One is the observation that a small group looking for good buys may not have as large an influence as it seems, if they will just end up slightly crowding out a much larger pool of thoughtful money. The bar for \u201cthoughtful\u201d isn\u2019t that high, it just needs to be sensitive to diminishing returns in the area that is funded. There are two big reasons why this is not so troubling:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>Money that is smart enough to be sensitive to diminishing marginal returns--and moreover which is sufficiently cause-agnostic to move between different fields on the basis of efficiency considerations--is also likely to be smart enough to respond to significant changes in the evidence and arguments for a particular intervention. So I think doing research publicly and contributing to a stock of public knowledge about different causes is not subject to such severe problems.</li>\n\t<li>The number of possible giving opportunities is really quite large compared to the number of charitable organizations. If you are looking for the best opportunities, in the long-term you are probably going to be contributing to the existence of new organizations working in areas which would not otherwise exist. This is especially true if we expect to use early investigations to help direct our focus in later investigations. This is very closely related to the last point.</li>\n</ul>\nThis issue is most severe when we consider trying to pursue idiosyncratic interests, like an unusually large degree of concern for the far future. So this consideration does make me a bit less enthusiastic about that, which is something I\u2019ve written about before. Nevertheless, I think in that space there are many possible opportunities which are simply not going to get any support from people who aren\u2019t thinking about the far future, so there still seems to be a lot of good to do by improving our understanding.<p></p><p>A second issue is that broad social improvements will tend to have a positive effect on society\u2019s ability to resolve many different problems. So if there is any exceptionally impactful thing for society to do, then that will also multiply the impact of many different interventions. I don\u2019t think this consideration says too much about the desirability of prioritization: quite large differences are very consistent with this observation, these differences can be substantially compounded by uncertainty about whether the indirect effects of an intervention are good and bad, and there is substantial variation even in very broad measures of the impact of different interventions. This consideration does suggest that you should pay more attention to very high-impact interventions even if the long-term significance of that impact is at first ambiguous.</p><p><strong>Pablo</strong>: Finally, what do you think is the most effective way to promote cause prioritization research? \u00a0If an effective altruist reading this interview is persuaded by your arguments, what should this person do?</p><p><strong>Paul</strong>: One conclusion is that it would be premature to settle on an area that currently looks particularly attractive and simply scale up the best-looking program in that area. For example, I would be hesitant to support an intervention in global health (or indeed in most areas) unless I thought that supporting that intervention was a cost-effective way to improve our understanding of global health more broadly. That could be because executing the intervention would provide useful information and understanding that could be publicly shared, or because supporting it would help strengthen the involvement of EA\u2019s in the space and so help EA\u2019s in particular improve their understanding. One could say the same thing about more speculative causes: investments that don\u2019t provide much feedback or help us understand the space better are probably not at the top of my priority list.</p><p>Relatedly, I think that global health receives a lot of attention because it is a particularly straightforward area to do good in; I think that\u2019s quite important if you want your dollar to do as much good directly as possible, but that it is much less important (and important in a different way) if you are paying appropriate attention to the value of learning and information.</p><p>Another takeaway is that it may be worth actively supporting this research, either by supporting organizations that do it or by giving on the basis of early research. I think Good Ventures and GiveWell Labs are currently the most credible effort in this space (largely by virtue of having done much more research in this space than any other comparably EA-aligned organization), and so providing support for them to scale up that research is probably the most straightforward way to directly support cause prioritization. There are some concerns about GiveWell Labs capturing only half of marginal funding, or about substituting with Good Ventures\u2019 funding; that would again be a longer and much more complicated discussion. My view would be that those issues are worth thinking about but probably not deal-breakers.</p><p>I hear that CEA may be looking to invest more in this area going forward, and so supporting CEA is also a possible approach. To date they have not spent much time in this area and so it is difficult to predict what the output will look like. To the extent that this kind of chicken-and-egg problem is a substantial impediment to trying new things faster and you have confidence in CEA as an organization, providing funding to help plausible-looking experiments get going might be quite cost-effective.</p><p>A final takeaway is that the balance between money and human capital looks quite different for philanthropic research than for many object-level interventions. If an EA is interested in scaling up proven interventions, it\u2019s very likely that their comparative advantage is elsewhere and they are better served by <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/category/earning-to-give/\">earning money and distributing it to charities doing the work they are most excited about</a>. But if you think that increasing philanthropic capacity is very important, it becomes more plausible that the best use of time for a motivated EA is to work directly on related problems. That might mean working for an \u201cEA\u201d organization, working within the philanthropy sector more broadly, or pursuing a career somewhere else entirely. Once we are talking about applying human capital rather than money, ability and enthusiasm for a particular project becomes a very large consideration (though the kinds of considerations we\u2019ve discussed in this interview can be another important input).</p></div></div>"},

We justify the principle, explore the relation with Umeshisms, and look at applications in priority-setting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Some_trade_offs\">Some trade-offs</h2>\n<p>How much should you spend on your bike lock? A cheaper lock saves you money at the cost of security.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>How long should you spend weighing up which charity to donate to before choosing one? Longer means less time for doing other useful things, but you\u2019re more likely to make a good choice.</p>\n<p>How early should you aim to arrive at the station for your train? Earlier means less chance of missing it, but more time hanging around at the station.</p>\n<p>Should you be willing to undertake risky projects, or stick only to safe ones? The safer your threshold, the more confident you can be that you won\u2019t waste resources, but some of the best opportunities may have a degree of risk, and you might be able to achieve a lot more with a weaker constraint.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_principle\"><strong>The principle</strong></h2>\n<p>We face trade-offs and make judgements all the time, and inevitably we sometimes make bad calls. In some cases we should have known better; sometimes we are just unlucky. As well as trying to make fewer mistakes, we should try to minimise the damage from the mistakes that we do make.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a rule which can be useful in helping you do this:</p>\n<p>When making decisions that lie along a spectrum, you should choose so that you think you have some chance of being off from the best choice in each direction.</p>\n<p>We could call this principle <em>erring in both directions</em>. It might seem counterintuitive -- isn\u2019t it worse to not even know what direction you\u2019re wrong in? -- but it\u2019s based on some fairly straightforward economics. I give a non-technical sketch of a proof at the end, but the essence is: if you\u2019re not going to be perfect, you want to be close to perfect, and this is best achieved by putting your actual choice near the middle of your error bar.</p>\n<p>So the principle suggests that you should aim to arrive at the station with a bit of time wasted, but not so much that you won\u2019t miss the train even if something goes wrong.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Refinements\">Refinements</h3>\n<p>Just saying that you should have some chance of erring in either direction isn\u2019t enough to tell you what you should actually choose. It can be a useful warning sign in the cases where you\u2019re going substantially wrong, though, and as these are the most important cases to fix it has some use in this form.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A more careful analysis would tell you that at the best point on the spectrum, a small change in your decision produces about as much expected benefit as expected cost. In ideal circumstances we can use this to work out exactly where on the spectrum we should be (in some cases more than one point may fit this, so you need to compare them directly). In practice it is often hard to estimate the marginal benefits and costs well enough for this to be useful approach. So although it is theoretically optimal, you will only sometimes want to try to apply this version.</p>\n<p>Say in our train example that you found missing the train as bad as 100 minutes waiting at the station. Then you want to leave time so that an extra minute of safety margin gives you a 1% reduction in the absolute chance of missing the train.</p>\n<p>For instance, say your options in the train case look like this: \n</p><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Safety margin (min)</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chance of missing train (%)</td>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1.5</td>\n<td>1.1</td>\n<td>0.8</td>\n<td>0.6</td>\n<td>0.4</td>\n<td>0.3</td>\n<td>0.2</td>\n<td>0.1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nThen the optimal safety margin to leave is somewhere between 6 and 7 minutes: this is where the marginal minute leads to a 1% reduction in the chance of missing the train.\n<h2 id=\"Predictions_and_track_records\">Predictions and track records</h2>\n<p>So far, we've phrased the idea in terms of the predicted outcomes of actions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another more well-known perspective on the idea looks at events that have already happened. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cIf you've never missed a flight, you're spending too much time in airports.\u201d</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://arcanesentiment.blogspot.co.uk/2010/01/umeshism.html\">\u201cIf your code never has bugs, you\u2019re being too careful.\u201d</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These formulations, <a href=\"http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=40\">dubbed 'Umeshisms'</a>, only work for decisions that you make multiple times, so that you can gather a track record.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An advantage of applying the principle to track records is that it\u2019s more obvious when you\u2019re going wrong. Introspection can be hard.</p>\n<p>You can even apply the principle to track records of decisions which don\u2019t look like they are choosing from a spectrum. For example it is given as advice in the game of bridge: if you don\u2019t sometimes double the stakes on hands which eventually go against you, you\u2019re not doubling enough. Although doubling or not is a binary choice, erring in both directions still works because \u2018how often to do double\u2019 is a trait that roughly falls on a spectrum.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Failures\">Failures</h2>\n<p>There are some circumstances where the principle may not apply.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>First, if you think the correct point is at one extreme of the available spectrum. For instance nobody says \u2018if you\u2019re not worried about going to jail, you\u2019re not committing enough armed robberies\u2019, because we think the best number of armed robberies to commit is probably zero.</p>\n<p>Second, if the available points in the spectrum are discrete and few in number. Take the example of the bike locks. Perhaps there are only three options available: the Cheap-o lock (\u00a35), the Regular lock (\u00a320), and the Super lock (\u00a350). You might reasonably decide on the Regular lock, thinking that maybe the Super lock is better, but that the Cheap-o one certainly isn\u2019t. When you buy the Regular lock, you\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019re not buying a lock that\u2019s too tough. But since only two of the locks are good candidates, there is no decision you <em>could </em>make which tries to err in both directions.</p>\n<p>Third, in the case of evaluating track records, it may be that your record isn\u2019t long enough to expect to have seen errors in both directions, even if they should both come up eventually. If you haven\u2019t flown that many times, you could well be spending the right amount of time -- or even too little -- in airports, even if you\u2019ve never missed a flight.</p>\n<p>Finally, a warning about a case where the principle is not supposed to apply. It shouldn\u2019t be applied directly to try to equalise the probability of being wrong in either direction, without taking any account of magnitude of loss. So for example if someone says you should err on the side of caution by getting an early train to your job interview, it might look as though that were in conflict with the idea of erring in both directions. But normally what\u2019s meant is that you should have a higher probability of failing in one direction (wasting time by taking an earlier train than needed), <em>because</em> the consequences of failing in the other direction (missing the interview) are much higher.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusions_and_applications_to_prioritisation\">Conclusions and applications to prioritisation</h2>\n<p>Seeking to err in both directions can provide a useful tool in helping to form better judgements in uncertain situations. Many people may already have internalised key points, but it can be useful to have a label to facilitate discussion. Additionally, having a clear principle can help you to apply it in cases where you might not have noticed it was relevant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>How might this principle apply to priority-setting? It suggests that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You should spend enough time and resources on the prioritisation itself that you think some of time may have been wasted (for example you should spend a while at the end without changing your mind much), but not so much that you are totally confident you have the right answer.</li>\n<li>If you are unsure what discount rate to use, you should choose one so that you think that it could be either too high or too low.</li>\n<li>If you don\u2019t know how strongly to weigh fragile cost-effectiveness estimates against more robust evidence, you should choose a level so that you might be over- or under-weighing them.</li>\n<li>When you are providing a best-guess estimate, you should choose a figure which could plausibly be wrong either way.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And one on track records:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suppose you\u2019ve made lots of grants. Then if you\u2019ve never backed a project which has failed, you\u2019re probably too risk-averse in your grantmaking.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Appendix__a_sketch_proof_of_the_principle\">Appendix: a sketch proof of the principle</h2>\n<p>Assume the true graph of value (on the vertical axis) against the decision you make (on the horizontal axis, representing the spectrum) is smooth, looking something like this:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span><img src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/s4bPrmx_PQtz3TEkCD0Wncg/image?w=624&amp;h=229&amp;rev=45&amp;ac=1\" alt=\"\"></span></span></p>\n<p>The highest value is achieved at d, so this is where you\u2019d like to be. But assume you don\u2019t know quite where d is. Say your best guess is that d=g. But you think it\u2019s quite possible that d&gt;g, and quite unlikely that d&lt;g. Should you choose g?</p>\n<p>Suppose we compare g to g\u2019, which is just a little bit bigger than g. If d&gt;g, then switching from g to g\u2019 would be moving up the slope on the left of the diagram, which is an improvement. If d=g then it would be better to stick with g, but it doesn\u2019t make so much difference because the curve is fairly flat at the top. And if g were bigger than d, we\u2019d be moving down the slope on the right of the diagram, which is worse for g\u2019 -- but this scenario was deemed unlikely.</p>\n<p>Aggregating the three possibilities, we found that two of them were better for sticking with g, but in one of these (d=g) it didn\u2019t matter very much, and the other (d&lt;g) just wasn\u2019t very likely. In contrast, the third case (d&gt;g) was reasonably likely, and noticeably better for g\u2019 than g. So overall we should prefer g\u2019 to g.</p>\n<p>In fact we\u2019d want to continue moving until the marginal upside from going slightly higher was equal to the marginal downside; this would have to involve a non-trivial chance that we are going too high. So our choice should have a chance of failure in either direction. This completes the (sketch) proof.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: There was an assumption of smoothness in this argument. I suspect it may be possible to get slightly stronger conclusions or work from slightly weaker assumptions, but I\u2019m not certain what the most general form of this argument is. It is often easier to build a careful argument in specific cases.</p>\n<p><em>Acknowledgements: thanks to Ryan Carey, Max Dalton, and Toby Ord for useful comments and suggestions.</em></p></div></div>"},

But if you\u2019re anything like me, you struggle to come up with presents for people to get you, not wanting to accumulate yet more stuff. You may even have stopped getting presents from friends or family. Or perhaps you don\u2019t like to ask for things for yourself, or don\u2019t buy into the materialism and consumerism of it all.</p>\n<p>If this description fits you then you may be interested in running one of Charity Science\u2019s Christmas fundraisers. These provide a webpage through which your family and friends can easily donate to one of the world\u2019s best charities, as a present to you. You simply tell them that this is what you\u2019d like. You can <a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/christmas-fundraisers.html\">find suggested messages here</a>, and we provide default copy for your fundraiser page, so it\u2019s very easy on your part. If people want to give you something physical, we provide illustrated tokens (pictured above) that they can print out or email. And there\u2019s a way to have your donations be revealed on Christmas day.\u00a0<strong>All donations get matched dollar-for-dollar too.</strong></p>\n<p>We\u2019ve helped many people run similar fundraisers for their birthdays, and these have got great reactions from their friends and family, raising hundreds or thousands of dollars each - <a href=\"http://birthday.causevox.com/\">one raised $7,000</a>! This was so even when people hadn\u2019t received presents for years, so if you\u2019re in that boat then there\u2019s no need to let it put you off - instead, see it as the first present for some time that\u2019s been worth asking for. When you can treat someone for worms for $1 or distribute a bednet for $6, it\u2019s worth starting getting presents again - and you\u2019ll also be sharing a great opportunity with the people you tell! This outreach effect is another reason to run a fundraiser.</p>\n<p>Christmas is the classic time of year to talk about giving, and a time when people can fundraise for charity without appearing pushy. <strong>So why not take this opportunity and </strong><strong>create a Christmas fundraiser now</strong><strong>, or </strong><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/christmas-fundraisers.html#788349117760338128\">register your interest</a><strong>?</strong> Donations to the world\u2019s best charities are a chance to save and improve lives - and a present worth asking for.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://uschristmas.causevox.com/\">Create a fundraiser in the US</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://christmas.causevox.com/\">Create a fundraiser in Canada</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ukchristmas.causevox.com/\">Create a fundraiser in the UK</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ozchristmas.causevox.com/\">Create a fundraiser in Australia</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},

{"date": "23rd Dec 2014", "title": "Factoring cost-effectiveness", "author": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt", "num_comments": "3 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: We can split the cost-effectiveness of an intervention into how good the cause is, and how good the intervention is relative to the cause. This perspective could help our efforts in prioritisation by letting us bring appropriate tools to bear on the different parts.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"Cost_effectiveness_comparisons\">Cost-effectiveness comparisons</h2>\n<p>When we choose between giving time or money to different interventions, we\u2019re making a comparison. It\u2019s nice to know what these comparisons come down to. There are a lot of sources of evidence, and different ones will be more appropriate in different contexts.</p>\n<p>Say we are comparing between intervention <em>x</em> in cause area X, and intervention <em>y</em> in cause area Y. How they compare depends on things like how well thought-out <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are, how competent the people and organisations implementing them are, as well as how valuable X is as a whole compared to Y.</p>\n<p>These are all important factors in telling us how <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> ultimately compare, but they\u2019re quite different from one another. So it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise if it\u2019s best to use different methods to compare the different factors. I think this is the case.</p>\n<p>Consider the equation:</p>\n<h6><strong>Cost-effectiveness of intervention = (cost-effectiveness of area) * (leverage ratio of intervention)</strong></h6>\n<p><strong></strong> The left-hand side of this equation expresses how much good is achieved per unit of resources invested in the intervention. For the intervention <em>x</em> we\u2019ll denote this G(<em>x</em>). The right-hand side breaks this up as C(X), how much good is achieved per unit of resources invested in X as a whole, and a \u2018leverage ratio\u2019 L(<em>x</em>) which expresses the ratio of how effective <em>x</em> is compared to X as a whole [1].</p>\n<p>Now to compare between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> we\u2019re interested in the ratio G(<em>x</em>)/G(<em>y</em>). We can use the above equation to expand this:</p>\n<p>G(<em>x</em>)/G(<em>y</em>) = (C(X)L(<em>x</em>))/(C(Y)L(<em>y</em>)).</p>\n<p>This rearranges to:</p>\n<p>G(<em>x</em>)/G(<em>y</em>) = C(X)/C(Y) * L(<em>x</em>)/L(<em>y</em>).</p>\n<p>Here we\u2019ve split the comparison into two parts, each of which is comparing like with like. This is a good general strategy: making comparisons between dissimilar things is hard, and our intuitions are sometimes terrible at it, so it\u2019s helpful to break it into more comparable chunks [2].</p>\n<h2 id=\"Comparing_cause_effectiveness\">Comparing cause effectiveness</h2>\n<p>Comparing the cost-effectiveness of different cause areas is quite far removed from everyday experience, and it doesn\u2019t have a good feedback mechanism as it can be hard to tell how much something helped the world even after the fact. Moreover it\u2019s just the right setting for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_neglect\">scope insensitivity</a>\u00a0to cause problems for intuitive judgements. This means that relative to most areas of experience, we should be particularly cautious about putting too much weight on intuitive judgements. This in turn means that it\u2019s an area where explicit models are particularly valuable.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean that explicit models always trump intuitive judgements in this domain; in particular, simple models often omit important factors that are incorporated into our intuitions. <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/06/10/sequence-thinking-vs-cluster-thinking/\">Nor does it mean that we should put all our trust into a single model</a>.\u00a0But it does mean that it\u2019s particularly valuable to build, critique, and refine models for the cost-effectiveness of different causes. It also means we should put <a href=\"http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/estimation-is-the-best-we-have/\">more weight on the outputs of such models</a>\u00a0than we do in most domains -- not because the models are more trustworthy, but because the alternatives are worse than usual. This is why I think developing such models is a high value activity, and why I\u2019ve been <a href=\"/ea/c3/estimating_the_costeffectiveness_of_research/\">spending time on it</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Comparing_leverage_ratios\">Comparing leverage ratios</h2>\n<p>The leverage ratios are determined largely by things like: whether the intervention is a sensible way of progressing on the cause; the quality of the team involved; how functional the implementing organisation is. In contrast to the overall effectiveness of a cause, these are the much closer to regular experience, so we should be less keen to use explicit models. On the other hand, methods and experience from valuing shares of companies (which have good feedback mechanisms) should be relevant in this context.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons why leverage ratios may vary within a cause area. Many of these will be common across cause areas. Because of this, we might expect similar distributions of leverage ratios in different cause areas (but probably some areas have more variance than others, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/09/how-good-are-the-best/\">just as some jobs have more variance in the productivity of employees than others</a>). It could be valuable to have an idea of how much leverage ratios do vary in practice. This is an empirical question we might be able to get data for.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Implications_for_prioritisation_work\">Implications for prioritisation work</h2>\n<p>To choose between interventions, we need to compare cost-effectiveness. I\u2019ve claimed that this is best done by comparing the cost-effectiveness of cause areas, and comparing the leverage ratios of the interventions. If this is right, what\u2019s more valuable to work on evaluating?</p>\n<p>Of course they are complementary to each other. The better we are able to identify the best cause areas, the more valuable it is to have good estimates for the leverage ratios of interventions in those areas. And the better we are able to identify interventions with very high leverage ratios, the more valuable it is to be able to say which of those are in the most effective causes. So the answer depends in part on how much work each is already receiving.</p>\n<p>It also depends on your beliefs about which component has more variance. If you think that most of the variation in intervention effectiveness comes from leverage ratios, while cost-effectiveness of causes doesn\u2019t vary that much, then it\u2019s more important to evaluate the leverage ratios of interventions. If on the other hand you think more variation comes between causes, then it\u2019s more important to evaluate cause effectiveness. I currently think there is likely to be more variation in cause effectiveness even after you filter to the ones which could plausibly be high value; however I am quite uncertain about this.</p>\n<p>There is also an asymmetry which pushes us towards doing more cause assessment first: it\u2019s much easier to cut down the work of evaluating leverage ratios by restricting to a few causes than it is to cut down the work of evaluating cause effectiveness by first identifying opportunities with high leverage ratios. Similarly, if we identify a cause area which is valuable but see no good interventions available to fund, <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/05/14/the-importance-of-committing-to-causes/\">we can advertise this and hopefully create good interventions in the area</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course to support giving decisions today we need to compare leverage ratios as well as cause effectiveness. And in some cases studying the interventions may help us to evaluate the cause effectiveness. But I think it will usually be right to investigate leverage ratios only within cause areas that we think have, or might have, high effectiveness, and only after we\u2019ve made an effort to assess that.</p>\n<p><small><em>Acknowledgements</em>: thanks to Toby Ord and Nick Beckstead for helpful conversations.</small></p>\n<p><small>Crossposted from the <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/factoring-cost-effectiveness/\">Global Priorities Project</a>.</small></p>\n<p><small> </small></p>\n<p><small>[1] The leverage ratio is really a function of <em>x</em> together with X. <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/Default.aspx\">AMF</a> may have one leverage ratio with respect to the area of global health, and another with respect to malaria treatment.</small></p>\n<p><small>[2] An extra advantage of breaking the comparisons into like-with-like is that it\u2019s easier to track uncertainty so that it doesn\u2019t blow up unnecessarily.

But it doesn\u2019t follow that C(X)/C(Y) could lie anywhere in (1/100, 100). If my uncertainty about X is related to my uncertainty about Y (say X is reducing carbon emissions and Y is helping communities adapt to climate change), then I might have a better idea of the ratio C(X)/C(Y) than I do about either individually. Of course this just means that my estimates for C(X) and C(Y) are strongly correlated. But I think it\u2019s helpful to have an idea of practical ways to break up the calculation which help to keep the uncertainty under control.

{"date": "9th Sep 2014", "title": "The Haste Consideration", "author": "Introduction", "num_comments": "2 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>by Matt Wage, originally on the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/04/the-haste-consideration/\">80,000 Hours Blog</a><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/04/the-haste-consideration/\"></a></em></p>\n<p>The haste consideration: resources for improving the world are vastly more valuable if you have those resources sooner.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll first explain one way to see that the haste consideration is true, and then I\u2019ll talk about one important implication of this consideration.</p>\n<p>People who dedicate a large part of their life to strategically doing as much good as possible - i.e. effective altruists - are able to accomplish vastly more good than most people will. Unfortunately, not many people are effective altruists.</p>\n<p>One way to try to improve the world would be to try to convince more people to be effective altruists. If you spent all of your efforts doing this, how long do you think it would take to convince one person who is at least as effective as you are at improving the world? For most people, if they\u2019re strategic about it, I think they could do it in less than\u00a0two<span>\u00a0</span>years.</p>\n<p>Now imagine two worlds:</p>\n<p>(1) You don\u2019t do anything altruistic for the next two<span>\u00a0</span>years and then you spend the rest of your life after that improving the world as much as you can.</p>\n<p>(2) You spend the next 2 years influencing people to become effective altruists and convince one person who is at least as effective as you are at improving the world. (And assume that this person wouldn't have done anything altruistic otherwise.) You do nothing altruistic after the next 2 years, but the person you convinced does at least as much good as you did in (1).</p>\n<p>By stipulation, world (2) is improved at least as much as world (1) is because, in (2), the person you convinced does at least as much good as you did in (1).</p>\n<p>Many people object to this. They think, \u201cIt\u2019s possible that world (1) could be improved more than world (2) is. For example, world (1) be better if, in that world, you convinced 10 people to be effective altruists who are at least as good as you.\u201d This is a natural thought, but remember that we are assuming that the person you convince in (2) is \u201cat least as good as you are at improving the world\u201d. This implies that if you convince 10 people in world (1), then the person you convinced in world (2) will do something at least as good as that. It\u2019s true by definition that world (2) is improved at least as much as world (1) is.</p>\n<p>There are two lessons we can take away from this. The first lesson is that influencing people to become effective altruists is a pretty high value strategy for improving the world. For any altruistic activity you\u2019re doing, it might be useful to ask yourself, \u201cDo I really think this will improve the world more than influencing would?\u201d</p>\n<p>The second lesson is that you can do more good with time in the present than you can with time in the future. If you spend the next\u00a0two<span>\u00a0</span>years doing something at least as good as influencing people to become effective altruists, then these\u00a0two<span>\u00a0</span>years will plausibly be more valuable than all of the rest of your life. In particular, these\u00a0two<span>\u00a0</span>years will be more valuable than any\u00a0two-year period in the future. This is one way to see that the haste consideration is true.</p>\n<p>One implication of the haste consideration: It\u2019s plausible that how you spend the next few years of your life is more important than how you spend your life after that. For this reason, when choosing a career, you should pay special attention to how each career would require you to spend the next few years. For example, if a career would require you to spend the next few years studying in school and doing nothing altruistic, then this is a major cost of that career.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Part of\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/\">Introduction to Effective Altruism</a>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Previous:\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/76/your_dollar_goes_further_overseas/\">Your Dollar Goes Further Overseas</a>\u00a0\u2022 Next:\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/50/preventing_human_extinction/\">Preventing Human Extinction</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/ea/50/preventing_human_extinction/\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/ea/50/preventing_human_extinction/\"></a></p></div></div>"},

All the people I had met in that building were interesting, smart, and quirky, so I expected that, no less. Compared to the other visitors to the appropriately named Haste street apartments, however, he seemed more focused and organized, which was not saying much. Within maybe fifteen minutes of conversation we mutually perceived a distinctive trait we shared, but others didn't. Everyone in that building was smart, everyone was altruistic, everyone wanted the world to improve, but both of us <em>had a plan</em>. Three hours later we shook hands and decided to work together.</p>\n<p>My plan and Geoff Anders' plan were at different levels of analysis, using different methodologies, different levels of abstraction. That was before Leverage Research or IERFH (Institute Ethics Rationality, and Future of Humanity) had their respective names, or even existed at all. Those plans, mine written, his in flowchart form, were the seeds of two institutions.</p>\n<p>Geoff used to say that the way he got people to work with him was basically by impressing The Plan upon them. It worked for me; I decided to dedicate 15+ hours of my week to what would become Leverage Research, even though my main quest was still to pursue my relative advantage - returning to Brazil to create my own institution there - It also worked for many of Leverage's initial members.</p>\n<p>Not long after that Wednesday, another planner arrived at the Haste apartments. Luke Muehlhauser, who would later become the CEO of MIRI. Though many different things have contributed to Luke's position, in particular blogging at commonsenseatheism.com, I perceive his continuous insistence on a <em>yearly plan</em> for MIRI as pivotal to his ascendance to CEO.</p>\n<p>Those were important days at the Haste apartments and they were important days because people were making plans. Plans that start with a box saying \"we are here\" and end with a box saying \"the World is significantly improved\".</p>\n<p>Another case study of having plans is that of Matt Fallshaw, a successful effective altruist who has created several successful companies, giving him substantial resources to direct to the causes he finds most important. Fallshaw is remarkable for his productivity. He sleeps for four hours a day, fasts daily and exercises by sprinting repetitively up a hill. When asked about productivity techniques, Fallshaw <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/kt9/productivity_thoughts_from_matt_fallshaw/\">described</a> basically techniques for making good failsafe accurate plans. His advice is: 1) Use a randomized spaced repetition system like anki to make sure you are successfully installing the habits that will cause you to execute your plan. 2) Make sure you have above average energy when making and reviewing plans. 3) If a goal seems impossible or intractable, use a 5-Minute timer (i.e. CFAR's Focused Grit) to try to a) solve the problem, or, failing that b) Generate a set of action sequence steps, each less than 5 minutes long, that will take you 80 or 100% of the way towards the goal. 4) Use a system for freeing attention, such as Getting Things Done. 5) Apply the principles of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints\">Theory of Constraints</a> to large plans.</p>\n<p>Finally, another successful founder of EA projects, Peter Thiel, has recently spend considerable effort in giving\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZM_JmZdqCw\">presentations</a> about and writing a <a href=\"http://libgen.org/search.php?req=peter+thiel+zero+to+one&amp;open=0&amp;view=simple&amp;phrase=1&amp;column=def\">book chapter</a> on the idea that <em>You are not a lottery ticket</em>. By that he means that trying to find a reference class to which you belong, and evaluating your chances of obtaining a particular outcome can only go so far. It is not just chance that brings new ideas - zero to one - to the world. Having a probabilistic view of the world, an indefinite view of the future, is dangerous - yes, this applies to you too, Bayesian startup creators. Let me illustrate this with some examples of actions you'd take:</p>\n<p>If you see the future as indefinite and optimistic, if whether you succeed or not depends on chance, then the best thing you can do is <em>improve your chances</em>. Since chances are imagined relative to a reference class, then you will feel incentivized to be in the right reference class. So entering Harvard will seem like a good place to seed a successful startup. Once you get in, the grass will be greener if you drop out. No reference class beats Harvard drop-outs right? If you are an investor, having a broad portfolio of stocks will also feel like a sound investment decision, since you \"know\" it\u2019s unwise to choose any definite thing, including stocks. That is not how the world works, according to your indefinite model. In an indefinite world, everyone outsources everything, no one takes responsibility and makes specific decisions, things stop being built, everyone fights for reference class hopping, and hopes that over the long run the dice will turn in their favor.</p>\n<p>Thiel contrasts this with a definite optimistic view of the future, which can be seen in Marx, Hegel, US policy from 1950 to 1960, and I'd argue also in his investment decisions, in planners like Anders, Luke Muehlhauser, Toby Ord, <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/jl3/on_saving_the_world/\">Nate Soares</a>, Thiel himself, and a minority of effective altruists. According to the definite view, it is worthwhile to have ideas, to seek opportunities, to find market failures, and to act on them. It is desirable to conceive of specific ways the world could be, and design plans to move us there. Thiel says this approach was more common in the 1940\u2019s:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bold plans were not reserved just for political leaders or government scientists. In the late 1940's a Californian named John Reber set out to reinvent the physical geography of the whole San Francisco Bay Area. Reber was a schoolteacher, an amateur theater producer, and a self-taught engineer. Undaunted by his lack of credentials, he publicly proposed to build two huge dams in the Bay, construct massive freshwater lakes for drinking water and irrigation, and reclaim 20,000 acres of land for development. Reber though he had no personal authority, people took the Reber Plan seriously. It was endorsed by newspaper editorial boards across California. The US congress held hearings on its feasibility. [...]</p>\n<p>But would anybody today take such a vision seriously in the first place? In the 1950's, people welcomed big plans and asked whether they would work. Today a grand plan coming from a schoolteacher would be dismissed as crankery, and a long-range vision coming from anyone more powerful would be derided as hubristic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can see two messages here:</p>\n<p>1) Having a definite view of the future has been a major driving force of few particularly productive people in the current effective altruist movement.</p>\n<p>2) Adopting a definite view of the future predicts success, and requires making specific action plans.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Secret_planning\">Secret planning</h2>\n<p>If you are convinced that having a definite vision of the future is a good idea, then you have two choices: create your own view of the future and make a plan to make it happen; or <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement?language=en\">adopt someone's</a> specific view of the future, and make it happen.</p>\n<p>These are the most important actions. Moving from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 2. Not unlike geometry, getting from 2 onwards is not only easier, it what everyone is already doing. If you are determining a line, the third point is one point too many. It is, in a word, redundant.</p>\n<p>If you adopt a plan that more than 0 or 1 people already have then you are incurring in a specific failure mode, you are zooming in at the wrong level of granularity. For instance, suppose you consider the creation of Friendly Artificial Intelligence to be the most important task. Well, so do Muehlhauser and Yudkowsky, therefore you should look elsewhere right? No. What you should look for are actions - steps instrumental to the creation of Friendly Artificial Intelligence that others are not looking into. As Thiel contends, this is very hard, it is unnatural to try new things. It is especially unsettling to look for failures in worldscale plans in part because, should you actually find an error, you may inherit responsibility for fixing it, it is now your responsibility to make it happen. You are the only person who knows the secret path, it is a necessary route to arrive at your goal, and if you don't go through it, no one will. Furthermore, others may not only fail to see the path, but be dismissive of it\u2019s importance. This is good indication that your planning lens are zooming in from the right distance - if everyone agrees with you, you are too far, if no one understands you, you are too near - when in between you may still be wrong, but in that zone fly the ideas Peter Thiel calls secrets, ideas that looks clearly bad, but happen to be actually good. That is the group of ideas Thiel seeks to fund, in case you are wondering. When you find a secret, you become irreplaceable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Plan_design\">Plan design</h2>\n<p>Now what would your plan look like?</p>\n<p>Your plan may be an <a href=\"http://yudkowsky.net/obsolete/singularity.html\">emotional grandiose vision</a> of what is to come. Yet that is suboptimal.<br>It may be <a href=\"http://intelligenceexplosion.com/\">a narrative</a>, with describes in linear fashion what needs to happen. Yet that is still suboptimal.<br>It may be a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxuYmVja3N0ZWFkfGd4OjExNDBjZTcwNjMxMzRmZGE\">call to arms</a>, so that people see the importance of what you have noticed. - We are getting hotter, but still not optimal.</p>\n<p>Remember Fallshaw's advice that using Theory of Constraints can help in designing your plan, it helps you predict time pressures, releasing valves before they constrain your ability to move. Furthermore, your plan must have parallel paths depending on how reality reacts to your actions, and so that actions can be done in parallel. Finally your plans must be understandable and communicable, which is how Geoff attracted the first researchers to Leverage.</p>\n<p>The optimal plan then , is, like <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxADVDGSaIVZNnppbG45NDIyU2M/edit\">Leverage's old plan</a>, a flowchart, or another clear <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxADVDGSaIVZbnlXdE5PNkhGQUU/view?usp=sharing\">structure</a> (my <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxADVDGSaIVZVmdCSE1tSktneFU/view?usp=sharing\">EA plan</a>) that permits parallel paths, hierarchization with different levels of granularity visible at particular times. A graph. I use <a href=\"http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Download\">Freemind</a> for ease of keyboard shortcuts, then Mindmup for different visualization, though it loses formatting and pictures.</p>\n<p>Maybe you think Geoff<sub>2011</sub> choose the wrong level of granularity to design a plan. Perhaps, but just having a plan allows much more thorough monitoring of what is going on, tractability of how well we are doing in relation to predictions, and specially pre-conceived reactions in case reality reacts in one or other particular way.</p>\n<p>Nick Bostrom's book Superintelligence doesn't create one causal story and run with it. It maps out many different ways in which reality can behave as it approaches an intelligence explosion. In unprecedented detail, it scrutinizes ways to steer the future so that reality's moves are, as much as possible, amenable to some level of control, before, during, and after an intelligence explosion. It is not a complete flowchart, but it is the best set of predictions and contingency plans we have so far regarding this particular cause.</p>\n<p>Superintelligence and Leverage's plan are good examples of what a plan should look like. An initial plan to personally act on the secret you discovered, however, will justifiably be simpler. We will return to that on the next post, for now, here is\u00a0<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxADVDGSaIVZNXoydFRManhwOEk/view?usp=sharing\">a template of a plan</a> without content so you can use it for your own EA plan. <a href=\"http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Download\">Freemind</a> has faster commands, Mindmup has more visual variety.</p>\n<p>Try things.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<hr>\n<h6><span><span>If anyone solved the problem of copying texts from google docs to here without losing some spaces,\u00a0bold\u00a0and\u00a0</span>italics<span>\u00a0when you\u00a0<a href=\"http://word2cleanhtml.com/cleanit\">clean it</a>\u00a0let me know<br></span></span></h6>\n<p><span>Thanks Ryan Carey for careful commenting and editing, Oliver and Nate for increasing the urges and urgency.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span><span><br></span></span></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "9th Sep 2014", "title": "Scope Insensitivity", "author": "Introduction", "num_comments": "5 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span><em>by Eliezer Yudkowsky, originally on <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hw/scope_insensitivity/\">LessWrong</a></em></span></p>\n<p>Once upon a time, three groups of subjects were asked how much they would pay to save 2000 / 20000 / 200000 migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The groups respectively answered $80, $78, and $88 [1]. This is\u00a0<em>scope insensitivity</em>\u00a0or\u00a0<em>scope neglect:</em>\u00a0the number of birds saved - the\u00a0<em>scope</em>\u00a0of the altruistic action - had little effect on willingness to pay.</p>\n<p>Similar experiments showed that Toronto residents would pay little more to clean up all polluted lakes in Ontario than polluted lakes in a particular region of Ontario [2], or that residents of four western US states would pay only 28% more to protect all 57 wilderness areas in those states than to protect a single area [3].</p>\n<p>People visualize \"a single exhausted bird, its feathers soaked in black oil, unable to escape\" [4]. This image, or\u00a0<em>prototype,</em>\u00a0calls forth some level of emotional arousal that is primarily responsible for willingness-to-pay - and the image is the same in all cases. As for scope, it gets tossed out the window - no human can visualize 2000 birds at once, let alone 200000. The usual finding is that\u00a0<em>exponential\u00a0</em>increases in scope create\u00a0<em>linear</em>\u00a0increases in willingness-to-pay - perhaps corresponding to the linear time for our eyes to glaze over the zeroes; this small amount of affect is added, not multiplied, with the prototype affect. This hypothesis is known as \"valuation by prototype\".</p>\n<p>An alternative hypothesis is \"purchase of moral satisfaction\". People spend enough money to create a\u00a0<em>warm glow</em>\u00a0in themselves, a sense of having done their duty. The level of spending needed to purchase a warm glow depends on personality and financial situation, but it certainly has nothing to do with the number of birds.</p>\n<p>We are insensitive to scope even when human lives are at stake: Increasing the alleged risk of chlorinated drinking water from 0.004 to 2.43 annual deaths per 1000 - a factor of 600 - increased willingness-to-pay from $3.78 to $15.23 [5]. Baron and Greene found no effect from varying lives saved by a factor of 10 [6].</p>\n<p>A paper entitled\u00a0<a href=\"http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/comm486-686/value%20of%20life.pdf\">Insensitivity to the value of human life: A study of psychophysical numbing</a>\u00a0collected evidence that our perception of human deaths follows Weber's Law - obeys a logarithmic scale where the \"just noticeable difference\" is a constant fraction of the whole. A proposed health program to save the lives of Rwandan refugees garnered far higher support when it promised to save 4,500 lives in a camp of 11,000 refugees, rather than 4,500 in a camp of 250,000. A potential disease cure had to promise to save far more lives in order to be judged worthy of funding, if the disease was originally stated to have killed 290,000 rather than 160,000 or 15,000 people per year. [7]</p>\n<p>The moral: If you want to be an effective altruist, you have to think it through with the part of your brain that processes those unexciting inky zeroes on paper, not just the part that gets real worked up about that poor struggling oil-soaked bird.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>[1] Desvousges, W.

{"date": "2nd Jun 2014", "title": "Human and animal interventions: the long-term view", "author": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt", "num_comments": "18 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>Crossposted from the <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/research/global-priorities-project/\">Global Priorities Project</a></em></p><p>This post discusses the question of how we should seek to compare human- and animal-welfare interventions. It argues: first, that indirect long-term effects mean that we cannot simply compare the short term welfare effects; second, that if any animal-welfare charities are comparably cost-effective with the best human-welfare charities, it must be because of their effect on humans, changing the behaviour of humans long into the future.</p><p>In the search for the most cost-effective interventions, one major area of debate is whether the evidence favours focussing on human or animal welfare.\u00a0<a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/vegan-outreach-cost-effectiveness-calculator/\">Some have argued for estimates</a>\u00a0showing animal welfare interventions to be much more cost-effective per unit of suffering averted, with an implication that animal welfare should perhaps therefore be prioritised. However this reasoning ignores a critical difference between the two types of intervention: the long-term impact. There are good arguments that\u00a0<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxuYmVja3N0ZWFkfGd4OjExNDBjZTcwNjMxMzRmZGE\">the long-term future has a large importance</a>, and that\u00a0<a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2014/05/04/we-can-probably-influence-the-far-future/\">we can expect to be able to influence it</a>.</p><p>The intention here is not to attack the cost-effectiveness estimates, which may well be entirely correct as far as they go. However, like most such assessments they only consider the immediate, direct impact of interventions and compare these against each other. For example, disease relief schemes would be compared by looking at the immediate welfare benefits to the humans or animals cured of disease.</p><p>What this process misses out is that interventions to improve human welfare have ongoing positive effects throughout society. It has been argued that healthy humans with access to education, food and clean water are far more likely to be productive, and contribute to the economic development of their society, with\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">knock-on improvements for everyone who comes after them</a>. Also, not having to worry about their basic needs may free them up to spend more time considering and improving the circumstances of others around them.</p><p>The upshot of this is that it is likely interventions in human welfare, as well as being immediately effective to relieve suffering and improve lives, also tend to have a significant long-term impact. This is often more difficult to measure, but the short-term impact can generally be used as a reasonable proxy.</p><p>By contrast, no analogous mechanism ensures that an improvement in the welfare of one animal results in the improvements in the welfare of other animals. This is primarily because animals lack societies, or at least the sort of societies capable of learning and economic development. Even though many animals are able to learn new skills, they are extremely limited in their ability to share this knowledge or even pass it on to their offspring.</p><p>The result is that short-term welfare benefits to animals cannot be used as even a rough proxy for long-term improvements in the same way as they can for humans. So even if the short-term estimates suggest that animal welfare interventions are more cost-effective, it is certainly questionable whether this aspect dominates when considering the overall benefits.</p><p>This does not, of course, rule out the possibility that the most effective interventions could have an animal welfare element. For example, a shift in society towards vegetarianism would reduce the number of animals kept in poor conditions today, as well as improving human welfare in numerous ways (such as using fertile land more efficiently to grow crops rather than cattle). Moreover, if it could achieve a lasting improvement in societal values, it might have a large benefit in improved animal welfare over the long-term.</p><p>A push towards vegetarianism is one sort of value-shifting intervention. It is possible that this or another such intervention could be more effective than direct improvements to human welfare, but in order to assess this we need to \u00a0to model how changing societal values today will influence the behaviour of future generations. This should be a target for further research.</p><p>Humans are uniquely placed to pass on the benefits of interventions to the rest of society and to future generations, and if we ignore these future-compounding effects we may achieve less good than we could have. For many types of human welfare intervention, we can use the short-term benefits to humans as a proxy for ongoing improvements in a way that is not possible - and may be misleading - when it comes to improvements to animal welfare. Although it is difficult to quantify, this hidden benefit may be enough to make the best human-focussed interventions more cost-effective than the best animal-focussed ones, even if the reverse seems true looking at the short run.</p></div></div>"},

But this uncertainty can also arise out of fundamental normative uncertainty: out of not knowing, for example, what moral weight the wellbeing of distant strangers has compared to the wellbeing of our family; or whether non-human animals are worthy of moral concern even given knowledge of all the facts about their biology and psychology.<p></p><p>\u2026one might have expected philosophers to have devoted considerable research time to the question of how one ought to take one\u2019s normative uncertainty into account in one\u2019s decisions. But the issue has been largely neglected. This thesis attempts to begin to fill this gap.</p></blockquote>\nIn the first part of your thesis you argue that when the moral theories to which an agent assigns some credence are cardinally measurable (as opposed to ordinal-scale) <i>and</i> they are intertheoretically comparable, the agent should choose an action which \u201cmaximizes expected choice-worthiness\u201d (MEC), which is akin to maximizing expected value across multiple uncertain theories of what is desirable.<p></p><p>I suspect that result will be intuitive to many, so let\u2019s jump forward to where things get more interesting. You write:\n</p><blockquote>Sometimes, [value] theories are merely ordinal, and, sometimes, even when theories are cardinal, choice-worthiness is not comparable between them. In either of these situations, MEC cannot be applied. In light of this problem, I propose that the correct metanormative theory is sensitive to the different sorts of information that different theories provide. In chapter 2, I consider how to take normative uncertainty into account in conditions where all theories provide merely ordinal choice-worthiness, and where choice-worthiness is noncomparable between theories, arguing in favour of the <i>Borda Rule</i>.</blockquote>\nWhat is the Borda Rule, and why do you think it\u2019s the best action rule under these conditions?<p></p><p></p><p><strong>Will MacAskill</strong>: Re: \u201cI suspect that result will be intuitive to many.\u201d Maybe in your circles that\u2019s true! Many, or even most, philosophers get off the boat way before this point. They say that there\u2019s no sense of \u2018ought\u2019 according to which what one ought to do takes normative uncertainty into account. I\u2019m glad that I don\u2019t have to defend that for you, though, as I think it\u2019s perfectly obvious that the \u2018no ought\u2019 position is silly.</p><p>As for the Borda Rule: the Borda Rule is a type of voting system, which works as follows. For each theory, an option\u2019s <i>Borda Score</i> is equal to the number of options that rank lower in the theory\u2019s choice-worthiness ordering than that option. An option\u2019s <i>Credence-Weighted Borda Score</i> is equal to the sum, across all theories, of the decision-maker\u2019s credence in the theory multiplied by the Borda Score of the option, on that theory.</p><p>So, for example, suppose I have 80% credence in Kantianism and 20% credence in Contractualism. (Suppose I\u2019ve had some very misleading evidence\u2026.) Kantianism says that option A is the best option, then option B, then option C. Contractualism says that option C is the best option, then option B, then option A.</p><p>The Borda scores, on Kantianism, are:</p><p>A = 2</p><p>B = 1</p><p>C = 0</p><p>The Borda scores, on Contractualism, are:</p><p>A = 0</p><p>B = 1</p><p>C = 2</p><p>Each option\u2019s Credence-Weighted Borda Score is:</p><p>A = 0.8*2 + 0.2*0 = 1.6</p><p>B = 0.8*1 + 0.2*1 = 1</p><p>C = 0.8*0 + 0.2*2 = 0.4</p><p>So, in this case, the Borda Rule would say that A is the most appropriate option, followed by B, and then C.</p><p>The reason we need to use some sort of voting system is because I\u2019m considering, at this point, only <i>ordinal</i> theories: theories that tell you that it\u2019s better to choose A over B (alt: that \u201cA is more choice-worthy than B\u201d), but won\u2019t tell you <i>how much</i> more choice-worthy A is than B. So, in these conditions, we have to have a theory of how to take normative uncertainty into account that\u2019s sensitive <i>only</i> to each theory\u2019s choice-worthiness ordering (as well as the degree of credence in each theory), because the theories I\u2019m considering don\u2019t give you anything more than an ordering.</p><p>The key reason why I think the Borda Rule is better than any other voting system is that it satisfies a condition I call Updating Consistency. The idea is that increasing your credence in some particular theory T1 shouldn\u2019t make the appropriateness ordering (that is, the ordering of options in terms of what-you-ought-to-do-under-<wbr>normative-uncertainty) <i>worse</i> by the lights of T1.</wbr></p><p>This condition seems to me to be <i>very plausible indeed</i>. But, surprisingly, very few voting systems satisfy that property, and those others that do have other problems.</p><p><span></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Luke</strong>: One problem for the Borda Rule is that it is, as you say, \u201cextremely sensitive to how one individuates options\u201d \u2014 a problem analogous to the problem of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_clones_criterion\">clone-dependence</a> in voting theory. You tackle this problem by modifying the Borda Rule to include a measure over the set of all possible options. Could you explain how that works? Also, is this modification to the Borda Rule novel to your thesis?</p><p></p><p><strong>Will</strong>: A measure is a way of giving sense to the size of a space. It allows us to say that some options represent a larger part of possibility space than others. This is an intuitive idea: \u2018drinking tea tomorrow\u2019 represents a larger portion of possibility space than \u2018drinking tea with my left hand tomorrow at 3pm\u2019. With the idea of a measure on board, we can rewrite our definition of the Borda Rule, as follows (I\u2019ll ignore the possibility of equally choice-worthy options, as that makes the definition a little more complicated):</p><p>For each theory, an option\u2019s <i>Borda Score</i> is equal to the sum total of the measure of the options that rank lower in the theory\u2019s choice-worthiness ordering than that option. An option\u2019s <i>Credence-Weighted Borda Score</i> is equal to the sum, across all theories, of the decision-maker\u2019s credence in the theory multiplied by the Borda Score of the option, on that theory.</p><p>So, suppose that, according to some theory Ti, A&gt;B. On the old definition of the Borda Rule, A gets a Borda Score of 1. But if option B is split into options B\u2019 and B\u201d, such that A&gt;B\u2019=B\u201d, then A gets a Borda score of 2. The fact that A\u2019s score has changed just because of how you\u2019ve individuated options is problematic.</p><p>But let\u2019s use the new definition, which incorporates a measure, and suppose that the measure of A is 0.5 and the measure of B is 0.5. If so, then, when the decision-maker faces options A and B, then A gets a Borda Score of 0.5, on Ti. But when option B is split into options B\u2019 and B\u201d, then the measure is split, too. Suppose that B\u2019 and B\u201d are equally large. If so, then B\u2019 would have a measure of 0.25 and B\u201d would have a measure of 0.25. So A\u2019s Borda score, on Ti, would be 0.5, just as before.</p><p>This modification to the Borda Rule is novel, though the idea was given to me by Owen Cotton-Barratt, so I can\u2019t take credit! I guess the reason it hasn\u2019t been suggested in the voting theory literature is because it might seem obvious that every candidate gets the same measure. But perhaps you could think of the \u2018space\u2019 of possible political positions (which would be easy if it were really a left-right spectrum), and assign candidates a measure based on how much of this space they take up. That could possibly allow for the Borda Rule to avoid problems to do with clone-dependence. But I think that for actual voting systems, the Schulze method is better than the Borda Rule. It\u2019s clone-independent even without a measure, and is much less vulnerable to strategic voting than the Borda Rule is.</p><p></p><p><strong>Luke</strong>: What is the relevance of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem\">Arrow\u2019s impossibility theorem</a> to your suggested use of a modified Borda Rule for handling normative uncertainty?</p><p></p><p><strong>Will</strong>: I suggest that, in conditions of ordinal theories, we should exploit the analogy with voting. But that analogy with voting means that we\u2019ll run into a analogue of Arrow\u2019s Impossibility Theorem: the result that no voting system can satisfy all of a number of highly desirable properties.</p><p>There are a few ways to formulate the impossibility result. The strongest, in my view, is to say that any voting system that satisfies other more essential properties must violate Contraction Consistency, where Contraction Consistency is defined as follows:</p><p>Let A be the option set, and M be the set of maximally appropriate options within A. Let S be a subset of A that contains all members of M. The condition is: <i>A</i> is a maximally appropriate option, given option set S, iff it is a member of M.</p><p>It\u2019s a condition that you\u2019ve got to be careful how to formulate. I don\u2019t go into that in my thesis. But some violations of it are intuitively clearly irrational. E.g. imagine you\u2019ve got the options of blueberry ice cream or strawberry ice cream. You currently prefer blueberry. But then you discover that the restaurant also serves chocolate ice cream, and so you switch your preference from blueberry to strawberry, even though your assessment of the relative values of blueberry and strawberry hasn\u2019t changed. That seems irrational \u2013 e.g. it would suggest that you should spend resources trying to find out if you have available to you an option that you know you won\u2019t take.</p><p>I think that contraction consistency is a problem for the Borda Rule. But it\u2019s a problem that affects all voting system analogues. So it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve got to live with \u2013 it\u2019s just unfortunate that we have (or ought to have) credence in merely ordinal theories.</p><p>There is a second response as well. Which is to distinguish the Narrow and Broad versions of the Borda Rule. The Narrow version assigns Borda Scores within an option-set. The Broad version assigns Borda Scores across all possible options. It\u2019s only the Narrow version that violates Contraction Consistency. But the Broad version has its own weirdnesses. Suppose that you\u2019ve got a situation:</p><p>99%: T1: A&gt;B</p><p>1%: T2: B&gt;A</p><p>Where T1 and T2 are merely ordinal theories. It might seem obvious that you should pick A in that situation. But you can\u2019t infer that from that case, according to the Broad Borda Rule. Instead, you\u2019ve got to look at how A and B rank in T1 and T2\u2032s ordering of all possible options. If A and B are very close on T1 but very far apart, on T2, then B might be the most appropriate option. So the Broad Borda is very difficult to use. And it gives results that seem wrong to me \u2013 as if you\u2019re \u2018faking\u2019 cardinality where there is none.</p><p>So my general view on this is that any account you have will have deep problems. Endorsing a particular view involves carefully weighing up different strengths and weaknesses; there\u2019s no obviously correct position. (This becomes a theme when you start working on normative uncertainty. To an extent, this should be expected: we\u2019re dealing with messy nonideal agents, who don\u2019t have perfect access to their own values or to the normative truth).</p><p></p><p><strong>Luke</strong>: Your thesis covers many other interesting topics; we won\u2019t try to cover them all here. How would you summarize the other major \u201ctakeaways\u201d you\u2019d most want people to know about from your thesis?</p><p></p><p><strong>Will</strong>: The \u201cMaximise Expected Choice-Worthiness\u201d approach to moral uncertainty is the best approach. It is able to respond to a number of objections that have been levelled against it.</p><p>If you think that you can\u2019t compare choice-worthiness across theories, then you should normalise different theories at their variance. But I think that the arguments for intertheoretic incomparability don\u2019t work. Instead, you should feel comfortable about using your intuitions about how different theories compare.</p><p>We can make sense of the idea of two theories T1 and T2 having exactly the value-ordering over options, but T1 thinking that everything is twice as important as T2 does. So \u2018utilitarianism\u2019 really refers to a class of theories, each of different levels of amplification.</p><p>Most of our intuitions about different Newcomb and related problems can be captured by maximising expected choice-worthiness over uncertainty about whether evidential or causal decision theory is true (with much higher credence in causal decision-theory than evidential decision theory). Taking decision-theoretic uncertainty into account puts causal decision theory on pretty strong grounds \u2014 you can respond to the intuitive and \u201cWhy Ain\u2019cha Rich?\u201d arguments in favour of evidential decision theory.</p><p>Moral philosophy provides a bargain in terms of gaining new information: doing just a bit of philosophical study or research can radically alter the value of one\u2019s options. So individuals, philanthropists, and governments should all spend a lot more resources on researching and studying ethics than they currently do.</p><p>Even if you think that continued human survival is net bad, you should still work to prevent near-term human extinction, in case the human race gets evidence to the contrary over the next few centuries. (Well, this is true given a few fairly controversial premises.</p><p></p><p><strong>Luke</strong>: Thanks, Will!</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "24th Dec 2014", "title": "MIRI posts its technical research agenda [link]", "author": "RyanCarey", "num_comments": "1 comment", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Today, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute posted its <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf\">technical research agenda</a>, written by Benja Fallenstein and Nate Soares.</p>\n<p>Here is the introduction. The paper is written predominantly for a technical audience, including AI scientists. But from an effective altruist point of view, section 5 may be worth a read.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>The characteristic that has enabled humanity to shape the world is not strength, not speed, but intelligence. Barring catastrophe, it seems clear that progress in AI will one day lead to the creation of agents meeting or exceeding human-level general intelligence, and this will likely lead to the eventual development of systems which are \"superintelligent'' in the sense of being \"smarter than the best human brains in practically every field\" (Bostrom 2014). A superintelligent system could have an enormous impact upon humanity: just as human intelligence has allowed the development of tools and strategies that let humans control the environment to an unprecedented degree, a superintelligent system would likely be capable of developing tools and strategies that give it extraordinary power (Muehlhauser and Salamon 2012). In light of this potential, it is essential to use caution when developing artificially intelligent systems capable of attaining or creating superintelligence.</span></p>\n<p>There is no reason to expect artificial agents to be driven by human motivations such as lust for power, but almost all goals can be better met with more resources (Omohundro 2008). This suggests that, by default, superintelligent agents would have incentives to acquire resources currently being used by humanity. (Can't we share? Likely not: there is no reason to expect artificial agents to be driven by human motivations such as fairness, compassion, or conservatism.) Thus, most goals would put the agent at odds with human interests, giving it incentives to deceive or manipulate its human operators and resist interventions designed to change or debug its behavior (Bostrom 2014, chap. 8).</p>\n<p>Care must be taken to avoid constructing systems that exhibit this default behavior. In order to ensure that the development of smarter-than-human intelligence has a positive impact on humanity, we must meet three formidable challenges: How can we create an agent that will reliably pursue the goals it is given? How can we formally specify beneficial goals? And how can we ensure that this agent will assist and cooperate with its programmers as they improve its design, given that mistakes in the initial version are inevitable?</p>\n<p>This agenda discusses technical research that is tractable today, which the authors think will make it easier to confront these three challenges in the future. Sections 2 through 4 motivate and discuss six research topics that we think are relevant to these challenges. Section 5 discusses our reasons for selecting these six areas in particular.</p>\n<p>We call a smarter-than-human system that reliably pursues beneficial goals \"aligned with human interests\" or simply \"aligned.\" To become confident that an agent is aligned in this way, a practical implementation that merely\u00a0<em>seems</em>\u00a0to meet the challenges outlined above will not suffice. It is also necessary to gain a solid theoretical understanding of why that confidence is justified. This technical agenda argues that there is foundational research approachable today that will make it easier to develop aligned systems in the future, and describes ongoing work on some of these problems.</p>\n<p>Of the three challenges, the one giving rise to the largest number of currently tractable research questions is the challenge of finding an agent architecture that will reliably pursue the goals it is given\u2014that is, an architecture which is alignable in the first place. This requires theoretical knowledge of how to design agents which reason well and behave as intended even in situations never envisioned by the programmers. The problem of highly reliable agent designs is discussed in Section 2.</p>\n<p>The challenge of developing agent designs which are tolerant of human error has also yielded a number of tractable problems. We argue that smarter-than-human systems would by default have incentives to manipulate and deceive the human operators. Therefore, special care must be taken to develop agent architectures which avert these incentives and are otherwise tolerant of programmer error. This problem and some related open questions are discussed in Section 3.</p>\n<p>Reliable, error-tolerant agent designs are only beneficial if they are aligned with human interests. The difficulty of concretely specifying what is meant by \"beneficial behavior\" implies a need for some way to construct agents that reliably<em>learn</em>\u00a0what to value (Bostrom 2014, chap. 12). A solution to this \"value learning'' problem is vital; attempts to start making progress are reviewed in Section 4.</p>\n<p>Why these problems? Why now? Section 5 answers these questions and others. In short, the authors believe that there is theoretical research which can be done today that will make it easier to design aligned smarter-than-human systems in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Further discussion on <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lfc/miris_technical_research_agenda/\">LessWrong</a></p></div></div>"},

{"date": "24th Nov 2014", "title": "Expected value estimates you can take (somewhat) literally", "author": "Gregory_Lewis", "num_comments": "24 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><h1 id=\"Summary\">Summary</h1>\n<p>A geometric interpretation of tail divergence offers a pseudo-robust mechanism of quantifying the expected 'regression to the mean' of a cost effectiveness estimate (i.e. expected value\u00a0<em>given</em>\u00a0estimated value). With caveats, this seems to be superior to current attempts at guestimation and 'calling the bottom' of anticipated regression to the mean. There are a few pleasing corollaries: 1) it vindicates a 'regressive mindset' (particularly championed by Givewell), and underscores the value of performing research to achieve more accurate estimation; 2) it suggests (and provides a framework for quantification for) how much an estimated expected value should be discounted by how speculative it is; 3) it suggests empirical approaches one can use to better quantify degree of regression, using variance in expected-value estimates.</p>\n<p>[Cross-posted <a href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/2014/11/expected-value-estimates-you-can-take-somewhat-literally/\">here</a>. I'm deeply uncertain about this, and wonder if this is an over-long elaboration on a very simple error. If so, please show me!]</p>\n<h1 id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</h1>\n<p>Estimates of expected value regress to the mean - something that seems much more valuable than average will generally look not-quite-so-valuable when one has a better look. This problem is particularly acute for effective altruism and its focus on the highest expected value causes, as these are likely to regress the most. Quantifying how much one expects an estimate to regress is not straightforward, and this has in part lead to groups like\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/\">Givewell warning against explicit expected value estimates</a>. More robust estimation has obvious value, especially when comparing between diverse cause areas, but worries about significant and differential over-estimation make these enterprises highly speculative.</p>\n<p>'In practice', I have seen people offer discounts to try and account for this effect (e.g. \"Givewell think AMF averts a DALY for $45-ish, so lets say it's $60 to try and account for this\"), or mention it as a caveat without quantification. It remains very hard to get an intuitive handle on how big one should expect this effect to be, especially when looking at different causes: one might expect more speculative causes in fields like animal welfare or global catastrophic risks to 'regress more' than relatively well-studied ones in public health, but how much more?</p>\n<p>I am unaware of any previous attempts to directly quantify this effect. I hope this essay can make some headway on this issue, and thus allow more trustworthy expected value estimates.<a></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"A_geometric_explanation_of_regression_to_the_mean\">A geometric explanation of regression to the mean</h1>\n<p>(A related post\u00a0<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/km6/why_the_tails_come_apart/\">here</a>)</p>\n<p>Why is there regression to the mean for expected value calculations? For a toy model, pretend there are some well-behaved normally distributed estimates of expected value, and the estimation technique that it captures 90% of the variance in expected value. A stylized scatter plot might look something like this, with a fairly tight ellipse covering the points.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/actualexpected.png\"><img src=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/actualexpected.png\" alt=\"actualexpected\"></a></p>\n<p>Despite the estimates of expected value being closely correlated to the actual expected values, there remains some scatter, and so the tails come apart: the estimated-to-be highest expected value things are unlikely to have the highest actual expected value (although it should still be pretty high). The better the estimate, the tighter the correlation, and therefore the tails diverge less:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/estimateregression.png\"><img src=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/estimateregression.png\" alt=\"estimateregression\"></a></p>\n<p>Another way of representing what is going on is using two vectors instead of Cartesian coordinates. If the set of estimates and actual expected values were plotted as vectors in n-dimensional space (normalized to a mean of zero), the cosine between them would be equal to the r-squared of their correlation. [1] \u00a0So our estimates correlated to the actual cost effectiveness values with an r-square of 0.9 looks like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/angles2.png\"><img src=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/angles2.png\" alt=\"angles2\"></a></p>\n<p>The two vectors lie in a similar direction to one another, as the arccos of 0.9 is ~26 degrees, (in accord with intuition, an r-square of 1 - perfect correlation - leads to vectors parallel, an r-square of zero vectors orthogonal, and and r-square of -1 vectors antiparallel). It also supplies a way to see how one can estimate the 'real' expected value given an estimated expected value - just project the expected value vector onto the 'actual' value vector, and the rest is basic trigonometry: multiply the hypotenuse (the estimate) by the cosine of the angle (the r-square) to arrive at the actual value. So, in our toy model with an R-square of 0.9, an estimate which is 1SD above the mean estimate puts the expected value at 0.9SD above the mean expected value.</p>\n<p>There are further dividends to this conceptualization: it helps explain why regression to mean happens across the entire range, but it is particularly noticeable at the tails: the absolute amount of regression to the mean (taken as estimate minus actual value given estimate) grows linearly with the size of the estimate. [2] Reassuringly, it is order preserving: although E &gt; A|E if E is above the mean, A|E1 &gt; A|E2 if E1&gt;E2, and so among a set of estimates of expected value, the highest estimate has the highest expected value.</p>\n<p>Given this fairly neat way of getting from an estimate to the expected value given an estimate, can this be exploited to give estimates that 'pre-empt' their own regression?</p>\n<h1 id=\"A_quick_and_fairly_dirty_attempt_at__regression_proofing__an_estimate\">A quick and fairly dirty attempt at 'regression-proofing' an estimate</h1>\n<p>A natural approach would be to try and estimate the expected value given an estimate by correcting for the correlation between the estimated expected value and the actual expected value. Although the geometry above was neat, there are several obstacles in the way of application to 'real' cost-effectiveness estimates. In ascending order of difficulty:</p>\n<p>1) The variances of the two distributions need to be standardized.</p>\n<p><em>Less of a big deal, we we'd generally hope for and aim that our estimates of expected value are drawn from a similar distribution to the actual expected values - if it's not, our estimates are systemically wrong somehow.</em></p>\n<p>2) We need to know the means of the distribution to do the standardization - after all, if an intervention was estimated to be\u00a0<em>below</em>\u00a0the mean, we should anticipate it to regress\u00a0<em>upwards</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Trickier for an EA context, as the groups that do evaluation focus their efforts on what appear to be the most promising things, so there isn't a clear handle on the 'mean global health intervention' which may be our distribution of interest. To some extent though, this problem solves itself if the underlying distributions of interest are log normal or similarly fat tailed and you are confident your estimate lies far from the mean (whatever it is): log (X - something small) approximates to log(X)</em></p>\n<p>\u00a03) Estimate errors should be at-least-vaguely symmetrical.</p>\n<p><em>If you expect your estimates to be systematically 'off', this sort of correction has limited utility. That said, perhaps this is not as burdensome as it first appears: although we should expect our estimates (especially in more speculative fields) to be prone to systematic error, this can be modelled as\u00a0symmetrical\u00a0error if we are genuinely uncertain of what sign the systematic error\u00a0should be. And, if you expect your estimate to be systematically erring one way or another, why haven't you revised it accordingly?</em></p>\n<p>4) How do you know the r-square between your estimates and their true values?</p>\n<p>\u00a0<em>Generally, these will remain hard to estimate, especially so for more speculative causes, as the true expected values will depend on recondite issues in the speculative cause itself. Further, I don't think many of us have a good 'handle' on what an r-square = 0.9 distribution looks like compared to an r-square of 0.5, and our adjustments (especially in fat-tailed distributions) will be highly sensitive to it. However, there is scope for improvement - one can use various approaches of benchmarking (if you think your estimator has an r-square of 0.9, you could ask yourself whether you think it\u00a0</em>really\u00a0<em>should track 90% of the variance in expected value, and one could gain a better 'feel' for the strength of various correlations by seeing some representative examples, and then use these to anchor an intuition about where the estimator should fall compared to these). Also, at least in cases with more estimates available, there would be pseudo-formal approaches to estimating the relevant angle between estimated and actual expected value (on which more later).</em></p>\n<p>5) What's the underlying distribution?</p>\n<p><em>Without many estimates, this is hard, and there is a risk of devolving into reference class tennis with different offers as to what underlying distributions 'should' be (broadly, fat tailed distributions with low means 'hurt' an estimate more, and vice-versa). This problem gets particularly acute when looking between cause areas, necessitating some shared distribution of actual expected values. I don't have any particularly good answers to offer here. Ideas welcome!</em></p>\n<p>With all these caveats duly caveated, let's have a stab at estimating the 'real' expected value of malaria nets, given Givewell's estimate: [3]</p>\n<ol>\n<li>(One of) Givewell's old estimates for malaria nets\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/Interventions/Nets/Cost-effectiveness%20analysis%20for%20LLIN%20distribution%20updated%20for%202013%20final.xls\">was $45 dollars per DALY averted</a>. This rate is the 'wrong way around', as we are interested in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2012-12-21/the-daly-illusion-part-i-comparing-improvements\">Unit/Cost rather than Cost/Unit</a>. So convert it to something like 'DALYs averted per $100000':\u00a0<strong>2222 DALYs/100000$\u00a0</strong>[4]\u00a0</li>\n<li>I aver (and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/protocol.pdf\">others</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2012-10-27/estimating-the-effectiveness-of-dcp\">agree</a>) that developing world interventions are approximately log-normally distributed, with a correspondingly fat tail to the right. [5]\u00a0So take logs to get to normality:\u00a0<strong>3.347</strong></li>\n<li>I think pretty highly of givewell, and so I rate their estimates pretty highly too. I think their estimation captures around 90% of the variance in actual expected value, so they correlate with an R-square of 0.9. So multiply by this factor:<strong>\u00a03.012</strong>.</li>\n<li>Then we do everything in reverse, so the 'revised' expected value estimate is\u00a0<strong>1028 DALYs/100000$</strong>, or back in the headline figure,\u00a0<strong>$97 dollars per DALY averted</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"Some_middling_reflections\">Some middling reflections</h1>\n<p>Naturally, this 'attempt' is far from rigorous, and it may take intolerable technical liberties. That said, I 'buy' this bottom line estimate more than my previous attempts to guestimate the 'post regression' cost effectiveness: I had previously been worried I was being too optimistic, whereas now my fears about my estimate are equal and opposite: I wouldn't be surprised if this was too optimistic, but I'd be similarly unsurprised if I was too pessimistic either.</p>\n<p>It also has some salutary lessons attached: the correction turns out be\u00a0<em>greater than a factor of two</em>, even when you think the estimate is really good. This vindicates my fear we are prone to under-estimate the risk, and how strongly regression can bite on the right of a fat-tailed distribution.</p>\n<p>The 'post regression' estimate of expected value depends a lot on the r-square - the 'angle' between the two vectors (e.g., if you thought Givewell were 'only' as good as a 0.8 correlation to real effect, then the revised estimate becomes\u00a0<strong>$210 per DALY averted</strong>). It is unfortunate to have an estimation method sensitive to a variable that is hard for us to grasp. It suggests that although our central measure for expected value may be $97/DALY, this should have wide credence bounds.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Comparing_estimates_of_differing_quality\">Comparing estimates of differing quality</h1>\n<p>One may be more interested not in the absolute expected value of a something, but how it compares to something else. This problem gets harder when comparing across diverse cause areas: one intuition may be that a more speculative estimate should be discounted when 'up against' a more robust estimate when comparing two causes or two interventions. A common venue I see this is comparing interventions between human and animal welfare. A common line of argument is something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For $1000 you might buy 20 or so QALYs, or maybe save a life (though that is optimistic) if you gave to AMF, in comparison, our best guess for an animal charity like The Humane League is it\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/the-humane-league/\">might save 3400 animals from a life in agriculture</a>. Isn't that even better?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bracketing all the considerable uncertainties of the right 'trade off' between animal and human welfare, anti- or pro-natalist concerns, trying to cash out 'a life in agriculture' in QALY terms, etc. etc. there's an underlying worry that ACE's estimate will be more speculative than Givewell's, and so their bottom line figures should be adjusted downwards compared to Givewell's as they have 'further to regress'. I think this is correct:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/speculativeness.png\"><img src=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/speculativeness.png\" alt=\"speculativeness\"></a></p>\n<p>Suppose there's a more speculative source of expected value estimates, and you want to compare these to your current batch of higher quality expected value estimates. Say you think the speculative estimates correlate to real expected value with an r-square of 0.4 - they leave most of the variance unaccounted for. Geometrically, this means your estimates and 'actual' value diverge quite a lot - the angle is around 66 degrees, and as a consequence you expected value given the estimate is significantly discounted. This can mean an intervention with a high (but speculative) estimate still has a lower expected value than an intervention with a lower but more reliable estimate. (Plotted above: E2 &gt; E1, but A2|E2 &lt; A1|E1)</p>\n<p>This correction wouldn't be a big deal (it's only going to be within an order of magnitude) except that we generally think the distributions are fat tailed and so these vectors are on something like a log scale. Going back to the previous case, if you thought that Animal Charity Evaluators estimates were 'only' correlated to real effects to a R-square of 0.4, your 'post regression' estimate as to how good The Humane League should be around\u00a0<strong>25 Animals saved per $1000 dollars</strong>, a reduction by\u00a0<em>two orders of magnitude</em>.</p>\n<p>Another fast and loose example would be something like this: suppose you are considering donating to a non-profit that wants to build a friendly AI. You estimate looks like it would be very good, but you know it is highly speculative, so estimates about its valuable might only be very weakly correlated with the truth (maybe R-square 0.1). How would it stack up to the AMF estimate made earlier? If you take Givewell to correlate much better to the truth (r-square 0.9, as earlier), then you can run the mathematics in reverse to see how 'good' your estimate of the AI charity has to be to still 'beat' Givewell's top charity after regression. The estimate for the friendly AI charity would need to be something greater than\u00a0<strong>10^25 DALYs averted per dollar donated\u00a0</strong>for you to believe it a 'better deal' than AMF - at least when Givewell were still recommending it. [6]</p>\n<h1 id=\"A_vindication_of_the_regressive_mindset\">A vindication of the regressive mindset</h1>\n<p>Given the above, regression to the mean, particularly on the sort of distributions Effective Altruists are dealing with, looks significant. If you are like me, you might be surprised at how large the downward adjustment is, and how much bigger it gets as your means of estimation get more speculative.</p>\n<p>This vindicates the '<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-08-22/a-conversation-with-holden-karnofsky-co-founder-of-givewell-part-i\">regressive mindset</a>', championed most prominently by Givewell: not only should we not take impressive sounding expected value estimates literally, we often should adjust them downwards by\u00a0<em>orders of magnitude</em>. [7] Insofar as you are surprised by the size of correction required in anticipation of regression to the mean, you should be less confident of more speculative causes (in a manner commensurate with their speculativeness), you should place a greater emphasis on robustness and reliability of estimation, and you should be more bullish about the value of cause prioritization research: improving the correlation of our estimates with actuality can massively increase the expected value of the best causes or interventions subsequently identified. [8] Givewell seem 'ahead of the curve', here, for which they deserve significant credit: much of this post can be taken as a more mathematical recapitulation of principles they already espouse. [9]</p>\n<h1 id=\"Towards_more_effective_cost_effectiveness_estimates\">Towards more effective cost-effectiveness estimates</h1>\n<p>These methods are not without problems: principally, a lot depends on estimate of the correlation, and estimating this is difficult and could easily serve as a fig leaf to cover prior prejudice (e.g. I like animals but dislike far future causes, so I'm bullish on how good we are at animal cause evaluation but talk down our ability to estimate far future causes, possibly giving orders of magnitude of advantage to my pet causes over others). Pseudo-rigorous methods can supply us a false sense of security, both in our estimates, but also in our estimation of our own abilities.</p>\n<p>In this case I believe the dividends outweigh the costs. It underscores how big an effect regression to the mean can be, and (if you are anything like me) prompts you to be more pessimistic when confronted with promising estimates. It appears to offer a more robust framework to allow our intuitions on these recondite matters to approach reflective equilibrium, and to better entrain them to the external world: the r-squares I offered in the examples above are in fact my own estimates, and on realizing their ramifications I my outlook on animal and targeted far future interventions has gone downwards, but my estimate of research has gone up. [10] If you disagree with me, we could perhaps point to a more precise source of our disagreement (maybe I over-egg how good Givewell is, but under-egg groups like ACE), and although much of our judgement of these matters would still rely on intuitive judgement calls, there's greater access for data to change our minds (maybe you could show me some representative associations with an r-square of 0.9 and 0.4 respectively, and suggest these are too strong/too weak to be analogous to the performance of Givewell and ACE). Prior to the mathematics, it is not clear what we could appeal to if you held that ACE should 'regress down' by ~10% and I held it should regress down by &gt;90%. [11]</p>\n<p>Besides looking for 'analogous data' (quantitative records of prediction of various bodies would be an obvious - and useful! - place to start) there are well-worn frequentist methods to estimate error that could be applied here, albeit with caveats: if there were multiple independent estimates of the same family of interventions, the correlation between them could be used to predict the correlation between them (or their mean) and the 'true' effect sizes (perhaps the 'repeat' of the Disease Control and Prevention Priorties project may provide such an opportunity, although I'd guess they wouldn't be truly independent, nor what they are estimating would be truly stationary). Similarly, but with greater difficulty, one could try and look at the track record of how far your estimates have previously regressed to anticipate how much ones in the future will. Perhaps these could be fertile avenues for further research. More qualitatively, it speaks in favour of multiple independent approaches to estimation, and so supports\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/06/10/sequence-thinking-vs-cluster-thinking/\">'cluster-esque'</a>\u00a0thinking approaches.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>[1] See\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.the-idea-shop.com/article/221/a-more-elegant-view-of-the-correlation-coefficient\">here</a>, or\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/06/17/covariance-and-law-of-cosines/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>[2] Again, recall that this with the means taken as zero - consequently, estimates below the mean will regress\u00a0<em>upwards.</em></p>\n<p>[3] Given Givewell's\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/26/change-in-against-malaria-foundation-recommendation-status-room-for-more-funding-related/\">move away from recommending AMF</a>, this 'real' expected value might be more like 'expected value a few years ago', depending on how much you agree with their reasoning.</p>\n<p>[4] It is worth picking a big multiple, as it gets fiddly dealing with logs that are negative.</p>\n<p>[5] There are further lines of supporting evidence: it looks like the factors that contribute to effectiveness multiply rather than add, and correspondingly\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/09/29/errors-in-dcp2-cost-effectiveness-estimate-for-deworming/\">errors in the estimate tend to range over multiples as well.</a></p>\n<p>[6] This ignores worries about 'what distribution': we might think that given the large uncertainties about poor meat-eating, broad-run convergence, value of yet-to-exist beings etc. etc. mean both Givewell estimates and others are going to be prone to a lot of scatter - these considerations might comprise the\u00a0<em>bulk\u00a0</em>of variance in expected value. You can probably take out sources of uncertainty that are symmetric when comparing between two estimators, but it can be difficult to give 'fair dealing' to both, and not colour ones estimates of estimate accuracy with sources of variance you include for one intervention but not another. Take this as an illustration rather than a careful attempt to evaluate directed far future interventions.</p>\n<p>There is an interesting corollary here, though. You might take the future seriously (e.g. you're a total utilitarian), but also hold their is some convergence between good things now and good things in the future thanks to flow-through effects. You may be uncertain about whether you should give to causes with proven direct impact now (and therefore likely good impact into the future thanks to flow through) or to a cause with a speculative but very large potential upside across the future.</p>\n<p>The foregoing suggests a useful heuristic for these decisions. If you hold there is broad run covergence, then you could phrase it as something like, \"Impact measured over the near term and total impact are positively correlated\". The crucial question is how strong this correlation is: roughly, if you think measured near-term impact correlates\u00a0<em>more strongly</em>\u00a0with total impact than your estimation of far future causes correlates with total impact,\u00a0this weighs in favour of giving to the 'good thing now' cause over the 'speculative large benefit in the future' cause, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>[7] This implies that the sort of 'back of the envelope' comparisons EAs are fond of making are probably worthless, and better refrained from.</p>\n<p>[8] My hunch is this sort of surprise should also lead one to update towards 'broad' in the 'broad versus targeted' debate, but I'm not so confident about that.</p>\n<p>[9] Holden Karnofsky has also offered a\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/09/29/errors-in-dcp2-cost-effectiveness-estimate-for-deworming/\">mathematical gloss</a>\u00a0to illustrate Givewell's scepticism and regressive mindset (but he is keen to point out this is meant as illustration, that it is not Givewell's 'official' take, and that Givewell's perspective on these issues does not rely on the illustration he offers). Although I am not the best person to judge, and will all due respect meant, I believe this essay improves on his work:</p>\n<p>The model by Karnofsky has the deeply implausible characteristic that your expected value should start to\u00a0<em>fall</em>\u00a0as you estimated expected value\u00a0<em>rises</em>, and so the mapping of likelihood onto posterior is no longer order-preserving: if A has a mean estimate of 10 units value and B an estimate of 20 units value, you should think A has a\u00a0<em>higher\u00a0</em>\u00a0expected value than B.\u00a0The reason the model demonstrates this pathological feature is that it stipulates the SD of the estimate should always equal its mean: as a consequence for their model, no matter how high the mean estimate, you should assign ~37% credence (&gt;-1SD) that the real value should be negative - worse, as the mean estimate\u00a0<em>increases</em>, lower percentiles (e.g. the 5% ~-2SD confidence bound) continue to fall, so that whilst an intervention of mean expected value of 5 Units has &lt;&lt;1% of its probability mass at -10 or less, this ceases to be the case with an intervention with a mean expected value of 50 Units or 500. Another way of looking at what is going on is the steep increase in the SD means that the estimate becomes less informative far more rapidly than its mean rises, and so the update ignores the new information more and more as the mean rises (given updating is commutative, it might be clearer the other way around: you have this very vague estimate, and then you attend to the new estimate with 'only' an SD of 1 compared to 500 or 1000 or so, and strongly update to that).</p>\n<p>This seems both implausible on its face and doesn't concord with our experience as to how estimators work in the wild either. The motivating intuition (that your expected error/credence interval/whatever of an estimate should get bigger as your estimate grows) is better captured with using fatter tailed distributions (e.g. the confidence interval grows in absolute terms with log-normal distributions).</p>\n<p>I also think this is one case where the frequentist story gives an easier route to something robust and understandable than talk of Bayesian updating. It is harder to get 'hard numbers' (i.e. 'so how much do I adjust downwards from the estimate?') out the Bayesian story as easily as the geometric one provided above, and the importance (as we'll see later) of multiple - preferably independent - estimates can be seen more easily, at least by my lights.</p>\n<p>[10] These things might overlap: it may be the best way of doing research in cause prioritization is trialing particular causes and seeing how they turn out, and - particularly in far future directed causes - the line between 'intervention' and 'research' could get fuzzy. However, it suggests in many cases the primarily value of these activities\u00a0<em>is\u00a0</em>the value of information gains, rather than the putative 'direct' impact (c.f. '<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/12/20/more-on-the-ranking-of-our-top-charities/\">Giving to Learn</a>').</p>\n<p>[11] It also seems fertile ground to better analyse things like search strategy, and the trade off between evaluating many things less accurately or fewer things more rigorously in terms of finding the highest expected value causes.</p></div></div>"},

So I may have something valuable to share with EA\u2019s on media distortion. When young I was interviewed in school with some of the other kids on a few occasions. Sometimes we\u2019d be interviewed because the school had a different methodology, sometimes because they needed good students, the reasons were variegated, but one thing remained constant. I\u2019d notice that the TV show would come to the school already knowing exactly what they wanted us to say. They\u2019d basically tell the teacher what he should inquire us about or lecture about, and the teacher would do so. Later they would interview us with questions hardly related to the class they were supposed to be covering, and even these questions would later be cut into a few seconds of something they already knew to begin with. I noticed that even the news part of TV was not news back then, it was pre-arranged fake reality.</p>\n<p>As an arrogant young teenager, at age 14, I refused giving further interviews and I\u2019d leave class if it was being filmed for some reason.</p>\n<p>Sometimes though, you want to be filmed for some ulterior purpose. This happened to me a few years ago when a movie director and producer came to me asking whether I would think it is a good idea that she made a documentary about me. More specifically, a documentary about the fact that I wanted to be cryopreserved when I died, \u201cDiego Wants to Live Forever\u201d. I was shocked and felt unsure about it. I sat down and told her \u201cI can only decide later on\u201d. So I asked people what they would do on <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/6v0/if_your_cryonicism_would_be_movie_topic_would_you/\"><span>LessWrong</span></a>, the World\u2019s largest rationality blog.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t want to be filmed for filming\u2019s sake. But there were ideas I could promote through the film: discussion of the Technological Singularity, Transhumanism, Immortalism, all topics unheard of in my native Brazil. Slowly those could be turned into discussion of GWWC and other effective altruist organizations as well, later. So all things considered I choose for it. The movie is yet to be released since it grew from a 15 to a 60 minutes documentary. The one thing I kept in mind throughout is that if my goal was to self promote, to promote my image, the movie would be a terrrible way to do so, since being the sole cryonicist in a christian country makes you look completely insane, not fashionable and interesting. If I wanted to promote those ideas, I\u2019d pay a price in my image but attracting new interested people to those memes that surround cryonics (not to cryonics itself, I have no interest in promoting it) seemed to be worthy. If someone wants to interview you or film you, always consider it a personal image sacrifice for a cause, and see if the cause is worthy enough. You\u2019ll never be depicted as you\u2019d like to be. If you are not the writer, then the goal of the media is not your goal, check trade-offs carefully.</p>\n<p>After that I was featured on a TED talk. TED is libertarian media so they actually let you do what you came to do, and help you improve. The purpose of the TED@ event was to select people for TED Global 2013. No one from my country got selected, but that didn\u2019t matter, because the topic on which I spoke, Effective Altruism, got selected. TED curators are smart, and they had no reason to pick me over anyone to talk on TED Global about Effective Altruism, they did what they should and invited Peter Singer to speak on behalf of the movement. Some media can really help you achieve your goals, specially if your goals don\u2019t mind whether you are present or not, nearly always the case with Effective Altruism. If the media that wants you is TED like, go for it and don\u2019t worry, they are there to help you.</p>\n<p>Later on were my 15 seconds of fame. This time I knew the distortion would be drastic, uncanny, absurd. The world's second largest TV network, (Globo, wanted to interview me for their most-viewed Sunday show. At the same time, Record, a smaller TV network, was going to broadcast their own interview with me. Basically, 40 million people would see me on TV. This is a massive amount of people, and I knew nothing I said could be immune from distortion, you don\u2019t get to be the second worldwide without some manipulation skills. The interview was again related to the one thing I don\u2019t want to get people\u2019s attention to, cryonics. A man\u2019s body was being held in the country due to a legal fight between sisters, since he wanted to be cryopreserved and only the daughter who lived with him wanted to send him to Cryonics Institute. That is what the media wants, they want to see half sisters fighting over a dead frozen body, that\u2019s what gets most eyeballs, and I was a side dish given I\u2019m the only Brazilian actually signed up for cryonics.</p>\n<p>Not long before I was contacted to provide the interview, I had founded the Effective Altruism and Transhumanism promoting institute, <a href=\"http://www.ierfh.org/\">http://www.ierfh.org</a>, we were growing and producing a lot. Our purpose was broadcasting, and there would never be a chance of broadcasting the right things for 40 million people. The question in my mind was, was it worth it to broadcast the wrong things?</p>\n<p>I decided in favor of it. I tried to negotiate with the reporters so that my name would appear as \u201cIERFH\u2019s director\u201d somehow. Something, a tiny tiny thing, that could connect that whole tragic comedy they wanted to broadcast as news to my actually serious work related to things I actually cared about. Of course this was to no avail. The major network displayed my name and title in the specific manner they had promised not to before the interview (what am I going to do, sue a company worth tens of billions?) and the other network didn\u2019t do what I asked, but at least also not the exact opposite.</p>\n<p>I had done my homework, I wrote a piece on cryonics connecting it to Transhumanism to attract those who googled about me or cryonics or both. The bridge was there. We paid Google ads to show up on top on Google for a few days. If there were similar minds we would attract them to talk to us and collaborate.</p>\n<p>What I learned from my experience is that 40 million is a massive number of people. It is so massive that though I appeared for a very short time in one channel, and none of the links that I wanted them to provide were there, dozens of people came to me or to us in the next few days. Few had something to offer or knew what they were talking about, but it has shown me the power of big numbers. When people say no press is bad press, it\u2019s because when you have massive numbers, there will be some viewers on the most favourable end of the bell curve who can help you. If the press is big enough, I recommend you do it, regardless of distortion. It\u2019s those who see through that matter most.</p>\n<p>But for most press related matters, the numbers are more mundane, in the low thousands, and the costs and benefits are more comparable. Sometimes it is better not to do it. The recent coverage of effective altruism by Rhys Southan (with a distorted title, but keep in mind not even your interviewer has complete control over his writing), is a good case in point. I invite you to use it as proxy for how much you are willing to be distorted. Here are the parts of his article that mention my name:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From this point of view, the importance of most individual works of art would have to be negligible compared with, say, deworming 1,000 children. An idea often paraphrased in EA circles is that it doesn\u2019t matter who does something \u2013 what matters is that it gets done. And though artists often pride themselves on the uniqueness of their individuality, it doesn\u2019t follow that they have something uniquely valuable to offer society. On the contrary, says Diego Caleiro, director of the Brazil-based Institute for Ethics, Rationality and the Future of Humanity, most of them are \u2018counterfactually replaceable\u2019: one artist is as pretty much as useful as the next. And of course, the supply is plentiful.</p>\n<p>\u2018We\u2019re actually very stacked out with people who have good mathematic skills, good philosophy skills,\u2019 Robert Wiblin, executive director of the Centre for Effective Altruism, told me. \u2018I would really love to have some artists. We really need visual designers. It would be great to have people think about how Effective Altruism could be promoted through art.\u2019 Aesthetic mavericks who anticipate long wilderness years of rejection and struggle, however, would seem to have little to contribute to the cause. Perhaps they should think about ditching their dreams for what Caleiro calls \u2018an area with higher expected returns\u2019.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the next paragraphs, about a 1/4 of the whole written interview, are the content from which he drew those above (the rest was simply discarded), I don\u2019t want you to assume that I found his representation of me very degrading or very uplifting. I want you to see for what it actually is, so you can judge for yourself whether you would do an interview if you were in my place. And since our cluster of ideas, like transhumanism and effective altruism are becoming more mainstream by the day, it may not be long before you may have to face similar choices to those I did. Here it is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>When I was originally going to write an article about effective altruism, it was going to be about earning to give. My one hesitation was that I felt like someone else could easily write a similar article about earning to give, and I worried that made my \u201creplaceability\u201d very high. (And it turns out it was \u2014 someone had already written such an article.) Do you find yourself applying the concept of \u201creplaceability\u201d to other aspects of your life? Like could you consider the replaceability of someone you\u2019re dating and the marginal improvement of happiness they bring to your life compared to someone else you could be dating?</em></p>\n<p>That is a great question because Love, as very few things in life, is exactly the kind of emotion in which you can\u2019t apply the logic or replaceability, or as we philosophers call it, counterfactuals. A great part of what love is is valuing a relationship. A specific one relationship that is built over time. Most songs about love, as Marvin Minsky reminds us, are about how the loved one could become anything, even a dumb psycho crazy nutcrack, and we would still love them. There are things that counterfactual reasoning can\u2019t buy. For all others, there is effective altruism.</p>\n<p><em>I suspect artists will tend to resist the effective altruism idea: there seems to be no place for them within EA, unless they happen to already be very successful, in which case they can earn to give. Do aspiring artists who want to do art full time pretty much have to give up that dream and change courses if they want to become effective altruists?</em></p>\n<p>Artists are fighting in red markets. The things they make dispute people\u2019s attention, and there are way more things available to pay attention to then there is attention to be given. Nearly all artists are counterfactually replaceable. This is why you feel they have no space within the EA movement. What I find interesting is that most of the early effective altruists come from a philosophy background, and the exact same is true of philosophy. Nearly no one reads academic publications by philosophers, and the area is so disputed it is hardly the case that anyone who left the profession would leave a significant blank behind that no one else could fulfill. Even then the EA movement thrives among philosophers, we should expect that over time, artists will find similar unusual paths to either conciliate their interests, or else shift their perspectives.</p>\n<p><em>And related to the previous question, one thing that effective altruism does is put things in perspective, and artists and other creators of various sorts won\u2019t like the perspective EA provides: by judging actions based on how much they improve well-being and decrease harm, the works of art, comedy routines and so on that people create turn out not to be that important after all. Devoting years of your life to writing a novel, for instance \u2014 while many see this as noble in some way \u2014 seems to be a horribly inefficient way to make a positive difference. Is there a way to reconcile effective altruism with artists\u2019 beliefs that their creations are worthwhile contributions?</em></p>\n<p>The short answer is no. Something will have to give, either effective altruist artists shift their art to promote altruism, like some friends of mine are doing here in S\u00e3o Paulo, or they abandon the artistic field. Art is a noble pursuit, and it should always be the case that a small subset of humanity is pursuing artistic expression and interacting with the world in that way. But I don\u2019t think it will ever be the case that this subset will become so small that it would actually be worth it, all things considered, to choose to become a novelist instead of an effective altruist in some other area with higher expected returns. Not because the value of art is any less than people believe it is, but just because it is infinitely easier to understand the value of art, than to understand the value of saving the lives of hundreds of people who live across the ocean, or across the century. When I say it explicitly it may not seem that way, but hundreds of millions of people are able to see the value of art, and only very few, less than one in a million, if you consider the entire world, have already understood how much good they can create by being as altruistic as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is it, make your decisions accordingly and keep in mind that the media is part of reality, in a sense, of nature, it is not good or bad intrinsically. It has it\u2019s properties just like gravity, which can help or hinder, and if you want to use it, you have to understand those properties and be prepared for them.</p>\n<div><br></div></div></div>"},

An excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flyers at petrol stations do not normally ask for someone to donate a kidney to an unrelated stranger. That such a poster, in a garage in Indiana, actually did persuade a donor to come forward might seem extraordinary. But extraordinary people such as the respondent to this appeal (those who volunteer to deliver aid by truck in Syria at the moment might also qualify) are sufficiently common to be worth investigating. And in a paper published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Abigail Marsh of Georgetown University and her colleagues do just that. Their conclusion is that extreme altruists are at one end of a \u201ccaring continuum\u201d which exists in human populations\u2014a continuum that has psychopaths at the other end. [...]</p>\n<p>She and her team used two brain-scanning techniques, structural and functional magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI), to study the amygdalas of 39 volunteers, 19 of whom were altruistic kidney donors. (The amygdalas, of which brains have two, one in each hemisphere, are areas of tissue central to the processing of emotion and empathy.) Structural MRI showed that the right amygdalas of altruists were 8.1% larger, on average, than those of people in the control group, though everyone\u2019s left amygdalas were about the same size. That is, indeed, the obverse of what pertains in psychopaths, whose right amygdalas, previous studies have shown, are smaller than those of controls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whether this applies to EAs, however, is unclear. Compare Peter Singer's recent <a href=\"http://www.bostonreview.net/forum/against-empathy/peter-singer-response-against-empathy-peter-singer\">remarks</a>\u00a0in a panel discussion about empathy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My admittedly impressionistic observation is that effective altruists are not especially empathetic\u2014at least, not in the sense of emotional empathy. They do have what is sometimes called \u201ccognitive empathy\u201d or \u201cperspective taking\u201d capacity\u2014that is, the ability to see what life is like for someone else.</p>\n</blockquote></div></div>"},

That is, it would be permissible and perhaps also morally better to give more, but not wrong to refuse to do this \u2013 giving still more would be going beyond the call of duty.\u00a0 And although they\u2019re in the minority, there are some who think that every act of self-sacrifice is supererogatory, no matter how small the sacrifice and no matter how greatly others would benefit.</p>\n<p>When it\u2019s supererogatory, or morally optional, <em>whether</em> to give your $200 to charity or instead keep it for yourself, does it follow that it\u2019s morally optional <em>where </em>you give your $200, if you do give it to charity?\u00a0 Many seem tempted to accept this inference, but I don\u2019t think we should. \u00a0(<span>See note 1</span>.)</p>\n<p>Consider a thought-experiment.\u00a0 There is 1 person drowning in West Lake and 100 people drowning just to the east in East Lake.\u00a0 If you were at the same latitude as these lakes, it\u2019d be virtually costless to save the 1 and virtually costless to save the 100, but impossible to save all 101 (you can launch a rescue boat into one lake or the other).\u00a0 Unfortunately you\u2019re 50 miles south of the lakes, and it\u2019d cost you $200 (including inconvenience) to travel up to them.\u00a0 Assume it\u2019s supererogatory to incur the $200 cost to travel north.\u00a0 Nonetheless, it seems that if you <em>did </em>travel north and were at the same latitude as both lakes, you\u2019d be morally required to save the 100 people in East Lake over the 1 in West Lake.\u00a0 (Once you\u2019re up there, it feels like you\u2019re in a simple <a href=\"http://individual.utoronto.ca/stafforini/parfit/parfit_-_innumerate_ethics.pdf\">\u201csave the greater number\u201d case</a>.)\u00a0 In this example, it\u2019d be morally optional whether to travel up to the lakes, but <em>not</em> morally optional where to offer assistance once there. \u00a0(<span>See note 2</span>.)</p>\n<p>One might object that this isn\u2019t how giving to charity typically works.\u00a0 It\u2019s not as if you first pay $200 to some meta-charity, and subsequently decide whether it goes to charity X or to charity Y.\u00a0 Instead, typically the reality is that whether to donate and where to donate are bundled together in a single choice:\u00a0 you can donate $0, donate $200 <em>to charity X</em>, or donate $200 <em>to charity Y</em>.</p>\n<p>In response, I could revise the thought-experiment:\u00a0 West Lake and East Lake are 100 miles apart, and you\u2019re right in between them.\u00a0 You could pay $200 to go west (where you could virtually costlessly save 1) or you could instead pay $200 to go east (where you could virtually costlessly save 100).\u00a0 Again, you can\u2019t save all 101.\u00a0 Again, we\u2019re supposing it\u2019s morally optional whether to incur the cost of $200 at all.\u00a0 But it doesn\u2019t follow that <em>if</em> you are going to incur this cost, it is morally optional whether you head east or west.\u00a0 On the contrary, it seems that if you <em>are</em> going to incur this cost and end up at one lake or the other, you are morally required to go east where you\u2019d do much more good.\u00a0 And this does appear analogous to situations we\u2019re often in with regard to charitable donation.\u00a0 While you might not be morally required to give your $200 to charity, if you <em>are</em> going to donate it, and you have the choice between a charity X that would use it to save 1 life and a charity Y that would use it to save 100 lives, you should donate to charity Y (<span>see note 3</span>).\u00a0 (Where this \u201cshould\u201d entails that it would be wrong of you not to donate to charity Y.)</p>\n<p>One might reasonably ask what it is that ultimately <em>makes</em> it permissible not to donate the $200 at all \u2013 for it could turn out that whatever this is would in turn make it permissible to donate to charity X as well as permissible to donate to charity Y.\u00a0 I believe a defensible answer is that your own well-being (and <a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2014/10/people-and-charitable-causes-are-importantly-different-things/\">perhaps also the well-being of those near and dear to you</a>) generates special permission for you to act in a way that is not optimal from a fully impartial perspective.\u00a0 Perhaps you\u2019d be permitted to save yourself (or your loved one) over 100 strangers.\u00a0 But suppose you\u2019ve decided to donate your $200 to \u201ccharity,\u201d where this refers to a long disjunction of particular charities A, B, C, \u2026X, Y, Z, none of which would, if donated to, benefit you (or anyone near and dear to you).\u00a0 Indeed, this is a fairly realistic situation for donors to find themselves in \u2013 as so many charities help distant needy strangers.\u00a0 Thus we can see that it doesn\u2019t follow from the claim that it\u2019s morally optional whether to give that it\u2019s morally optional where to give.</p>\n<p>Next one might object that what makes it permissible for you not to donate the $200 at all is simply a matter of your <em>desires</em>.\u00a0 The thought continues:\u00a0 If you desire to \u201cdonate\u201d the money to <em>yourself </em>(or to a friend, a family member, a restaurant server, etc.), it\u2019s permissible to do so, and so similarly if you desire to donate the money to charity X rather than the much more cost-effective charity Y, it\u2019s likewise permissible to do so.\u00a0 But unless the frustration of your desire to give to charity X constitutes a genuine cost to you, the second half of the previous sentence is very implausible.\u00a0 If you could costlessly save the 1 in West Lake or costlessly save the 100 in East Lake, it wouldn\u2019t be permissible to save the 1 in West Lake merely in virtue of your desire to do so.\u00a0 If on the other hand the frustration of your desire to give to charity X did constitute a genuine cost to you (as certain desire-satisfaction theories of well-being imply), then perhaps it\u2019d be permissible to give to charity X.\u00a0 But it\u2019s worth noticing that <em>apart from your having this desire</em> there\u2019s nothing costlier to you about you giving to charity X rather than charity Y, and charity Y is much better from an impartial point of view.\u00a0 Insofar as changing your desire is itself costless to you (or perhaps it\u2019d even be beneficial to you to bring your desires closer into alignment with reason!) it\u2019s plausible that you <em>should</em> desire giving to Y instead of X.\u00a0 (This isn\u2019t to say you should give to Y, assuming your desires haven\u2019t yet changed.)</p>\n<p>Finally, as before, there remains the simple point that, while you may have a desire to donate your $200 to yourself over giving it to charity, your desires themselves may be neutral when it comes to selecting between particular charities A through Z.\u00a0 This happens often enough.\u00a0 And so in these cases permission not to donate wouldn\u2019t imply that it\u2019s permissible to donate to any charity, given that one does choose to donate to charity.</p>\n<p>Many people give to charity (and not just to \u201ccharity\u201d but also to friends, family, etc.) not on the basis of <em>mere</em> desires, or whims, but on the basis of deep emotional connections and commitments.\u00a0 Perhaps the basis of your permission whether, and where, to give isn\u2019t simply a matter of your desires, but rather of what\u2019s <em>close to your heart</em>.\u00a0 Perhaps deep emotional connections can generate such permissions.\u00a0 But first, even if so, this wouldn\u2019t support a general inference from \u201cpermissibility whether to give\u201d to \u201cpermissibility where to give,\u201d since there will remain cases in which your emotional connections are neutral with respect to the particular charities you can donate to. \u00a0And second, surely there are <em>limits</em> on the sort of permission that emotional connections could plausibly generate \u2013 they can\u2019t plausibly permit you to act in ways that are <em>much </em>worse from an impartial standpoint.\u00a0 Return to the West Lake versus East Lake example.\u00a0 Suppose you\u2019ve worked as a lifeguard for West Lake for many years, and have a serious emotional connection and commitment to helping people there.\u00a0 You can save 1 person drowning there, or save 100 people drowning in East Lake (all strangers to you).\u00a0 It seems implausible that the fact that helping people in West Lake is closer to your heart could permit you to save the 1 over the 100.\u00a0 Should it matter if we replaced \u201chelping people in West Lake\u201d with \u201chelping people in the United States\u201d or \u201chelping people who have suffered from some illness you\u2019re especially emotionally connected to (such as cancer)?\u201d \u00a0I do not believe so.\u00a0 But just how strong must the emotional connection or commitment be to generate significant permissions whether and where to give, and just what are the limits of the permissions generated? \u00a0These are difficult questions I won\u2019t be able to settle here.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been discussing where you should donate your money, assuming that it\u2019s permissible for you not to donate to charity at all (either because you\u2019ve already given so much or because the duty of beneficence is very undemanding).\u00a0 I\u2019ve argued that at least as long as you\u2019re donating to charities that are equally good from the standpoint of your own interests (and the interests of those near and dear to you, and your desires, and what\u2019s close to your heart), you should donate to the ones that do the most good from an impartial standpoint.\u00a0 The moral option not to give to charity at all doesn\u2019t entail that it\u2019s morally optional where to give.\u00a0 But for all that, probably most of us would have to give considerably more before the moral option not to give kicks in. \u00a0I suspect the truth is that <a href=\"http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0195108590.001.0001/acprof-9780195108590\">the duty of beneficence is pretty demanding by comparison with commonsense standards</a>, and that few of us really do give enough.\u00a0 I doubt I do.</p>\n<p><em>I am grateful to Caley Anderson, Tom Ash, Gulzaar Barn, Roger Crisp, Michelle Hutchinson, Brian McElwee, Andreas Mogensen, Caleb Ontiveros, and Peter Singer for helpful discussions.</em></p>\n<p><span>Notes</span>:</p>\n<p>1. \u00a0Some qualifications:\u00a0 First, I am not here discussing\u00a0<em>legal\u00a0</em>options or rights; if there weren\u2019t and ought not to be laws compelling people to donate money to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/\">Oxfam</a>, this wouldn\u2019t settle the question of whether it\u2019s\u00a0<em>morally</em>\u00a0optional to donate there.\u00a0 Second, though the following discussion is couched in terms of saving lives,\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2014/11/what-kind-of-altruism-is-most-effective/\">it\u2019s highly debatable whether life-saving charities are best from an impartial point of view</a>.\u00a0 Arguably, charities that primarily improve quality of life (such as\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.evidenceaction.org/deworm-the-world/\">deworming charities</a>) are better.\u00a0 It\u2019s also worth considering charities that focus on\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/\">animal well-being</a>.\u00a0 My examples could be revised accordingly without damage to the main argument.\u00a0 Third, I recognize that there is a lot of uncertainty about what charities are best or \u201cdo the most good\u201d from an impartial point of view.\u00a0 More radically, it may be indeterminate which are best, or perhaps none is\u00a0<em>best</em>\u00a0but several very good charities are\u00a0<a href=\"http://ruthchang.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/THE-POSSIBILITY-OF-PARITY.pdf\">on a par</a>; I believe the main points of this post are consistent with these possibilities.\u00a0 Importantly, it remains the case that some charities are much better than many others.</p>\n<p>2. \u00a0I\u2019m not the first to offer examples illustrating this point.\u00a0 In\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0198239165.001.0001/acprof-9780198239161\">The Limits of Morality</a></em>\u00a0(p.16), Shelly Kagan imagines that you find a building on fire, and are told that someone may still be trapped inside. \u00a0Plausibly, it is permissible for you not to enter the building to try to rescue them. \u00a0Suppose, however, that you do enter the building and find a child and a caged bird; you can rescue one or the other, not both.\u00a0 Plausibly, it would be wrong to save the bird rather than the child, though it would not have been wrong for you to have refused to save the child by refusing to enter the building out of concern for your own safety.\u00a0 (In Kagan\u2019s example the cost to you is much greater than the cost to you in the lakes example, as well as greater than the cost to you in more everyday cases of donating to charity.)</p>\n<p>3. \u00a0Typically it costs considerably more money than this to save lives.\u00a0 Arguably the most cost-effective life-saving charity (<a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/Default.aspx\">the Against Malaria Foundation</a>) saves a life roughly every $3,000 received.</p>\n<!--

{"date": "9th Sep 2014", "title": "\"Efficiency\" Measures Miss the Point", "author": "Introduction", "num_comments": "3 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>by Dan Pallotta, originally on <a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/2009/06/efficiency-measures-miss-the-p/\">HBR Blogs</a></em></p>\n<p>An e-mail I got from a former employee last week exemplified a dangerous public mythology: \u201cYou see, for every dollar a donor gives they have the expectation that it\u2019s used efficiently. After all they have choices, they can give that same dollar to another charity. Donors want their donations to go as far as possible\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>There are two fatal errors here. The first is that high administrative efficiency equals high impact. It doesn\u02bct. The second is that the admin-to-program ratio is measuring efficiency. <strong>If it isn\u02bct measuring impact, it\u02bcs axiomatic that it isn\u02bct measuring efficiency</strong>, because the only efficiency that matters is the efficiency associated with impact. Take the frugal breast cancer charity that consistently fails to find a cure for breast cancer. The last word a woman dying of breast cancer would use to describe it would be \u201cefficient.\u201d Not if she factors in the value of her life.</p>\n<p>As for making donations \u201cgo as far as possible,\u201d consider two soup kitchens. Soup kitchen A reports that 90% of every donation goes to the cause. Soup Kitchen B reports 70%. You should donate to A, right? No-brainer. Unless you actually visited the two and found that the so-called more \u201cefficient\u201d Soup Kitchen A serves rancid soup in a dilapidated building with an unpleasant staff and is closed half the time, while Soup Kitchen B is open 24/7, and has a super-friendly staff that serves nutritious soup in a state-of-the-art facility.\u00a0<strong>Now</strong>\u00a0which looks better? The admin: program ratio would have failed you completely. It betrays your trust. It\u02bcs utterly\u00a0<strong>deficient</strong>\u00a0in data about which soup kitchen is better at serving soup. It undermines your compassion and insults your contribution. And yet we praise it as a yardstick of morality and trustworthiness. It\u02bcs the exact opposite.</p>\n<p>We should stop saying charities with low ratios are efficient. Efficient at what? Fundraising? \u201cInefficient\u201d \u2014 as in expedient \u2014 fundraising may accelerate problem-solving, making its \u201cinefficiency\u201d efficient in the big picture. Say Jonas Salk spent $50 million to raise $100 million to find a polio vaccine. The admin:program ratio would report he had a shameful 50% overhead. But the $100 million he raised wasn\u02bct his end result. His end result was a vaccine. Divide the $50 million fundraising expense into the God-only-knows-how-many billions of dollars a polio vaccine is worth, and his overhead ratio at eradicating polio is 0%. A hypothetical competing charity with 10% fundraising cost that comes up empty on a vaccine has\u00a0<strong>100% overhead\u00a0</strong>against the goal of a vaccine, because it never found one.

{"date": "13th Aug 2014", "title": "Strategic considerations about different speeds of AI takeoff", "author": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt", "num_comments": "4 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em><strong><em>Crossposted from the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/strategic-considerations-about-different-speeds-of-ai-takeoff/\">Global Priorities Project</a></em></strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Co-written by Owen Cotton-Barratt and Toby Ord</strong></em></p><p>There are several different kinds of artificial general intelligence (AGI) which might be developed, and there are different scenarios which could play out after one of them reaches a roughly human level of ability across a wide range of tasks. We shall discuss some of the implications we can see for these different scenarios, and what that might tell us about how we should act today.</p><p>A key difference between different types of post-AGI scenario is the \u2018speed of takeoff\u2019. This could be thought of as the time between first reaching a near human-level artificial intelligence and reaching one that far exceeds our capacities in almost all areas (or reaching a world where almost all economically productive work is done by artificial intelligences). In fast takeoff scenarios, this might happen over a scale of months, weeks, or days. In slow takeoff scenarios, it might take years or decades. There has been considerable discussion about which speed of takeoff is more likely, but less discussion about which is more desirable and what that implies.\n</p><h2 id=\"Are_slow_takeoffs_more_desirable_\">Are slow takeoffs more desirable?</h2>\nThere are a few reasons to think that we\u2019re more likely to get a good outcome in a slow takeoff scenario.<p></p><p>First, safety work today has an issue of <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/the-timing-of-labour-aimed-at-reducing-existential-risk/\">neartsightedness</a>. Since we don\u2019t know quite what form artificial intelligence will eventually take, specific work today may end up being of no help on the problem we eventually face. If we had a slow takeoff scenario, there would be a period of time in which AGI safety researchers had a much better idea of the nature of the threat, and were able to optimise their work accordingly. This could make their work several times more valuable.</p><p>Second, and perhaps more crucially, in a slow takeoff the concerns about AGI safety are likely to spread much more widely through society. It is easy to imagine this producing widespread societal support of a level at or exceeding that for work on climate change, because the issue would be seen to be imminent. This could translate to much more work on securing a good outcome -- perhaps hundreds of times the total which had previously been done. Although there are some benefits to have work done serially rather than in parallel, these are likely to be overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of extra high-quality work which would attack the problem. Furthermore, the slower the takeoff, the more this additional work can also be done serially.</p><p>A third key factor is that a slow takeoff seems more likely to lead to a highly multipolar scenario. If AGI has been developed commercially, the creators are likely to licence out copies for various applications. Moreover it could give enough time for competitors to bring alternatives up to speed.</p><p>We don\u2019t think it\u2019s clear whether multipolar outcomes are overall a good thing, but we note that they have some advantages. In the short term they are likely to preserve something closer to the existing balance of power, which gives more time for work to ensure a safe future. They are additionally less sensitive to the prospect of a treacherous turn or of any single-point failure mode in an AGI.\n</p><h2 id=\"Strategic_implications\">Strategic implications</h2>\nIf we think that there will be much more time for safety work in slow takeoff scenarios, there seem to be two main implications:<p></p><p>First, when there is any chance to influence matters, we should generally push towards slow takeoff scenarios. They are likely to have much more safety work done, and this is a large factor which could easily outweigh our other information about the relative desirability of the scenarios.</p><p>Second, we should generally focus safety research today on fast takeoff scenarios. Since there will be much less safety work in total in these scenarios, extra work is likely to have a much larger marginal effect. This can be seen as hedging against a fast takeoff even if we think it is undesirable.</p><p>Overall it seems to us that the AGI safety community has internalised the second point, and sensibly focused on work addressing fast takeoff scenarios. It is less clear that we have appropriately weighed the first point. Either of these points could be strengthened or outweighed by a better understanding of the relevant scenarios.</p><p>For example, it seems that neuromorphic AGI would be much harder to understand and control than an AGI with a much clearer internal architecture. So conditional on a fast takeoff, it would be bad if the AGI were neuromorphic. People concerned with AGI safety have argued against a neuromorphic approach on these grounds. However, precisely because it is opaque, neuromorphic AGI may be less able to perform fast recursive self-improvement, and this would decrease the chance of a fast takeoff. Given how much better a slow takeoff appears, we should perhaps <i>prefer</i> neuromorphic approaches.</p><p>In general, the AGI safety community focuses much of its attention on recursive self-improvement approaches to designing a highly intelligent system. We think that this makes sense in as much as it draws attention to the dangers of fast takeoff scenarios and hedges against being in one, but we would want to take care not to <i>promote</i> the approach for those considering designing an AGI. Drawing attention to the power of recursive self improvement could end up being self-defeating if it encourages people to design such systems, producing a faster takeoff.\nIn conclusion it seems that when doing direct technical safety work, may be reasonable to condition on a fast takeoff, as that is the scenario where our early work matters most. When choosing strategic direction, however, it is a mistake to condition on a fast takeoff, precisely because our decisions may affect the probability of a fast takeoff.</p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Dewey for conversations and comments.</em></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "30th Jul 2014", "title": "How to treat problems of unknown difficulty", "author": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>Crossposted from the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/how-to-treat-problems-of-unknown-difficulty/\">Global Priorities Project</a></em></p><p>This is the first in a series of posts which take aim at the question: how should we prioritise work on problems where we have very little idea of our chances of success. In this post we\u2019ll see some simple models-from-ignorance which allow us to produce some estimates of the chances of success from extra work. In later posts we\u2019ll examine the counterfactuals to estimate the value of the work. For those who prefer a different medium, I gave <a href=\"http://www.gooddoneright.com/#!owen-cotton-barratt/c6xs\">a talk on this topic</a> at the Good Done Right conference in Oxford this July.\n</p><h2 id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</h2>\nHow hard is it to build an economically efficient fusion reactor? How hard is it to prove or disprove the Goldbach conjecture? How hard is it to produce a machine superintelligence? How hard is it to write down a concrete description of our values?<p></p><p>These are all hard problems, but we don\u2019t even have a good idea of just how hard they are, even to an order of magnitude. This is in contrast to a problem like giving a laptop to every child, where we know that it\u2019s hard but we could produce a fairly good estimate of how much resources it would take.</p><p>Since we need to make choices about how to prioritise between work on different problems, this is clearly an important issue. We can prioritise using benefit-cost analysis, choosing the projects with the highest ratio of future benefits to present costs. When we don\u2019t know how hard a problem is, though, our ignorance makes the size of the costs unclear, and so the analysis is harder to perform. Since we make decisions anyway, we are implicitly making some judgements about when work on these projects is worthwhile, but we may be making mistakes.</p><p>In this article, we\u2019ll explore practical epistemology for dealing with these problems of unknown difficulty.\n</p><h3 id=\"Definition\">Definition</h3>\nWe will use a simplifying model for problems: that they have a critical threshold <i>D</i> such that the problem will be completely solved when <i>D</i> resources are expended, and not at all before that. We refer to this as the <i>difficulty</i> of the problem. After the fact the graph of success with resources will look something like this:<p></p><p><img title=\"\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/image?id=sjmeN788LI628vjzrvHe9aA&amp;rev=1&amp;h=193&amp;w=620&amp;ac=1\" alt=\"\">\n</p><p>Of course the assumption is that we don\u2019t know <i>D</i>. So our uncertainty about where the threshold is will smooth out the curve in expectation. Our expectation beforehand for success with resources will end up looking something like this:</p>\n<p><img title=\"\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/image?id=s4UN1-jqnB8OVgxnGYeZYOw&amp;rev=1&amp;h=193&amp;w=620&amp;ac=1\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Assuming a fixed difficulty is a simplification, since of course resources are not all homogenous, and we may get lucky or unlucky. I believe that this is a reasonable simplification, and that taking these considerations into account would not change our expectations by much, but I plan to explore this more carefully in a future post.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 id=\"What_kind_of_problems_are_we_looking_at_\">What kind of problems are we looking at?</h2>\nWe\u2019re interested in one-off problems where we have a lot of uncertainty about the difficulty. That is, the kind of problem we only need to solve once (answering a question a first time can be Herculean; answering it a second time is trivial), and which may not easily be placed in a reference class with other tasks of similar difficulty. Knowledge problems, as in research, are a central example: they boil down to finding the answer to a question. The category might also include trying to effect some systemic change (for example by political lobbying).<p></p><p>This is in contrast to engineering problems which can be reduced down, roughly, to performing a known task many times. Then we get a fairly good picture of how the problem scales. Note that this includes some knowledge work: the \u201cknown task\u201d may actually be different each time. For example, proofreading two pages of text is quite the same, but we have a fairly good reference class so we can estimate moderately well the difficulty of proofreading a page of text, and quite well the difficulty of proofreading a 100,000-word book (where the length helps to smooth out the variance in estimates of individual pages).</p><p>Some knowledge questions can naturally be broken up into smaller sub-questions. However these typically won\u2019t be a tight enough class that we can use this to estimate the difficulty of the overall problem from the difficult of the first few sub-questions. It may well be that one of the sub-questions carries essentially all of the difficulty, so making progress on the others is only a very small help.\n</p><h2 id=\"Model_from_extreme_ignorance\">Model from extreme ignorance</h2>\nOne approach to estimating the difficulty of a problem is to assume that we understand essentially nothing about it. If we are completely ignorant, we have no information about the scale of the difficulty, so we want a scale-free prior. This determines that the prior obeys a power law. Then, we update on the amount of resources we have already expended on the problem without success. Our posterior probability distribution for how many resources are required to solve the problem will then be a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution\">Pareto distribution</a>. (Fallenstein and Mennen <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/files/PredictingAGI.pdf\">proposed this model</a> for the difficulty of the problem of making a general-purpose artificial intelligence.)<p></p><p>There is still a question about the shape parameter of the Pareto distribution, which governs how thick the tail is. It is hard to see how to infer this from a priori reasons, but we might hope to estimate it by generalising from a very broad class of problems people have successfully solved in the past.</p><p>This idealised case is a good starting point, but in actual cases, our estimate may be wider or narrower than this. Narrower if either we have some idea of a reasonable (if very approximate) reference class for the problem, or we have some idea of the rate of progress made towards the solution. For example, assuming a Pareto distribution implies that there\u2019s always a nontrivial chance of solving the problem at any minute, and we may be confident that we are not that close to solving it. Broader because a Pareto distribution implies that the problem is certainly solvable, and some problems will turn out to be impossible.</p><p>This might lead people to criticise the idea of using a Pareto distribution. If they have enough extra information that they don\u2019t think their beliefs represent a Pareto distribution, can we still say anything sensible?\n</p><h2 id=\"Reasoning_about_broader_classes_of_model\">Reasoning about broader classes of model</h2>\nIn the previous section, we looked at a very specific and explicit model. Now we take a step back. We assume that people will have complicated enough priors and enough minor sources of evidence that it will in practice be impossible to write down a true distribution for their beliefs. Instead we will reason about some properties that this true distribution should have.<p></p><p>The cases we are interested in are cases where we do not have a good idea of the order of magnitude of the difficulty of a task. This is an imprecise condition, but we might think of it as meaning something like:</p><p>There is no difficulty X such that we believe the probability of D lying between X and 10X is more than 30%.</p><p>Here the \u201c30%\u201d figure can be adjusted up for a less stringent requirement of uncertainty, or down for a more stringent one.</p><p>Now consider what our subjective probability distribution might look like, where difficulty lies on a logarithmic scale. Our high level of uncertainty will smooth things out, so it is likely to be a reasonably smooth curve. Unless we have specific distinct ideas for how the task is likely to be completed, this curve will probably be unimodal. Finally, since we are unsure even of the order of magnitude, the curve cannot be too tight on the log scale.</p><p>Note that this should be our <i>prior </i>subjective probability distribution: we are gauging how hard we would have thought it was before embarking on the project. We\u2019ll discuss below how to update this in the light of information gained by working on it.</p><p>The distribution might look something like this:\n</p><p><img title=\"\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/image?id=sbp3WocPE859Y40AHunc8ew&amp;rev=1&amp;h=235&amp;w=620&amp;ac=1\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In some cases it is probably worth trying to construct an explicit approximation of this curve. However, this could be quite labour-intensive, and we usually have uncertainty even about our uncertainty, so we will not be entirely confident with what we end up with.</p>\nInstead, we could ask what properties tend to hold for this kind of probability distribution. For example, one well-known phenomenon which is roughly true of these distributions but not all probability distributions is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford's_law\">Benford\u2019s law</a>.\n<h3 id=\"Approximating_as_locally_log_uniform\">Approximating as locally log-uniform</h3>\nIt would sometimes be useful to be able to make a simple analytically tractable approximation to the curve. This could be faster to produce, and easily used in a wider range of further analyses than an explicit attempt to model the curve exactly.<p></p><p>As a candidate for this role, we propose working with the assumption that the distribution is locally flat. This corresponds to being log-uniform. The smoothness assumptions we made should mean that our curve is nowhere too far from flat. Moreover, it is a very easy assumption to work with, since it means that the expected returns scale logarithmically with the resources put in: in expectation, a doubling of the resources is equally good regardless of the starting point.</p><p>It is, unfortunately, never exactly true. Although our curves may be approximately flat, they cannot be everywhere flat -- this can\u2019t even give a probability distribution! But it may work reasonably as a model of local behaviour. If we want to turn it into a probability distribution, we can do this by estimating the plausible ranges of D and assuming it is uniform across this scale. In our example we would be approximating the blue curve by something like this red box:\n</p><p><img title=\"\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/image?id=suNHX4cQOodnl0rQgtSpMrw&amp;rev=1&amp;h=235&amp;w=620&amp;ac=1\" alt=\"\"></p>\nObviously in the example the red box is not a fantastic approximation. But nor is it a terrible one. Over the central range, it is never out from the true value by much more than a factor of 2. While crude, this could still represent a substantial improvement on the current state of some of our estimates. A big advantage is that it is easily analytically tractable, so it will be quick to work with. In the rest of this post we\u2019ll explore the consequences of this assumption.\n<h3 id=\"Places_this_might_fail\">Places this might fail</h3>\nIn some circumstances, we might expect high uncertainty over difficulty without everywhere having local log-returns. A key example is if we have bounds on the difficulty at one or both ends.<p></p><p>For example, if we are interested in X, which comprises a task of radically unknown difficulty plus a repetitive and predictable part of difficulty 1000, then our distribution of beliefs of the difficulty about X will only include values above 1000, and may be quite clustered there (so not even approximately logarithmic returns). The behaviour in the positive tail might still be roughly logarithmic.</p><p>In the other direction, we may know that there is a slow and repetitive way to achieve X, with difficulty 100,000. We are unsure whether there could be a quicker way. In this case our distribution will be uncertain over difficulties up to around 100,000, then have a spike. This will give the reverse behaviour, with roughly logarithmic expected returns in the negative tail, and a different behaviour around the spike at the upper end of the distribution.</p><p>In some sense each of these is diverging from the idea that we are very ignorant about the difficulty of the problem, but it may be useful to see how the conclusions vary with the assumptions.\n</p><h2 id=\"Implications_for_expected_returns\">Implications for expected returns</h2>\nWhat does this model tell us about the expected returns from putting resources into trying to solve the problem?<p></p><p>Under the assumption that the prior is locally log-uniform, the full value is realised over the width of the box in the diagram. This is <i>w = </i>log(<i>y</i>) - log(<i>x</i>)<i>, </i>where <i>x </i>is the value at the start of the box (where the problem could first be plausibly solved), <i>y</i> is the value at the end of the box, and our logarithms are natural. Since it\u2019s a probability distribution, the height of the box is 1/<i>w</i>.</p><p>For any <i>z</i> between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, the modelled chance of success from investing <i>z</i> resources is equal to the fraction of the box which has been covered by that point. That is:</p><p>(1)Chance of success before reaching <i>z</i> resources = log(<i>z</i>/<i>x</i>)/log(<i>y</i>/<i>x</i>)<i>.</i></p><p>So while we are in the relevant range, the chance of success is equal for any doubling of the total resources. We could say that we expect <i>logarithmic returns </i>on investing resources.\n</p><h3 id=\"Marginal_returns\">Marginal returns</h3>\nSometimes of greater relevance to our decisions is the marginal chance of success from adding an extra unit of resources at <i>z</i>. This is given by the derivative of Equation (1):<p></p><p>(2)Chance of success from a marginal unit of resource at <i>z</i> = 1/<i>zw</i>.</p><p>So far, we\u2019ve just been looking at estimating the prior probabilities -- before we start work on the problem. Of course when we start work we generally get more information. In particular, if we would have been able to recognise success, and we have invested <i>z</i> resources without observing success, then we learn that the difficulty is at least <i>z</i>. We must update our probability distribution to account for this. In some cases we will have relatively little information beyond the fact that we haven\u2019t succeeded yet. In that case the update will just be to curtail the distribution to the left of <i>z</i> and renormalise, looking roughly like this:\n</p><p><img title=\"\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/image?id=spv3l7LP74kqoBzS2UjJttA&amp;rev=1&amp;h=235&amp;w=620&amp;ac=1\" alt=\"\"></p>\nAgain the blue curve represents our true subjective probability distribution, and the red box represents a simple model approximating this. Now the simple model gives slightly higher estimated chance of success from an extra marginal unit of resources:<p></p><p>(3)Chance of success from an extra unit of resources after <i>z</i> = 1/(<i>z</i>*(ln(<i>y</i>)-ln(<i>z</i>))).</p><p>Of course in practice we often will update more. Even if we don\u2019t have a good idea of how hard fusion is, we can reasonably assign close to zero probability that an extra $100 today will solve the problem today, because we can see enough to know that the solution won\u2019t be found imminently. This looks like it might present problems for this approach. However, the truly decision-relevant question is about the counterfactual impact of extra resource investment. The region where we can see little chance of success has a much smaller effect on that calculation, which we discuss below.\n</p><h3 id=\"Comparison_with_returns_from_a_Pareto_distribution\">Comparison with returns from a Pareto distribution</h3>\nWe mentioned that one natural model of such a process is as a Pareto distribution. If we have a Pareto distribution with shape parameter <i>\u03b1</i>, and we have so far invested <i>z</i> resources without success, then we get:<p></p><p>(4) Chance of success from an extra unit of resources = <i>\u03b1</i>/<i>z</i>.</p><p>This is broadly in line with equation (3). In both cases the key term is a factor of 1/<i>z</i>. In each case there is also an additional factor, representing roughly how hard the problem is. In the case of the log-linear box, this depends on estimating an upper bound for the difficulty of the problem; in the case of the Pareto distribution it is handled by the shape parameter. It may be easier to introspect and extract a sensible estimate for the width of the box than for the shape parameter, since it is couched more in terms that we naturally understand.\n</p><h2 id=\"Further_work\">Further work</h2>\nIn this post, we\u2019ve just explored a simple model for the basic question of how likely success is at various stages. Of course it should not be used blindly, as you may often have more information than is incorporated into the model, but it represents a starting point if you don't know where to begin, and it gives us something explicit which we can discuss, critique, and refine.<p></p><p>In future posts, I plan to:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>Explore what happens in a field of related problems (such as a research field), and explain why we might expect to see logarithmic returns <i>ex post</i> as well as <i>ex ante</i>.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Look at some examples of this behaviour in the real world.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\t<li>Examine the counterfactual impact of investing resources working on these problems, since this is the standard we should be using to prioritise.</li>\n\t<li>Apply the framework to some questions of interest, with worked proof-of-concept calculations.</li>\n\t<li>Consider what happens if we relax some of the assumptions or take different models.</li>\n</ul><p></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "29th May 2014", "title": "Apples and oranges? Some initial thoughts on comparing diverse benefits", "author": "Katja_Grace", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>An important part of effective altruism is comparing the value of different altruistic endeavors. Many altruistic endeavors bring about different kinds of good things, for instance protection of children from incapacitating diseases, and extra years of quality education. To find the best causes, we need some way of evaluating these next to one another. How much extra education in the developing world is worth the same as an extra year of healthy life?</p><p>Answering such questions is notoriously tricky, and GWWC faces an even harder problem of answering them in such a way that other people are happy to use our judgements, and thus our recommendations. One can't just opt out of answering them, for the same reason one <a href=\"%E2%80%9Dhttp://80000hours.org/blog/4-estimation-is-the-best-we-have%E2%80%9D\">shouldn't</a> choose one\u2019s partner by their social security number just because it's hard to weigh up a good sense of humor against kind eyes.</p><p>So how can we make such evaluations? GWWC research has been looking into it a bit, and this blog post will tell you some of what we think. We\u2019ll look at various methods from economics and the social sciences, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches.</p><p>Any attempt to compare the value of two things has two basic parts. The first step is often to parcel out all of the main ways each item might have benefits. For instance, if a person in Malawi doesn\u2019t contract malaria next year, this will translate to various good things: less suffering and more joy for that person, less stress for their family, less congestion at the local hospital, a few thousand dollars of productive work, slightly different expectations among people nearby about how well their lives are likely to go.</p><p>This can go on for more steps - a few thousand dollars of productive work might be factored out in terms of increased prosperity for the family, and more prosperity spread among the wider world. Prosperity for the family might in turn be factored out as better nutrition for them, more education for their children, some investments that will bring them further prosperity, etc.</p><p>Another thing that often happens at this stage is that items are made more abstract. For instance one particular girl\u2019s recovery from schistosomiasis might be equated to some number of \u2018quality adjusted life years\u2019 or \u2018QALYs\u2019. This makes evaluation more tractable. Now we can evaluate many similar things at once, a little bit inaccurately, instead of doing thousands of different evaluations. For instance if we convert many different health interventions into QALYs saved, then we can compare a QALY to a year of school, and we automatically have a comparison of lots of different health interventions.</p><p>The second step is to actually compare the value of the items you end up with. This might involve for instance seeing how money much a person is willing to pay to avoid some suffering. You could do this by observing how much money and effort they invest in avoiding the flu, in flu season. Or you might ask them directly, \u2018if you could pay $1000 to avoid this surgery, would you take that offer?\u2019. Or instead of looking at money they will sacrifice, you might just ask about how they feel. For instance you might ask a blind person repeatedly over a period how satisfied they are with their life, and do the same with a person who is not blind.</p><p>Comparing value can be done immediately without the previous step of converting things, or after so many iterations of the previous step as to turn health and education into unrecognizable buckets of value. Many ways of comparing the value of A against B have been developed, especially in the social sciences. I have collected some of them into a <a href=\"%E2%80%9Dhttps://workflowy.com/shared/e666a215-f187-1af9-90dd-c81a3ab99789/%E2%80%9D\">menu</a>, which describes their upsides and downsides, and suggests when we might expect them to be most appropriate.</p><p>Note that the methods in the menu are generally comparing benefits to identifiable groups of people. We may care about people for whom it\u2019s hard to make these measurements, such as future generations, but we\u2019ll need different or further methodology to know how to compare these effects to the direct benefits we can measure. Nonetheless it\u2019s valuable to understand how we should compare diverse benefits today, and this may be a key component in a more general analysis.</p><p>Also, we won't usually be able to choose freely from the list of methods. GWWC will probably not have the resources to go and find out how much an additional parent improves the life outcomes for a person in rural China. The hope is rather that this list might help guide choices of comparison when a few different methods happen to be available. I\u2019ll give you a few examples of evaluation methods on the list, then in the rest of this post I'll describe some of key choices it offers and mention some of the factors that might suggest one choice over another.\n</p><h3 id=\"Appetizers\">Appetizers</h3>\nTo give you a concrete idea of what we are talking about, here are some examples of how we might use different methods from the list to figure out how good something is for a person:<p></p><p><b>Willingness to pay:</b> if a person is willing to pay $100 for a textbook, you can infer that they prefer having the textbook to having $100, and therefore to other things they could buy for $100.</p><p><b>Instantaneous reports of subjective wellbeing:</b> a person\u2019s phone pings them throughout the day and and asks something like, \u2018zero to ten, how good do you feel right now?\u2019 Using this method, we can build a hedonic profile for different individuals and (hopefully) discover the correlates and causes of happiness, as well as their relative importance.</p><p><b>The standard gamble:</b> A person is asked what probability of dying they would be willing to accept for an intervention that would improve their health in some way.</p><p><b>Averting behavior method:</b> Use the total costs people pay to avoid extra sunburn as a lower bound for how much a healthy ozone layer is worth to them.\n</p><h3 id=\"What_to_elicit__preferences__happiness__or_another_proxy_of_good_\">What to elicit: preferences, happiness, or another proxy of good?</h3>\nWhether you ultimately care to optimize for good feelings, people getting what they want, or something else is a controversial moral question. I won't address this question here except to note that different answers can lead us to prefer different measurement techniques. For instance, it is relatively easy to observe a person's preference by looking at which things they choose. Their happiness in different situations is harder to observe, so you might do better just asking them directly if that's what you care about. On the other hand, there are many reasons to suspect people's answers to 'how happy are you' across time and between people don't exactly correspond to the true landscape of happiness, so even if you cared about happiness you might take a person's preferences seriously, if you thought they liked to be happy.<p></p><p>When the situation you want to evaluate will have ramifications for other people than the one(s) directly affected, the preferences and feelings of the people involved will be a poor proxy for the overall good or bad done. For instance, suppose you are considering educating a young woman in a developing country. This should help her, but it is thought to also have large effects on her children and others in her community. If you are hoping to eventually lift her region out of poverty through this type of action, you are relying mostly on good from such indirect effects. In this case, discovering how much the woman would like to be educated is not very useful. Even if she wouldn't like to be educated at all it may be a good intervention. Similarly, if a person does not understand or care very much about their own future, their views on the value of improving it are not very useful. Asking a child how much they would like to be dewormed is not very useful.</p><p>One might deal with this in the earlier step, by equating 'one child dewormed' into a small amount of health, education, and physical development. A child might know better how much they dislike being sick, or adults may be able to shed light on the long term costs of malnourishment. Or you might just abstract a child's illness to be generic illness, and ask how much better informed people wish to avoid such illness.\n</p><h3 id=\"How_to_elicit__ask_or_observe_\">How to elicit: ask or observe?</h3>\nIn many situations what people think or say they value differs from what they choose given the opportunity. There are many possible reasons for this, from hypocrisy to difficulty envisaging the situation of interest accurately and without a biased focus. To the extent one believes a person's behavior better indicates their 'real' preferences, observing choices will be more accurate than asking. However a person's speech may better reflect their preferences on reflection than their behavior, which usually comprises a combination of considered preferences and unendorsed urges. If you wish to respect only the former, this is some reason to ask instead of observing.<p></p><p>Asking also has the benefit of making it relatively easy to isolate the issue of interest; natural situations rarely allow one to pin a preference to a specific factor, as so many factors change. For instance, if you see that parents choose to send their children to school at substantial cost, you might like to infer that they expect the education to benefit their children substantially. But it could also be that they expect their children to look poor if they don't go to school, and be treated worse. Then if the school didn't exist their children would not be worse off - they are just worse off if the school does exist, and they don't go to it.\n</p><h3 id=\"Who_to_elicit_it_from_\">Who to elicit it from?</h3>\nThe best people to evaluate A and B would seem to be people who have experienced both, and are currently either experiencing both or neither. This way they will hopefully be familiar with both items, and not too biased by the details of one being more salient at the moment.<p></p><p>Often it will be hard to find people in exactly that situation though. You will often have a trade off between people who are familiar with one item and not the other (so know more but might be biased) and people who are not familiar with either (so know little, but probably less biased).</p><p>This is all only an issue if you are interested in evaluating A and B for the person directly involved. If you want to know about the overall social benefits of fewer people being blind for instance, compared to fewer people being crippled, you may be better off asking someone who is neither blind nor crippled.\n</p><h3 id=\"Comparison_or_separate_evaluation_\">Comparison or separate evaluation?</h3>\nSuppose you want to know whether it is better to get a five year old to go to school for an extra year, or to avoid them getting malaria for one year, and you intend to figure it out by asking their parents. One way you could do it is to ask each parent 'do you think your child will be better off if she goes to school this year and gets malaria, or if she doesn't go to school or get malaria this year?'. Another is to ask some parents how valuable they think going to school is, and other parents how valuable they think avoiding malaria is, then comparing those values.<p></p><p>If you ask a person to compare two things at once, you will often get different answers to if you get them to just compare one or the other. One reason is that when they can see things side by side, they compare on the characteristics that seem salient. When they can only see one thing, they tend to ignore characteristics if they don't feel like they can get any grasp on how good the actual number for the characteristic is, even if it seems important. In our earlier example, suppose that for both the school and the health interventions, the parents are told how much extra income their child is likely to have in the future as a result of the project, and zero-to-ten how much their child will like it at the time. Suppose education will bring about much more future income than the health intervention on offer, but makes the child 2/10 happy instead of 8/10 happy. Then when the parents look at both interventions together, they might weigh up the present costs and future gains and choose the education intervention. When they look at the projects separately though, they might have fairly similar mental images of two different largish gains in future income, whereas happiness looks quite different on the given scale. So implicitly they focus more on the difference in happiness, and so the comparison could come out the other way.</p><p>***</p><p>These have been several of the considerations which make some evaluation methods more appropriate than others, at different times. The social science literature has a lot more to say. Hopefully our menu nonetheless summarizes enough important points to strengthen our research comparing interventions, and can be built upon in the future as we carry out such comparisons.</p><p><em>Crossposted from the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2014-05-22/apples-and-oranges-some-initial-thoughts-comparing-diverse-benefits\">Giving What We Can blog</a></em></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "24th Feb 2014", "title": "Ten ways to meet effective altruists", "author": "RyanCarey", "num_comments": "1 comment", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Meeting EAs is the most reliable way we know to gain information and motivation to do good. It's also enjoyable and fulfilling to connect with others whose brains work similarly to your own. The most valuable thing you can do right now is to send a few emails to some well-connected EAs. A small initial step can be the start of a network that delivers you friends and collaborators over a timescale of years.</p>\n<p>This month, Austin Parish asked on Facebook where he could find EA projects:</p>\n<blockquote>Hi all! I am a medical student with a quantitative/research background, and I deeply interested in effective altruism and rationalism. During the upcoming summer, I will be living in the D.C. area and I am looking for something to do (work, volunteering, research, interning) that will let me work to support either an effective altruism cause, or the movement of effective altruism itself.</blockquote>\n<p>In my experience, the surest path to sensible EA projects is linking in with other EAs. First, it will spawn a dialogue about the best projects. Second, it will facilitate movement-building. Third, it eases coordination.</p>\n<p>Most people focus on building a general-purpose network of EAs before zeroing in on a particular area of interest, and this is okay. Those who have a very specific project in mind can be better served by directing their attention and networking efforts in a more specific fashion that is not explored in this post.</p>\n<p>Even if you do not make any effort, EAs will occasionally email you out of the blue, and old friends will occasionally contact you about some interesting talk or EA blog post that they have seen. However, if these are the only EAs you know, then you are missing almost all of your opportunities. With these simple steps, you will not (necessarily) instantly discover a hidden EA community, but more effective altruists should gradually come to appear.</p>\n<p>Here is what Austin and you can do to meet EAs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1__Email_Giving_What_We_Can\">1. Email Giving What We Can</h2>\n<p>Email the Director of Community for Giving What We Can and ask them whether they knows any effective altruists near you. It's the job of the Director of Community for Giving What We Can to support local chapters to bring EAs together, and if they knows somebody, it is easy for them to send you an introductory email. In my experience, when I e-introduce EAs, it makes my day! It's usually the most impactful thing I do that week, so don't feel shy when you're really doing the EA community a favour.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2__Email_80_000_Hours\">2. Email 80,000 Hours</h2>\n<p>There are presently only a few <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/meet_the_team\">full-timers</a> at 80,000 Hours. Fortunately, they all know a lot of EAs and are happy to give an introduction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3__Email_The_Life_You_Can_Save\">3. Email The Life You Can Save</h2>\n<p>Contact <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/aboutus/contactus.aspx\">The Life You Can Save</a>\u00a0to meet any The Life You Can Save members in your area. As with all the other groups, they have to want to meet you too, but it's always good to ask!</p>\n<h2 id=\"4__Email_Mark_Lee\">4. Email Mark Lee</h2>\n<p>Mark Lee, who coordinates <a href=\"http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/\">The High Impact Network</a> and collaborates with <a href=\"/www.leverageresearch.com\">Leverage Research</a> and has many contacts who are interested in self-improvement and ambitious world-improving projects. <a href=\"http://mce_host/&lt;a%20href='mailto:info@thehighimpactnetwork.org'&gt;info@thehighimpactnetwork.org&lt;/a&gt;\">Contact Mark</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5__Check_for_LessWrong_meetups_in_your_area\">5. Check for LessWrong meetups in your area</h2>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/meetups/\">LessWrong</a> to check for upcoming meetups in your area. Just because your location doesn't have a lesswrong event coming up in the next few weeks, doesn't mean there isn't one. There might still be a mailing list or a community that you can find on the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/meetups/wi\">LessWrong meetup wiki page</a>. Ask Lesswrong members if they have other altruistic friends who would come to a Lesswrong meetup. Altruistic Lesswrong attendees are EAs until proven otherwise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6__Check_the_80_000_Hours_members_list_\">6. Check the 80,000 Hours members list:</h2>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130821030947/http://80000hours.org/members/all\">over 1000</a> 80,000 Hours members. To find members near you, press Ctrl-F to search your locality. 80,000 members are pretty awesome so just introduce yourself to anyone who lives near you, and to anyone who shares your interests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7__Use_Facebook\">7. Use Facebook</h2>\n<p>Join the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/\">Effective Altruism Facebook group</a>. When you see anybody write something interesting, introduce yourself and send them a friend request. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ryancarey1\">Add me</a>! Let me know what causes and projects you're interested in, and I will suggest you more friends. Add them! Look at their friends. Add everyone whose name you recognise, whether from an old blog post, a comment thread, a Youtube video or whatever, just add them! Add the mutual friends of all of these effective altruists until you get to a hundred. Your Facebook feed will feed your brain many more interesting ideas after you do this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8__Socialise_with_effective_altruists\">8. Socialise with effective altruists</h2>\n<p>When you meet nearby EAs, get them to introduce you their friends, and to other EAs. Meet them all. Listen to them; really listen. Ask them what can be done to improve the world. Introduce them to others with similar or complementary ideas. Ask for others to introduce you. Be yourself. Be likeable. Socialise. Enjoy yourself. Being around EAs is easy because EAs are awesome!</p>\n<h2 id=\"9__Find_groups_that_interest_you\">9. Find groups that interest you</h2>\n<p>Do you want to earn to give with a career in finance? Join the local university's finance club. To be a philosopher? Visit the philosophy club. Are you interested in AI? contact <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/team/\">MIRI</a>. Psychological improvement? Contact <a href=\"/www.leverageresearch.com\">Leverage</a>. Animal welfare? contact <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/about/meet-our-team/\">ACE</a>. Poverty and global health? Contact <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/contact\">Givewell</a>. In other areas, <a href=\"/www.facebook.com/ryancarey1\">I'm happy to help</a> you find research topics and collaborators.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10__Create_an_EA_meetup\">10. Create an EA meetup</h2>\n<p>The best magnet that you can create to attract EAs is a meetup. Remember that you will meet the most new awesome people (maybe 20% of them) at the first meetup that you do. The next meetup will have maybe 10%, the first speaker event will provide another 10%. Over the lifetime of your meetup group (months to years), you'll meet another 1-2% of the awesome people at each regular event. So for now, just focus on the first event. Not even the first public event - just the first time you get a few motivated effective altruists who didn't already know each other in a room together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Don't agonise over which branch of EA to represent, or promote the event, or design activities, or print business cards. Just pick a place - like a cafe, pick a time, gather a few friends and do it. Don't let anyone draw you into a conversation about making commitments to particular EA organisations, or creating an ongoing event. Just get people together to talk about what to do in the world, and that's your founding EA meetup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Now_make_the_most_of_it_\">Now make the most of it!</h2>\n<p>Next came EA Melbourne! Giving What We Can provided one of our cofounders, and two other organizers came from LessWrong, where we had also met each other. The rest of these steps gave us more than half of the rest of our attendees and contributors.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your mileage may vary, but this algorithm seems to be the best available. Hopefully Austin will make some new contacts in DC too, and you are already on your way to doing so elsewhere. So enjoy your new EA acquaintance! For anyone who tries out this algorithm, <a href=\"http://www.emailfuture.com/\">remind yourself</a> to contact me in a month to tell me how it has gone!</p>\n<p><em>Crossposted from Ryan Carey's <a href=\"http://careyryan.com/ten-simple-tricks-to-meet-effective-altruists-and-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next/\">blog</a></em></p></div></div>"},

{"date": "18th Aug 2014", "title": "Conversation with Holden Karnofsky, Nick Beckstead, and Eliezer Yudkowsky on the \"long-run\" perspective on effective altruism", "author": "Nick_Beckstead", "num_comments": "7 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Earlier this year, I had an email conversation with Holden Karnofsky, Eliezer Yudkowsky, and Luke Muehlhauser about future-oriented effective altruism, as a follow-up to an <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/2014/01/27/existential-risk-strategy-conversation-with-holden-karnofsky/\">earlier conversation</a> Holden had with Luke and Eliezer.</p><p>The conversation is now available <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/HK-NB-EY-LM-conversation-in-Feb-2014-1.1.pdf\">here</a>. My highlights from the conversation:</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>NICK: I think the case for \u201cdo the most good\u201d coinciding with \u201cdo what is best in terms of very long-term considerations\u201d rests on weaker normative premises than your conversation suggests it does. For example, I don\u2019t believe you need the assumption that creating a life is as good as saving a life, or a constant fraction as good as that. I have discussed a more general kind of argument\u2014as well as some of the most natural and common alternative moral frameworks I could think of\u2014in my dissertation (especially ch. 3 and ch. 5). It may seem like a small point, but I think you can introduce a considerable amount of complicated holistic evaluation into the framework without undermining the argument for focusing primarily on long-term considerations.</p><p>For another point, you can have trajectory changes or more severe \u201cflawed realizations\u201d that don\u2019t involve extinction. E.g., you could imagine a version of climate change where bad management of the problem results in the future being 1% worse forever or you could have a somewhat suboptimal AI that makes the future 1% worse than it could have been (just treat these as toy examples that illustrate a point rather than empirical claims). If you\u2019ve got a big enough future civilization, these changes could plausibly outweigh short-term considerations (apart from their long-term consequences) even if you don\u2019t think that creating a life is within some constant fraction of saving a life.</p><p>HOLDEN: On your first point - I think you're right about the *far future* but I have more trouble seeing the connection to *x-risk* (even broadly defined). Placing a great deal of value on a 1% improvement seems to point more in the direction of working toward broad empowerment/improvement and weigh toward e.g. AMF. I think I need to accept the creating/saving multiplier to believe that \"all the value comes from whether or not we colonize the stars.\"</p><p>NICK: The claim was explicitly meant to be about \"very long-term considerations.\" I just mean to be speaking to your hesitations about the moral framework (rather than your hesitations about what the moral framework implies).</p><p>I agree that an increased emphasis on trajectory changes/flawed realizations (in comparison with creating extra people) supports putting more emphasis on factors like broad human empowerment relative to avoiding doomsday scenarios and other major global disruptions.</p><p>ELIEZER: How does AMF get us to a 1% better *long-term* future?\u00a0 Are you\nenvisioning something along the lines of \"Starting with a 1% more prosperous Earth results in 1% more colonization and hence 1% more utility by the time the stars finally burn out\"?</p><p>HOLDEN: I guess so. A 1% better earth does a 1% better job in the SWH transition? I haven't thought about this much and don't feel strongly about what I said.</p><p>ELIEZER: SWH?</p><p>HOLDEN: Something Weird Happens - Eliezer's term for what I think he originally intended Singularity to mean (or how I interpret Singularity).</p><p>(will write more later)</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>NICK: I feel that the space between your take on astronomical waste and Bostrom\u2019s take is smaller than you recognize in this discussion and in discussions we\u2019ve had previously. In the grand scheme of things, it seems the position you articulated (under the assumptions that future generations matter in the appropriate way) puts you closer to Bostrom than it does to (say) 99.9% of the population. I think most outsiders would see this dispute as analogous to a dispute between two highly specific factions of Marxism or something. As Eliezer said, I think your disagreement is more about how to apply maxipok than whether maxipok is right (in the abstract).[\u2026]</p><p>I think there\u2019s an interesting analogy with the animal rights people. Suppose you hadn\u2019t considered the long-run consequences of helping people so much and you become convinced that animal suffering on factory farms is of comparable importance to billions of humans being tortured and killed each year, and that getting one person to be a vegetarian is like preventing many humans from being tortured and killed. Given that you accept this conclusion, I think it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for you to update strongly in favor of factory farming being one of the most high priority areas for doing good in the world, even if you didn\u2019t know a great deal about RFMF and so on. Anyway, it does seem pretty analogous in some important ways. This looks to me like a case where some animal rights people did something analogous to the process you critiqued and thereby identified factory farming,</p><p>HOLDEN: Re: Bostrom's essay - I see things differently. I see \"the far future is extremely important\" as a reasonably mainstream position. There are a lot of mainstream people who place substantial value on funding and promoting science, for that exact reason. Certainly there are a lot of people who don't feel this way, and I have arguments with them, but I don't feel Bostrom's essay tells us nearly as much when read as agreeing with me. I'd say it gives us a framework that may or may not turn out to be useful.</p><p>So far I haven't found it to be particularly useful. I think valuing extinction prevention as equivalent to saving something like 5*N lives (N=current global population) leads to most of the same conclusions. Most of my experience with Bostrom's essay has been people pointing to it as a convincing defense of a much more substantive position.</p><p>I think non-climate-change x-risks are neglected because of how diffuse their constituencies are (the classic issue), not so much because of apathy toward the far future, particularly not from failure to value the far future at [huge number] instead of 5*N.</p><p>NICK: [\u2026] Though I'm not particularly excited about refuges, they might be a good test case. I think that if you had this 5N view, refuges would be obviously dumb but if you had the view that I defended in my dissertation then refuges would be interesting from a conceptual perspective.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p>HOLDEN: One of the things I'm hoping to clarify with my upcoming posts is that my comfort with a framework is not independent of what the framework implies. Many of the ways in which you try to break down arguments do not map well onto my actual process for generating conclusions.</p><p>NICK: I'm aware that this isn't how you operate. But doesn't this seem like an \"in the trenches\" case where we're trying to learn and clarify our reasoning, and therefore your post would suggest that now is a good time to do engage in sequence thinking?</p><p>HOLDEN: Really good question that made me think and is going to make me edit my post. I concede that sequence thinking has important superiorities for communication; I also think that it COULD be used to build a model of cluster thinking (this is basically what I tried to do in my post - define cluster thinking as a vaguely specified \"formula\"). One of the main goals of my post is to help sequence thinkers do a better job modeling and explicitly discussing what cluster thinking is doing.</p><p>What's frustrating to me is getting accused of being evasive, inconsistent, or indifferent about questions like this far future thing; I'd rather be accused of using a process that is hard to understand by its nature (and shouldn't be assumed to be either rational or irrational; it could be either or a mix).</p><p>Anyway, what I'd say in this case is:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>I think we've hit diminishing returns on examining this particular model of the far future. I've named all the problems I see with it; I have no more. I concede that this model doesn't have other holes that I've identified, for the moment. I've been wrong before re: thinking we've hit diminishing returns before we have, so I'm open to more questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>In terms of how I integrate the model into my decisions, I cap its signal and give it moderate weight. \"Action X would be robustly better if I accepted this model of the far future\" is an argument in favor of action X but not a decisive one. This is the bit that I've previously had trouble defending as a principled action, and hopefully I've made some progress on that front. I don't intend this statement to cut off discussion on the sequence thinking bit, because more argument along those lines could strengthen the robustness of the argument for me and increase its weight.</li>\n</ul>\nHOLDEN: Say that you buy Apple stock because \"there's a 10% chance that they develop a wearable computer over the next 2 years and this sells over 10x as well as the iPad has.' I short Apple stock because \"I think their new CEO sucks.\" IMO, it is the case that you made a wild guess about the probability of the wearable computer thing, and it is not the case that I did.<p></p><p>NICK: I think I've understood your perspective for a while, I'm mainly talking about how to explain it to people.</p><p>I think this example clarifies the situation. If your P(Apple develops a wearable computer over the next 2 years and this sells over 10x as well as the iPad has) = 10%, then you'd want to buy apple stock. In this sense, if you short Apple stock, you're committed to P(Apple develops a wearable computer over the next 2 years and this sells over 10x as well as the iPad has) &lt; 10%. In this sense, you often can't get out of being committed to ranges of subjective probabilities.</p><p>The way you think about it, the cognitive procedure is more like: ask a bunch of questions, give answers to the questions, give weights to your question/answer pairs, make a decision as a result. You're \"relying on an assumption\" only if that assumption is your answer to one of the questions and you put a lot of weight on that question/answer pair. Since you just relied on the pair (How good is the CEO?, The CEO sucks), you didn't rely on a wild guess about P(Apple develops a wearable computer over the next 2 years and this sells over 10x as well as the iPad has). And, in this sense, you can often avoid being committed to subjective probabilities.</p><p>When I first heard you say, \"You're relying on a wild guess,\" my initial reaction was something like, \"Holden is making the mistake of thinking that his actions don't commit him to ranges of subjective probabilities (in the first sense). It looks like he hasn't thought through the Bayesian perspective on this.\" I do think this is a real mistake that people make, though they may (often?) be operating more on the kind of basis you have described . I started thinking you had a more interesting perspective when, when I was pressing you on this point, you said something like, \"I'm committed to whatever subjective probability I'm committed to on the basis of the decision that's an outcome of this cognitive procedure.\"</p></div></div>"},

{"date": "23rd Jul 2014", "title": "Ben Kuhn on the effective altruist movement", "author": "admin3", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Ben Kuhn is a data scientist and engineer at a small financial technology firm. He previously studied mathematics and computer science at Harvard, where he was also co-president of <a href=\"http://harvardea.org/\">Harvard College Effective Altruism</a>. He writes on effective altruism and other topics at <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/\">his website</a>.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><p><b>Pablo</b>: How did you become involved in the EA movement?</p><p><b>Ben</b>: When I was a sophomore in high school (that's age 15 for non-Americans), Peter Singer gave his <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\"><i>The Life You Can Save</i></a> talk at <a href=\"http://commschool.org/\">my high school</a>. He went through his whole \"child drowning in the pond\" spiel and explained that we were morally obligated to give money to charities that helped those who were worse off than us. In particular, I think at that point he was recommending donating to Oxfam in a sort of Kantian way where you gave an amount of money such that if everyone gave the same percentage it would eliminate world poverty. My friends and I realized that there was no utilitarian reason to stop at that amount of money--you should just donate everything that you didn't need to survive.</p><p>So, being not only sophomores but also sophomoric, we decided that since Prof. Singer didn't live in a cardboard box and wear only burlap sacks, he must be a hypocrite and therefore not worth paying attention to.</p><p>Sometime in the intervening two years I ran across Yvain's essay <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/\"><i>Efficient Charity: Do Unto Others</i></a> and through it <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>. I think that was the point where I started to realize Singer might have been onto something. By my senior year (ages 17-18) I at least professed to believe pretty strongly in some version of effective altruism, although I think I hadn't heard of the term yet. I wrote <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bknet/on_charity.pdf\">an essay</a> on the subject in a publication that my writing class put together. It was anonymous (under the brilliant <i>nom de plume</i> of \"Jenny Ross\") but somehow my classmates all figured out it was me.</p><p>The next big update happened during the spring of my first year of Harvard, when I started going to the Cambridge Less Wrong meetups and met <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/index\">Jeff</a> and <a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/\">Julia</a>. Through some chain of events they set me up with the folks who were then running Harvard High-Impact Philanthropy (which later became <a href=\"http://harvardea.org/\">Harvard Effective Altruism</a>). After that spring, almost everyone else involved in HHIP left and I ended up becoming president. At that point I guess I counted as \"involved in the EA movement\", although things were still touch-and-go for a while until John Sturm came onto the scene and made HHIP get its act together and actually do things.</p><p><b>Pablo</b>: In spite of being generally sympathetic to EA ideas, you have recently written a thorough <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/ea-critique\">critique of effective altruism</a>. \u00a0I'd like to ask you a few questions about some of the objections you raise in that critical essay. \u00a0First, you have drawn a distinction between pretending to try and actually trying. \u00a0Can you tell us what you mean by this, and why do you claim that a lot of effective altruism can be summarized as \u201cpretending to actually try\u201d?</p><p><b>Ben</b>: I'm not sure I can explain better than what I wrote in that post, but I'll try to expand on it. For reference, here's the excerpt that you referred to:</p><p>By way of clarification, consider a distinction between two senses of the word \u201ctrying\u201d.... Let\u2019s call them \u201cactually trying\u201d and \u201cpretending to try\u201d. Pretending to try to improve the world is something like responding to social pressure to improve the world by querying your brain for a thing which improves the world, taking the first search result and rolling with it. For example, for a while I thought that I would try to improve the world by developing computerized methods of checking informally-written proofs, thus allowing more scalable teaching of higher math, democratizing education, etc. Coincidentally, computer programming and higher math happened to be the two things that I was best at. This is pretending to try. Actually trying is looking at the things that improve the world, figuring out which one maximizes utility, and then doing that thing. For instance, I now run an effective altruist student organization at Harvard because I realized that even though I\u2019m a comparatively bad leader and don\u2019t enjoy it very much, it\u2019s still very high-impact if I work hard enough at it. This isn\u2019t to say that I\u2019m actually trying yet, but I\u2019ve gotten closer.</p><p>Most people say they want to improve the world. Some of them say this because they actually want to improve the world, and some of them say this because they want to be perceived as the kind of person who wants to improve the world. Of course, in reality, everyone is motivated by other people's perceptions to some extent--the only question is by how much, and how closely other people are watching. But to simplify things let's divide the world up into those two categories, \"altruists\" and \"signalers.\"</p><p>If you're a signaler, what are you going to do? If you don't try to improve the world at all, people will notice that you're a hypocrite. On the other hand, improving the world takes lots of resources that you'd prefer to spend on other goals if possible. But fortunately, looking like you're improving the world is easier than actually improving the world. Since people usually don't do a lot of due diligence, the kind of improvements that signallers make tend to be ones with very good appearances and surface characteristics--like <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/southernafrica904/video_index.html\">PlayPumps</a>, water-pumping merry-go-rounds which initially appeared to be a clever and elegant way to solve the problem of water shortage in developing countries. PlayPumps got tons of money and celebrity endorsements, and their creators got lots of social rewards, even though the pumps turned out to be hideously expensive, massively inefficient, prone to breaking down, and basically a disaster in every way.</p><p>So in this oversimplified world, the EA observation that \"charities vary in effectiveness by orders of magnitude\" is explained by \"charities\" actually being two different things: one group optimizing for looking cool, and one group optimizing for actually doing good. A large part of effective altruism is realizing that signaling-charities (\"pretending to try\") often don't do very much good compared to altruist-charities.</p><p>(In reality, of course, everyone is driven by some amount of signalling and some amount of altruism, so these groups overlap substantially. And there are other motivations for running a charity, like being able to convince <i>yourself</i> that you're doing good. So it gets messier, but I think the vastly oversimplified model above is a good illustration of where my point is coming from.)</p><p>Okay, so let's move to the second paragraph of the post you referenced:</p><p>Using this distinction between pretending and actually trying, I would summarize a lot of effective altruism as \u201cpretending to actually try\u201d. As a social group, effective altruists have successfully noticed the pretending/actually-trying distinction. But they seem to have stopped there, assuming that knowing the difference between fake trying and actually trying translates into ability to actually try. Empirically, it most certainly doesn\u2019t. A lot of effective altruists still end up satisficing\u2014finding actions that are on their face acceptable under core EA standards and then picking those which seem appealing because of other essentially random factors. This is more likely to converge on good actions than what society does by default, because the principles are better than society\u2019s default principles. Nevertheless, it fails to make much progress over what is directly obvious from the core EA principles. As a result, although \u201cdoing effective altruism\u201d feels like truth-seeking, it often ends up being just a more credible way to pretend to try.</p><p>The observation I'm making here is roughly that EA seems not to have switched entirely to doing good for altruistic rather than signaling reasons. It's more like we've switched to <i>signaling</i> that we're doing good for altruistic rather than signaling reasons. In other words, the motivation didn't switch from \"looking good to outsiders\" to \"actually being good\"--it switched from \"looking good to outsiders\" to \"looking good to the EA movement.\"</p><p>Now, the EA movement is way better than random outsiders at distinguishing between things with good surface characteristics and things that are actually helpful, so the latter criterion is much stricter than the former, and probably leads to much more good being done per dollar. (For instance, I doubt the EA community would ever endorse something like PlayPumps.) But, at least at the time of writing that post, I saw a lot of behavior that seemed to be based on finding something pleasant and with good surface appearances rather than finding the thing that optimized utility--for instance, donating to causes without a particularly good case that they were better than saving or picking career options that seemed decent-but-not-great from an EA perspective. That's the source of the phrase \"pretending to actually try\"--the signaling isn't going away, it's just moving up a level in the hierarchy, to signaling that you don't care about signaling.</p><p>Looking back on that piece, I think \u201cpretending to actually try\u201d is still a problem, but my intuition is now that it's probably not huge in the scheme of things. I'm not quite sure why that is, but here are some arguments against it being very bad that have occurred to me:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>It's probably somewhat less prevalent than I initially thought, because the EAs making weird-seeming decisions may be doing them for reasons that aren't transparent to me and that get left out by the typical EA analysis. The typical EA analysis tends to be a 50000-foot average-case argument that can easily be invalidated by particular personal factors.</li>\n\t<li>As Katja Grace <a href=\"http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2013/12/22/pretend-to-really-really-try/\">points out</a>, encouraging pretending to really try might be optimal from a movement-building perspective, inasmuch as it's somewhat inescapable and still leads to pretty good results.</li>\n\t<li>I probably overestimated the extent to which motivated/socially-pressured life choices are bad, for a couple reasons. I discounted the benefit of having people do a diversity of things, even if the way they came to be doing those things wasn't purely rational. I also discounted the cost of doing something EA tells you to do instead of something you also want to do.</li>\n\t<li>For instance, suppose for the sake of argument that there's a pretty strong EA case that politics isn't very good (I know this isn't actually true). It's probably good for marginal EAs to be dissuaded from going into politics by this, but I think it would still be bad for every single EA to be dissuaded from going into politics, for two reasons. First, the arguments against politics might turn out to be wrong, and having a few people in politics hedges against that case. Second, it's much easier to excel at something you're motivated at, and the category of \"people who are excellent at what they do\" is probably as important to the EA movement as \"people doing job X\" for most X.</li>\n</ul>\nI also just haven't noticed as much pretending-stuff going on in the last few months, so maybe we're just getting better at avoiding it (or maybe I'm getting worse at noticing it). Anyway, I still definitely think there's pretending-to-actually-try going on, but I don't think it's a huge problem.<p></p><p><b>Pablo</b>: In another section of that critique, you express surprise at the fact that so many effective altruists donate to global health causes now. \u00a0Why would you expect EAs to use their money in other ways--whether it's donating now to other causes, or donating later--, and what explains, in your opinion, this focus on causes for which we have relatively good data?</p><p><b>Ben</b>; I'm no longer sure enough of where people's donations are going to say with certainty that too much is going to global health. My update here is from of a combination of being overconfident when I wrote the piece, and what looks like an increase in waiting to donate shortly after I wrote it. The latter was probably due in large part to <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/26/change-in-against-malaria-foundation-recommendation-status-room-for-more-funding-related/\">AMF's delisting</a> and perhaps the precedent set by <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/12/staff-members-personal-donations/\">GiveWell employees</a>, many of whom waited last year (though <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/31/some-considerations-against-saving-for-next-year/\">others argued against it</a>). (Incidentally, I'm excited about the projects going on to make this more transparent, e.g. the questions on the survey about giving!)</p><p>The giving now vs. later debate has been <a href=\"/ea/4e/giving_now_vs_later_a_summary/\">ably summarized by Julia Wise</a> on the EA blog. My sense from reading various arguments for both sides is that I more often see bad arguments for giving now. There are definitely good arguments for giving at least some money now, but on balance I suspect I\u2019d like to see more saving. Again, though, I don\u2019t have a great idea of what people\u2019s donation behavior actually is; my samples could easily be biased.</p><p>I think my strongest impression right now is that I suspect we should be exploring more different ways to use our donations. For instance, some people who are earning to give have experimented with funding people to do independent research, which was a pretty cool idea. Off the top of my head, some other things we could try include scholarships, essay contest prizes, career assistance for other EAs, etc. In general it seems like there are tons of ways to use money to improve the world, many of which haven\u2019t been explored by GiveWell or other evaluators and many of which don\u2019t even fall in the category of things they care about (because they\u2019re too small or too early-stage or something), but we should still be able to do something about them.</p><p><b>Pablo</b>: In the concluding section of your essay, you propose that <i>self-awareness</i> be added to the list of principles that define effective altruism. Any thoughts on how to make the EA movement more self-aware?</p><p><b>Ben</b>: One thing that I like to do is think about what our blind spots are. I think it's pretty easy to look at all the stuff that is obviously a bad idea from an EA point of view, and think that our main problem is getting people \"on board\" (or even \"getting people to admit they're wrong\") so that they stop doing obviously bad ideas. And that's certainly helpful, but we also have a ways to go just in terms of figuring things out.</p><p>For instance, here's my current list of blind spots--areas where I wish there were a lot more thinking and idea-spreading going on then there currently is:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li><b>Being a good community.</b> The EA community is already having occasional growing pains, and this is only going to get worse as we gain steam e.g. with Will MacAskill's upcoming book. And beyond that, I think that ways of making groups more effective (as opposed to individuals) have a lot of promise for making the movement better at what we do. Many, many intellectual groups fail to accomplish their goals for basically silly reasons, while seemingly much worse groups do much better on this dimension. It seems like there\u2019s no intrinsic reason we should be worse than, say, Mormons at building an effective community, but we\u2019re clearly not there yet. I think there\u2019s absolutely huge value in getting better at this, yet almost no one putting in a serious concerted effort.</li>\n\t<li><b>Knowing history.</b> Probably as a result of EA's roots in math/philosophy, my impression is that our average level of historical informedness is pretty low, and that this makes us miss some important pattern-matches and cues. For instance, I think a better knowledge of history could help us think about capacity-building interventions, policy advocacy, and community building.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>Fostering more intellectual diversity.</b> Again because of the math/philosophy/utilitarianism thing, we have a massive problem with intellectual monoculture. Of my friends, the ones I enjoy talking about altruism the most with now are largely actually the ones who associate least with the broader EA community, because they have more interesting and novel perspectives.<b>\n</b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Finding individual effective opportunities</strong>. I suspect that there\u2019s a lot of room for good EA opportunities that GiveWell hasn\u2019t picked up on because they\u2019re specific to a few people at a particular time. Some interesting stuff has been done in this vein in the past, like funding small EA-related experiments, funding people to do independent secondary research, or giving loans to other EAs investing in themselves (at least I believe this has been done). But I\u2019m not sure if most people are adequately on the lookout for this kind of opportunity.</li>\n</ul>\n(Since it's not fair to say \"we need more X\" without specifying how we get it, I should probably also include at least one anti-blind spots that I think we should be spending fewer resources on, on the margin: Object-level donations to e.g. global health causes. I feel like we may be hitting diminishing returns here. Probably donating some is important for signalling reasons, but I think it doesn't have a very high naive expected value right now.)<p></p><p><b>Pablo</b>: Finally, what are your plans for the mid-term future? \u00a0What EA-relevant activities will you engage in over the next few years, and what sort of impact do you expect to have?</p><p><b>Ben</b>: A while ago I did some reflecting and realized that most of the things I did that I was most happy about were pretty much unplanned--they happened not because I carefully thought things through and decided that they were the best way to achieve some goal, but because they intuitively seemed like a cool thing to do. (Things in this category include starting a blog, getting involved in the EA/rationality communities, running Harvard Effective Altruism, getting my current job, etc.) As a result, I don't really have \"plans for the mid-term future\" per se. Instead, I typically make decisions based on intuitions/heuristics about what will lead to the best opportunities later on, without precisely knowing (or even knowing at all, often) what form those opportunities will take.</p><p>So I can't tell you what I'll be doing for the next few years--only that it will probably follow some of my general intuitions and heuristics:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li><b>Do lots of things</b>. The more things I do, the more I increase my \"luck surface area\" to find awesome opportunities.</li>\n\t<li><b>Do a few things really well</b>. The point of this heuristic is hopefully obvious.</li>\n\t<li><b>Do things that other people aren't doing</b>--or more accurately, things that not enough people are doing relative to how useful or important they are. My effort is most likely to make a difference in an area that is relatively under-resourced.</li>\n</ul>\nI\u2019d like to take a moment here to plug the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/altruistic-career-choice\">conference call on altruistic career choice</a> that Holden Karnofsky of GiveWell had, which makes some great specific points along these lines.<p></p><p>Anyway, that's my long-winded answer to the first part of this question. As far as EA-relevant activities and impacts, all the same caveats apply as above, but I can at least go over some things I'm currently interested in:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>Now that I\u2019m employed full-time, I need to start thinking much harder about where exactly I want to give: both what causes seem best, and which interventions within those causes. I actually currently don't have much of a view on what I would do with more unrestricted funds.</li>\n\t<li>Related to the point above about self-awareness, I'm interested in learning some more EA-relevant history--how previous social movements have worked out, how well various capacity-building interventions have worked, more about policy and the various systems that philanthropy comes into contact with, etc.</li>\n\t<li>I'm interested to see to what extent the success of Harvard Effective Altruism can be sustained at Harvard and replicated at other universities.</li>\n</ul>\nI also have some more speculative/gestational interests--I'm keeping my eye on these, but don't even have concrete next steps in mind:\n<ul>\n\t<li>I think there may be under-investment in healthy EA community dynamics, preventing common failure modes like unfriendliness, ossification to new ideas, groupthink etc.--though I can't say for sure because I don't have a great big-picture perspective of the EA community.</li>\n\t<li>I'm also interested in generally adding more intellectual/epistemic diversity to EA--we have something of a monoculture problem right now. Anecdotally, there are a number of people who I think would have a really awesome perspective on many problems that we face, but who get turned off of the community for one reason or another.</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://www.stafforini.com/blog/ben-kuhn-on-the-effective-altruist-movement/\">Pablo's blog</a></em><p></p></div></div>"},

For example, Joey Savoie and Xio Kikauka's interviewed 42 often highly active EAs over Skype, and found that they generally had left-leaning parents, donated on average 10%, and were altruistic before becoming EAs.

However, it seems likely that one charity is (in expectation) better than the rest, and that the extra good done by my donating to it rather than the alternatives will be truly important - an extra life saved, or a huge difference to the recipients\u2019 welfare. Just as the enormity of the good I could do moved me to pledge to donate 10% of my income, so it calls for putting real effort into picking the best charity - something I haven\u2019t done enough in previous years.</p>\n<p>This makes it a shame that GiveWell don\u2019t pick out the charity that they think does most good, radically uncertain though this choice would be. However, it\u2019s a choice that\u2019s forced on their staff when they make their individual donations, and fortunately GiveWell have published where these go. A clear majority donate to <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly\">GiveDirectly</a>, and this carries great weight, as I trust GiveWell researchers\u2019 ability to pick charities far more than I do my own. So GiveDirectly is a strong candidate. It has many qualities I value highly: straightforward counterfactual impact; an RCT demonstrating significant improvements in the lives of its beneficiaries; and a simple and clear model for doing good, without too many speculative or poorly-evidenced steps.</p>\n<p>However, it has these qualities at the cost of doing slightly less good than some other candidates for my donations, at least on certain expected value calculations. I\u2019m conscious of the weaknesses of these calculations, but in the case of the <a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/recommended-charities/amf-further-information\">Against Malaria Foundation</a> in particular they provide a persuasive case in favour of its doing more good than GiveDirectly. If they\u2019re even roughly correct, I\u2019d save several lives if I donated \u00a35,000 to AMF this year. That\u2019s an awe-inspiring ability to have, and seems better than sending that money to the poor households to which GiveDirectly would grant it, despite the enormous difference I know that would make.</p>\n<p>So my current top choice would be AMF. As many readers will know, GiveWell recently <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/26/change-in-against-malaria-foundation-recommendation-status-room-for-more-funding-related/\">ceased recommending it</a> on the grounds that it currently lacks room for more funding, not having arranged enough bednet distributions to use up its substantial reserves. But this concern may be addressed within three or perhaps six months, as large distributions are currently being negotiated; Giving What We Can continues to recommend AMF for this very reason. Given this, I plan to give to AMF if it gains clear room for more funding over the next six months, and otherwise seriously consider donating to GiveDirectly.</p>\n<p>This is a provisional choice, as I\u2019m constantly learning and thinking about where my donations can do the most good. (For example, I\u2019m open to the argument that I could help people more through indirect means; I\u2019m currently talking to GiveWell about the possibility of donating to them, as this might ultimately cause larger donations to first-order charities than my own.) \u00a0I\u2019d love to hear readers\u2019 comments on my reasoning, as if there\u2019s a better giving opportunity I\u2019d very much want to know about it!</p></div></div>"},

We were covered in Fast Company -- twice -- the Wall Street Journal, and The Reasoner. Other mentions include Forbes, Big Think, Boing Boing, and Lifehacker. We\u2019ve also had some interest in potential training for tech companies. Our curriculum is gaining a second tier in the form of alumni workshops.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On ongoing aims:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\"CFAR seems to many of us to be among the efforts most worth investing in. \u00a0This isn\u2019t because our present workshops are all that great. \u00a0Rather, it is because, in terms of \u201csaving throws\u201d one can buy for a humanity that may be navigating tricky situations in an unknown future, improvements to thinking skill seem to be one of the strongest and most robust. \u00a0And we suspect that CFAR is a promising kernel from which to help with that effort.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>As noted, we aim in 2015 to get all the way to a \u201cfull prototype\u201d -- \u00a0a point from which we are actually visibly helping in the aimed-for way. \u00a0This will be a tricky spot to get to. Our experience slowly coming to grips with epistemic rationality is probably more rule than the exception, and I suspect we\u2019ll run into a number of curve balls on path to the prototype.\"</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>All of these are covered in a bunch more detail in the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lfg/cfar_in_2014_continuing_to_climb_out_of_the/\">full article</a>.</div></div></div>"},

It's intended to give a very rough flavour of what was discussed, not as accurate or complete minutes.</p>\n<p>Attendance: 4 (snowy weather may have reduced attendance somewhat)</p>\n<p>This was the first Toronto EA meetup for over a year. I'm no longer branding it as a \"THINK\" meeting, but I'm still reusing the THINK meetup group. It was held in my apartment.</p>\n<p><a></a>We started the discussion on the effectiveness of Oxfam.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GiveWell are <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/charities/Oxfam\">decidedly lukewarm about them</a></li>\n<li>The Life You Can Save <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Where-to-Donate/Oxfam\">like them</a></li>\n<li>They have goals that are hard to measure, e.g. education, lobbying</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oxfam certainly <a href=\"http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/effectiveness-review-summary-of-201213-findings-and-key-lessons-learned-314397\">evaluate the impact of some of their programs</a>.</p>\n<p>But there's a contrast between this and a more data-driven approach, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a>. I described a data driven approach as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scientific studies measure the relationship between some intervention and some outcome we actually care about (e.g. lifespan, health outcomes)</li>\n<li>Orgs measure something that's easier to measure, e.g. counting the number of interventions</li>\n<li>From this and the original study we can estimate the impact the org is having</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data driven approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advantages: Reduces amount of work needed for donors to decide?</li>\n<li>Disadvantages: Paucity of data, Most people don't have skillset to apply data driven approach</li>\n<li>(we came up with some others as well but I didn't record them)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The issue came up: How do I know which authorities to listen to?

It's a small percentage of the population to start with, and orgs are likely made up of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>people who care about the project</li>\n<li>people who know about business and managing donors</li>\n<li>specialists with knowledge about projects (these are the most likely to be good at data). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why would priorities of large donors conflict with chasing effectiveness?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>relationship development</li>\n<li>whatever's in vogue (e.g. viewing organisations as businesses)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We talked about Oxfam and MIRI (I never thought I'd be lumping those two together!) as examples of orgs working on something speculative with hard-to-measure impact.

Or what this even means.</p>\n<p>Indeed, many people don\u2019t think it\u2019s even possible to work this out!\u00a0We don\u2019t agree. However, we think that if you don\u2019t try to weigh up your options, you\u2019ll end up doing far less for the world than you could otherwise be doing.</p>\n<p>How, then, do we go about helping you decide in which career can you make the most difference? It\u2019s not an easy question, but it is a fascinating one that has a great deal of importance to the world.</p>\n<h1 id=\"What_factors_are_the_most_important_\">What factors are the most important?</h1>\n<p>After talking one-on-one with around 100 people about their careers, asking people who have made a big impact, and thinking through what matters, we\u2019ve developed a simple framework for assessing the value of different careers.</p>\n<p>We expect this framework will develop significantly and become more precise over time as we come to gain a better grasp over which factors matter. It just represents our best guess at which key factors are most important, organised in a way that we\u2019ve found relatively easy to understand and evaluate separately.</p>\n<p>In summary, we find it useful to judge careers on two key factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Immediate Impact</li>\n<li>Building career capital</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We break immediate impact down further into: the size of your contribution multiplied by the effectiveness of the cause you work on.</p>\n<p>We break career capital down into: skills, network and CV points.</p>\n<p>In the rest of this post, I\u2019ll go over these factors in more detail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1__Immediate_Impact\">1) Immediate Impact</h2>\n<p>This is the immediate scope you have to make the world a better place through this career over the next couple of years.</p>\n<p>We break this down into the multiple of two further factors: Impact = Contribution x Cause Effectiveness</p>\n<h3 id=\"a__Contribution\"><span>a) Contribution</span></h3>\n<p>In some careers, you have more ability to contribute to important problems than others. Simply put, Presidents are more influential than sandwich makers. There are many ways to contribute to a cause, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gaining a public platform and using it to spread an important idea </li>\n<li>Gaining a network and using it to spread an idea or carry out a project </li>\n<li>Donating money </li>\n<li>Influencing budgets in existing organizations or by building a new organization </li>\n<li>In addition, there\u2019s the direct contribution you make through your work</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\u2019s often useful to assess careers on how much contribution you\u2019ll be able to make along each of these dimensions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"b__Cause_effectiveness\">b) Cause effectiveness</h3>\n<p>To make a big difference, you\u2019ll want to work on the problems where your contribution will go as far as possible. These are problems which are both important - worth doing something about - and tractable - it\u2019s possible to do something about them. We call these effective causes.</p>\n<p>The relation seems to be multiplicative. If your contribution increases by 10x, then so does your impact. Likewise with the effectiveness of your cause.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2__Building_Career_Capital\">2) Building Career Capital</h2>\n<p>This is the extent to which the career path builds your general ability to take high impact opportunities in the future.</p>\n<p>For most people, it is very hard to figure out what projects they will be working on beyond 3 \u2013 5 years, and so we don\u2019t find it very useful to try to evaluate the impact of these projects. Rather, we prefer to evaluate individuals\u2019 general potential to have an impact. We call this career capital.</p>\n<p>Your long-term general potential is often more important than your immediate impact. Most careers only peak after around 20 years<a href=\"#_ftn2\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup>[2]</sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> - you\u2019ll be having more impact when you manage the charity rather than intern for it. Developing your career capital may be preferable to acting directly because your knowledge of which cause is most important are very likely to change.</p>\n<p>We break down career capital into the quality of your network, skills and CV.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a__Network\"><span>a) Network</span></h3>\n<p>Getting a job often depends on who you know. So if you know more influential people, you may have more valuable employment options.

This was enough to get us interested in understanding the area better, so we asked David Goll, a Giving What We Can member and a professional economist, to investigate how it compares to our existing recommendations.</em> --\u00a0<strong>Owen Cotton-Barratt, Director of Research for Giving What We Can</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Around one in every eight people suffers from chronic hunger, according to the Food and Agricultural Organisation\u2019s most recent estimates (FAO, 2013). Two billion suffer from micronutrient deficiencies. One quarter of children are stunted. Increasing agricultural yields and therefore availability of food will be essential in tackling these problems, which are likely to get worse as population and income growth place ever greater pressure on supply. To some extent, yield growth can be achieved through improved use of existing technologies. Access to and use of irrigation, fertilizer and agricultural machinery remains limited in some developing countries. However, targeted research and development will also be required to generate new technologies (seeds, animal vaccines and so on) that allow burgeoning food demand to be met.</p><p>Agricultural research and development encompasses an extremely broad range of activities and potential innovations. A 2008 paper issued by Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (von Braun et al., 2008), an international organization that funds and coordinates agricultural research, identifies 14 \u2018best bets\u2019. These include developing hybrid and inbred seeds with improved yield potential, better resistance to wheat rust, increased drought tolerance and added nutritional value, but also encompasses the development new animal vaccines, better fertilizer use and improved processing and management techniques for fisheries.</p><p>Notable successes in seed development seem to have generated immense social benefit. The high-yielding varieties that spread through the \u2018Green Revolution\u2019 are often credited with driving a doubling of rice and wheat yields in Asia from the late 60s to the 90s, saving hundreds of millions of people people from famine (see, for instance, Economist, 2014). Given the prevalence of hunger and the high proportion of the extremely poor that work as farmers, agricultural research and development seems to offer a potential opportunity for effective altruism.</p><p>Existing benefit-cost estimates are promising, though not spectacular. The Copenhagen Consensus project ranked R&amp;D to increase yield enhancements as the sixth most valuable social investment available, behind deworming and micronutrient interventions but ahead of popular programmes such as conditional cash transfers for education (Copenhagen Consensus, 2012).</p><p>The calculations that fed into this decision were based on two main categories of benefit. First, higher yield seeds allow production of larger quantities of agricultural output at a lower cost, bolstering the income of farmers. Around 70 per cent of the African labour-force work in agriculture, many in smallholdings that generate little income above subsistence (IFPRI, 2012). Boosting gains from agriculture could clearly provide large benefits for many of the worst off. Second, decreased costs of production lead to lower prices for food, allowing consumers to purchase more or freeing up their income to be spent elsewhere.</p><p>Projecting out to 2050, these two types of benefit alone are expected to outweigh the costs of increased R&amp;D by 16 to 1 (Hoddinott et al., 2012). By comparison, the benefit-cost ratios estimated within the same project for salt iodization (a form of micronutrient supplement) range between 15 to 1 and 520 to 1, with the latest estimates finding a benefit-cost ratio of 81 to 1 (Hoddinott et al., 2012), and most of the estimates reported to the Copenhagen Consensus panel for the benefit-cost ratio of conditional cash transfers for education fall between 10 to 1 and 2 to 1 (Orazem, 2012). Using a very crude method, we can also convert the benefit-cost ratios into approximate QALY terms. Using a QALY value of three times annual income and taking the income of the beneficiaries to be $4.50 a day (around average income per capita in Sub-Saharan Africa), agricultural R&amp;D is estimated to generate a benefit equivalent to one QALY for every $304.</p><p>Other types of benefit were not tabulated in the Copenhagen Consensus study, but should also be high. Strains that are resistant to drought, for instance, could greatly reduce year-to-year variation in crop yields. More resilient seeds could mitigate the negative effects of climate change on agriculture. Lower food prices may lead to better child nutrition, with life-long improved health and productivity. Finally, higher yields may decrease the potential for conflict due to the pressure on limited land, food and water resources resulting from climate change and population growth. Each of these benefits alone may justify the costs of research and development but, with our limited knowledge, they are not easily quantified.</p><p>The high benefit-cost ratio found by the Copenhagen Consensus team is broadly consistent with other literature. Meta-analysis of 292 academic studies on this topic has found that the median rate of return of agricultural R&amp;D is around 44% (Alston et al., 2000). A rate of return, in this sense, indicates the discount rate at which the costs of an investment are equal to the benefits \u2013 rather like the interest rate on a bank account. More recent studies, focusing on research in Sub-Saharan Africa, have found aggregate returns of 55% (Alene, 2008).</p><p>Unfortunately, the rate of return on investment is not directly comparable to a benefit-cost ratio; the methodology applied often deviates from the welfare based approach applied by the Copenhagen Consensus team and the two numbers cannot be accurately converted into similar terms. Nonetheless, a crude conversion method can be applied to reach a ballpark estimate of the benefit-cost ratio implied by these studies. Assuming a marginal increase in spending on research is borne upfront and that research generates a constant stream of equal benefits each year from then on, the benefit-cost ratio for an investment with a 44% rate of return at a 5% discount rate is 9 to 1.</p><p>There are, however, at least two reasons to treat these high benefit-cost estimates with skepticism.</p><p>First, estimating the effect of research and development is difficult. One problem is attribution. Growth in yields can be observed as can spending on research and development, but it is much more difficult to observe which spending on research led to which increase in yields. If yields grew last year in Ethiopia, was this the result of research that occurred two years ago or ten years ago? Were the improved yields driven by spending on research within Ethiopia, or was it a spillover from research conducted elsewhere in the region or, even, research conducted on another continent? Estimating the effect of R&amp;D spend requires researchers to adopt a specific temporal and spatial model dictating which expenditures can effect which yields in which countries. Teasing out causality can therefore be tricky, and some studies have suggested that inappropriate attribution may have led to systematic bias in the available estimates (e.g. Alston et al., 2009).</p><p>Another problem is cherry picking. Estimates garnered from meta-analysis are likely to be upwardly biased because studies are much more likely to be conducted on R&amp;D programmes that are perceived to be successful. Failed programmes, on the other hand, are likely to be ignored and, as a result, the research may paint an overly optimistic picture of the potential impact of R&amp;D.</p><p>Second, for new technologies to have an impact on the poor, they need to be widely adopted. This step should not be taken for granted. Adoption rates for improved varieties of crops remain low throughout Africa; farmer-saved seeds, which are unlikely to be improved, account for around 80 per cent of planted seeds in Africa compared to a global average of 35 per cent (AGRA, 2013). To some extent, this is because previous research has been poorly targeted at regional needs. The high-yield varieties developed during the Green Revolution require irrigation or very high levels of rainfall. New seed development was focused on wheat and rice, rather than alternative crops such as sorghum, cassava and millet. High yielding varieties required extensive fertilizer use. All of these features rendered them unsuitable for the African context, and explain why it was not easy to replicate the Asian success story elsewhere (Elliot, 2010).</p><p>However, there are more structural features of many developing countries that will limit adoption. Lack of available markets for surplus production can mean that smallholders can see limited benefit from larger harvests, especially when new seeds are costly and require additional labour and expensive fertilizer. Weak property rights undermine incentives to invest, given that farmers may be unable to hold on to their surplus crop or sell it at a fair price. Unavailability of credit means that, even when it makes good economic sense for farmers to invest in improved seeds, they may not be able to raise the initial capital required. The benefit-cost estimates discussed above, based on a synthesis of evidence from a diverse set of contexts, may underestimate the difficulties with adoption in more challenging countries.</p><p>Even in Asia during the Green Revolution, high-yield varieties were adopted first and foremost by large agricultural interests rather than smallholders (Wiggins et al., 2013). If this was the case for newly developed seeds, the impact on the poorest would be more limited than suggested in the Copenhagen Consensus study. They could still benefit from lower food prices and increased employment in the agricultural sector, but in extreme scenarios smallholders may even lose out due to low cost competition from larger farms that adopt new seeds.</p><p>In combination, the difficulties with estimating the effects of R&amp;D and the potential barriers to adoption suggest that the estimated benefit-cost ratios reported earlier are likely to be upwardly biased. The benefit-cost ratios estimated are also lower than those associated with Giving What We Can\u2019s currently recommended charities. For instance, the $304 per QALY estimate based on the Copenhagen Consensus benefit-cost ratio, which appears to be at the higher end of the literature, compares unfavourably to GiveWell\u2019s baseline estimate of $45 to $115 per DALY for insecticide treated bednets (GiveWell, 2013). The benefit-cost ratios also appear to be lower than those associated with micronutrient supplements, as discussed earlier. While there are significant benefits that remain unquantified within agricultural R&amp;D, the same is also true for interventions based on bednet distribution, deworming and micronutrient supplements. As a result, while this area could yield individual high impact opportunities, the literature as it stands does not seem to support the claim that agricultural R&amp;D is likely to be more effective than the best other interventions.\n</p><h2 id=\"References\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Food and Agricultural Organisation,\u2019The State of Food and Agriculture 2013\u2019 (2013)</li>\n\t<li>von Braun, J., Fan, S., Meinzen-Dick, R., Rosegrant, M. and Nin Pratt, A., \u2018What to Expect from Scaling Up CGIAR Investments and \u2018Best Bet\u2019 Programs\u2019 (2008)</li>\n\t<li>Copenhagen Consensus, \u2018Expert Panel Findings\u2019 (2012)</li>\n\t<li>Hoddinott, J., Rosegrant, M. and Torero, M. \u2018Investments to reduce hunger and undernutrition\u2019 (2012)</li>\n\t<li>Orazem, P. \u2018The Case for Improving School Quality and Student Health as a Development Strategy\u2019 (2012)</li>\n\t<li>Alliance for Green Revolution in Africa, \u2018Africa Agriculture Status Report 2013: Focus on Staple Crops\u2019, (2013)</li>\n\t<li>International Food Policy Research Institute, \u20182012 Global Food Policy Report\u2019, (2012)</li>\n\t<li>Elliot, K., \u2018Pulling Agricultural Innovation and the Market Together\u2019, (2010)</li>\n\t<li>Wiggins, S., Farrington, J., Henley, G., Grist, N. and Locke, A. \u2018Agricultural development policy: a contemporary agenda\u2019 (2013)</li>\n\t<li>Givewell, \u2018Mass distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs)\u2019, 2013, <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets\">http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets</a>, retrieved July 10th 2014</li>\n\t<li>The Economist, \u2018A bigger rice bowl\u2019, May 10th 2014</li>\n</ul><p></p></div></div>"},

The first explores the meanings that have been attached to the term \u2018cause\u2019, and suggests my preferred usage. The second makes use of these distinctions to clarify the claims I made in a recent post on the long-term effects of animal welfare improvements.\n</p><h2 id=\"On_the_meaning_of__cause_\">On the meaning of \u2018cause\u2019</h2>\nThere are at least two distinct concepts which could reasonably be labelled a \u2018cause\u2019:\n<ol>\n\t<li>An intervention area, <i>i.e.</i> a cluster of interventions which are related and share some characteristics. It is often the case that improving our understanding of some intervention in this area will improve our understanding of the whole area. We can view different-sized clusters as broader or narrower causes in this sense. GiveWell has <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/30/refining-the-goals-of-givewell-labs/\">promoted this meaning</a>. Examples might include: interventions to improve health in developing countries; interventions giving out leaflets to change behaviour.</li>\n\t<li>A goal, something we might devote resources towards optimising. Some causes in this sense might be useful instrumental sub-goals for other causes. For example, \u201cminimise existential risk\u201d may be a useful instrumental goal for the cause \u201cmake the long-term future flourish\u201d. When 80,000 Hours <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/281-why-pick-a-cause\">discussed reasons to select a cause</a>, they didn\u2019t explicitly use this meaning, but many of their arguments relate to it. A cause of this type may be very close to one of the first type, but defined by its goal rather than its methods: for example, maximising the number of quality-adjusted life-years lived in developing countries. Similarly, one could think of a cause a problem one can work towards solving.</li>\n</ol>\nThese two characteristics often appear together, so we don\u2019t always need to distinguish. But they can come apart: we can have a goal without a good idea of what intervention area will best support that goal. On the other hand, one intervention area could be worthwhile for multiple different goals, and it may not be apparent what goal an intervention is supposed to be targeting. Below I explain how these concepts can diverge substantially.<p></p><p>Which is the better usage? Or should we be using the word for both meanings? (Indeed there may be other possible meanings, such as defining a cause by its beneficiaries, but I think these are the two most natural.) I am not sure about this and would be interested in comments from others towards finding the most natural community norm. Key questions are whether we need to distinguish the concepts, and if we do then which is the more frequently the useful one to think of, and what other names fit them well.</p><p>My personal inclination is that when the meanings coincide of course we can use the one word, and that when they come apart it is better to use the second. This is because I think conversations about choosing a cause are generally concerned with the second, and because I think that \u201cintervention area\u201d is a good alternate term for the first meaning, while we lack such good alternatives for the second.\n</p><h2 id=\"Conclusions_about_animals\">Conclusions about animals</h2>\nIn <a href=\"/ea/6c/human_and_animal_interventions_the_longterm_view/\">a recent post</a> I discussed why the long-term effects of animal welfare improvements in themselves are probably small. A question we danced around in the comments is whether this meant that animal welfare was not the best cause. Some felt it did not, because of various plausible routes to impact from animal welfare interventions. I was unsure because the argument did appear to show this, but the rebuttals were also compelling.<p></p><p>My confusion at least was stemming, at least in part, from the term \u2018cause\u2019 being overloaded.</p><p>Now that I see that more clearly I can explain exactly what I am and am not claiming.</p><p>In that post, I contrasted human welfare improvements, which have many significant indirect and long-run effects, with animal welfare improvements, which appear not to. That is not to say that interventions which improve animal welfare do not have these large long-run effects, but that the long-run effects of such interventions are enacted via shifts in the views of humans rather than directly via the welfare improvement.</p><p>I believe that the appropriate conclusion is that \u201cimprove animal welfare\u201d is extremely unlikely to be the best simple proxy for the goal \u201cmake the long-term future flourish\u201d. In particular, it is likely dominated by the proxy \u201cincrease empathy\u201d. So we can say with confidence that improving animal welfare is not the best cause in the second sense (whereas it may still be a good intervention area). In contrast, we do not have similarly strong reasons to think \u201cimprove human welfare\u201d is definitely not the best approach.</p><p>Two things I am not claiming:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>That improving human welfare is a better instrumental sub-goal for improving the long-term future than improving animal welfare.</li>\n\t<li>That interventions which improve animal welfare are not among the best available, if they also have other effects.</li>\n</ul>\nIf you are not persuaded that it\u2019s worth optimising for the long-term rather than the short-term, the argument won\u2019t be convincing. If you are, though, I think you should not adopt animal welfare as a cause in the second sense. I am not arguing against \u2018increasing empathy\u2019 as possibly the top goal we can target (although I plan to look more deeply into making comparisons between this and other goals), and it may be that \u2018increase vegetarianism\u2019 is a useful way to increase empathy. But we should keep an open mind, and if we adopt \u2018increasing empathy\u2019 as a goal we should look for the best ways to do this, whether or not they relate to animal welfare.<p></p></div></div>"},

I joined <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> previously and was already giving 10% from my part-time self-employed tutoring income. And by January 2012 I started my full-time job as a high-school math teacher and my income more-than-doubled.</p><p>Before taxes I started earning close-to $50,000 and my expenses were less than $20,000. I figured I didn\u2019t need a more-lavish lifestyle and I thought I would be able to sustain giving 50% to cost-effective charities.</p><p>Unfortunately in 2013 I was not working full time and wanted to quickly pay down the college debt of my fianc\u00e9e, so I temporarily decreased my giving to 10%.</p><p>I\u2019m at the moment trying out a work-from-home business in which my parents have been successful; it has the potential for a significantly higher income than a teacher.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Why did you pick Against Malaria Foundation as a place to give? Why not give somewhere else, or to a bunch of different charities?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> At the time that I started giving, AMF was <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>\u2019s top-rated charity. I feel that is the best reason.</p><p>Also, I had several \u201cBirthday for Charity\u201d events and was able to <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com/Fundraiser.aspx?FundraiserID=6941\">raise money for AMF directly through their website</a>. There is certainly a psychological tie to giving to AMF because I\u2019ve publicly endorsed AMF for several years now.</p><p>I\u2019m open to giving to other charities, and through the years have done that. Specifically I gave to <a href=\"http://veganoutreach.org/\">Vegan Outreach</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thehumaneleague.com/\">the Humane League</a> based on the evaluations from <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>.</p><p>There are some strong arguments that conclude that once you find the best charity, you ought to give there. I give the bulk of my money to whichever charity I think does the most towards eliminating extreme poverty, but will continue to give nontrivial amounts to organizations that effectively decrease animal suffering.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>You say your expenses are less than $20K. That\u2019s quite frugal! How do you make that work?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> I don\u2019t want lavish things, my car is for purposes of getting from point A to point B. I try to minimize large expenses (like apartment rent). I rarely eat out (my fiancee cooks amazing food). Most of the entertainment is virtually free: spending time with friends, reading book and internet, watching films at home.</p><p>I wrote up some of the best advice about frugal liging that I\u2019ve come across on my website: <a href=\"http://www.yboris.com/frugal.php\">http://www.yboris.com/frugal.php</a></p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Let\u2019s change topics a little bit. Another thing I\u2019ve seen you talk a lot about is the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GivingWhatWeCanRutgers\">Giving What We Can chapter at Rutgers</a>. What does it do? And how did you get involved with it?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> I was lucky to watch the Rutgers chapter get started (primarily by Nick Beckstead, Mark Lee, and Tim Campbell) and attend the meetings from day one. At our second meeting I gave a short talk about positive psychology and how giving affects happiness (primarily relying on Andreas Mogensen\u2019s wonderful <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/giving-without-sacrifice.pdf\">\u201cGiving Without Sacrifice\u201d</a>).</p><p>By the second academic year I volunteered (and was elected) as the president. The main task has been to organize events, and get others involved. The primary function of the chapter is to draw an audience of undergraduate and graduate students, educate them about the problems of extreme world poverty, and demonstrate to them that they can individually make a big positive difference in the world.</p><p>We\u2019ve done that through a variety of events like lectures (e.g. Poverty: Lessons Learned from Photography), workshops (e.g. THINK\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/modules/charity-assessment\">Evaluating Social Interventions</a>), and fundraising (Booksale for Charity).</p><p>Last academic year we had another President running Giving What We Can: Rutgers, Micha\u00e9l MF.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Wow. I always forget that there are a lot of cool people involved in the Rutgers chapter! Have your events been able to engage people well? What lessons have you learned from running them?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> I wish I tracked our success more quantitatively, but I\u2019m confident that over the years we\u2019ve been able to encourage many to start giving more effectively. At the very least, several of my friends have joined Giving What We Can (started giving at least 10%).</p><p>Some of the events we had, for example <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsl9cyaIn-g\">Thomas Pogge came to give a talk</a>, drew an audience of students who have never heard of Giving What We Can, several stayed around after the talk to learn more. Some events were attended poorly, in part because of poor advertizing on my part, but we have video recordings for others to see, for example <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvUcbcUMtXw\">Zell Kravinsky talked about how he gave away over $40 million</a>.</p><p>While it\u2019s certainly important to have an interesting and educational event, it\u2019s very important to advertise widely. Doing things by yourself isn\u2019t the best strategy, I really recommend giving specific tasks to those who are interested in helping (e.g. contact the student paper to send a correspondent, or print 3 flyers and post them in these buildings).</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Do you have any tips on how to advertise an event so that people get interested and come?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> I\u2019m not sure how important it is to have a well-designed flyers, but posting flyers has been successful for us. There have been times when we post flyers on the day of the event with \u201cTODAY\u201d written on it. I think that can encourage more people to look at the flyer, thus increasing the chances of more people attending.</p><p>Personal invitations have worked well, one acquaintance I had I urged to come to our meeting, she came just because of the request and was interested enough to come to many events for several semesters.</p><p>I had better success getting people to come when I was a student at Rutgers. I don\u2019t know, but it seemed that when we had weekly meetings (same day, same time, same location), we had better attendance than when we had them bi-weekly. Perhaps building a habit is good.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>I saw that as a part of GWWC: Rutgers you even were able to give a TEDx talk on cost-effectiveness in philanthropy. That\u2019s so cool! How did you arrange for that to happen? What came out of it?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> TEDxRutgers happened for several years at Rutgers and in early 2013, Micha\u00e9l MF told me that he knew some of the people organizing the event. Because I\u2019ve given talks related to Effective Altruism (some modeled on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcZkXq2C40I\">Toby Ord\u2019s presentation</a>), Micha\u00e9l put me in touch with the organizers. I was lucky that they still had some space in their line-up and I was accepted with a 12-minute limit.</p><p>I had significant help from friends and the EA community while drafting and revising my talk (at the very least I\u2019d like to thank Roxanne Heston). I wish I had an extra day to practice, because during the final talk I stumbled several times.</p><p>Unfortunately, it took a long time for the video to be edited. But,finally, a year later, we were able to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPe9-OM7vgU\">post it online on the Giving What We Can YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>In addition to raising awareness via Giving What We Can: Rutgers, I\u2019ve also seen you raise awareness on different issues via prolific posting on Facebook. And I remember we once talked about how you were handing out leaflets from Vegan Outreach that encourage people to eat less meat. A lot of people, like me, care a lot about these causes, but are too shy to become activists. How did you cross that bridge?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> I was rather shy even in my first year in college, but by third year I became a lot more social (with the help of a friend who kept encouraging me to go to parties with him). I didn\u2019t like the parties, but at some point I somehow knew hundreds of people and felt a lot more confident talking to strangers.</p><p>At some point, I went silly in the head on Facebook and started befriending people who I just met once, or who had some large number of friends in common; so I managed to have a \u2018network\u2019 of about a thousand people.</p><p>At first I was a cheerleader for science, posting news of fantastic discoveries and potential technologies, but with time, especially once I learned of extreme world poverty and moral arguments like Peter Singer\u2019s, I decided to use my platform to share pro-social ideas.</p><p>I think incremental steps can help one become less uneasy about approaching others (when handing out VO booklets), and it\u2019s easy to talk about what you\u2019re passionate about.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Do you have any recommendations to people that also want to get involved in influencing, whether through Facebook, pamphlets, or official organizations?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> Facebook provides a rather safe environment for starting a conversation. It\u2019s hard to know how much influence posts and discussions can have, but I think over the years, at least a dozen people have messaged me privately saying things akin to \u201cI really appreciate your posts\u201d and even \u201cYou\u2019ve influenced my thinking\u201d.</p><p>I\u2019ve occasionally posted images that were provoking (especially ones urging people to take steps to decrease animal suffering). Sometimes the discussions are hijacked by people that sound like they are from another planet, but at other times it feels productive.</p><p>Getting involved with official organizations is great because they legitimize what you are doing. It\u2019s much easier to talk about a topic when others are there for that purpose.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Has anyone reacted negatively or hostile to your activism? If so, how do you deal with that?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> I\u2019ve had in the past some discussions with friends (in person) where the topic of morality came up and I argued too forcefully. I think one needs to be very careful when discussing issues like that because even well-worded comments can be misunderstood, and even the purpose of the discussion could be misinterpreted. With practice you can get better at these conversations. I absolutely love Giving What We Can\u2019s approach: you just share your excitement about how awesome it is that you can, thanks to research and awesome organizations, help people significantly with little cost to you!</p><p>It\u2019s possible that some people won\u2019t be moved by arguments or other appeals. Something that\u2019s helpful is to keep in mind that people come from different backgrounds with different assumptions. Motivating a change that is too drastic can backfire. Reading books written by psychologist can help (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials/dp/006124189X\">Influence</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Charisma-Myth-Personal-Magnetism/dp/1591845947\">The Charisma Myth</a>, etc)</p><p>One of the most helpful books I\u2019ve read was <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Animal-Activists-Handbook-Maximizing/dp/1590561201\">\u201cThe Animal Activist\u2019s Handbook\u201d</a> which shares excellent (psychology-informed) advice about working towards change.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Speaking of vegan activism, I\u2019ve heard you describe yourself personally as \u201cnear vegan\u201d. What do you mean by that? And how did you make that lifestyle change?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> The first time I heard of vegetarianism was with a PETA leaflet that compared factory farms with concentration camps. This was too-drastic for me to accept at the time and I promptly threw it away with a laugh and a thought \u201ccrazy people\u201d.</p><p>I was lucky that I met many vegetarians through my college careers, many were happy to say why they chose it for themselves, many were not pushy. I think because I liked the people, I was eager to learn more.</p><p>Through extended conversations, and especially because I made a close friend (Graduate Philosophy student) who was vegetarian, I warmed up to the arguments. I was lucky that my diet was primarily vegetables based (mom cooked soups, fried potatoes, etc) so it wasn\u2019t hard to decrease my meat consumption.</p><p>For the longest time, and still, I think of vegetarianism as a continuum. This type of thinking makes it psychologically easier for people to eat less meat: they can feel like they are already doing something by eating less.</p><p>I know it\u2019s possible to be entirely vegan; one year that I was living alone I just refrained from buying animal products. But I think it\u2019s better to be flexible (and not freak out over some butter in your restaurant dish) - this creates a more inviting picture for others to join.</p><p>It\u2019s important not to forget about the social component: you are able to do more by encouraging and inspiring others to change too.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>When not trying to save the world, what do you do in your free time?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> I really enjoy reading and have read some amazing books in the past (I recommend some here: <a href=\"http://www.yboris.com/reading.php\">http://www.yboris.com/reading.php</a>). I like electronic music and listen often through the day (have been listening to trance/progressive house on <a href=\"http://www.di.fm/\">di.fm</a> for over a decade). I enjoy spending time with friends, learning about and joking about trivial things. During the summer, hiking is one of my favorite activities.</p><p>Now I\u2019m lucky to have met a partner for life, Yetzenia, now my fiancee. We live together and thus spend most of the time in each other\u2019s company. I recently bought a used projector and with the help of a large white wall Yetzenia and I watch movies.</p><p>I look forward to the release-version of Oculus Rift.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Last time we talked, you were involved in a massive cross-continental US road trip with your fiancee. What\u2019s that like? What\u2019s your favorite moment?</em></p><p><strong>B:</strong> It\u2019s hard to pick one. The 10,000-mile trip was wonderful and we both learned a lot about what we like and what we don\u2019t. There were numerous beautiful moments, I\u2019ll share one.</p><p>One of the most exhilarating moments for me was when I found a probably-five-story-high mountain of sand along the East Coast Highway in California (some miles north of LA); I walked up it for a long time, and then ran down. Yetzenia described that I looked like a gazelle. By the time I reached the bottom I was breathless, laughing, with tears running down my eyes from the wind.</p><p>-</p><p><strong>P:</strong> <em>Wow, that sounds really fun! Well, thanks for taking the time to let me get to know you! This was awesome!</em></p><p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/interview-with-boris-yakubchik/\">Everyday Utilitarian</a></em></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "28th May 2014", "title": "How much do Y Combinator founders earn?", "author": "RyanCarey", "num_comments": "1 comment", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p></p><h2 id=\"Introduction_and_summary\">Introduction and summary</h2>\nWe\u2019re interested in estimating how much tech entrepreneurs earn, since it\u2019s one of our top recommended <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/314-in-which-career-can-you-make-the-most-difference\">careers</a>, partly because of its earnings. Big earners can create a lot of economic value and can sometimes become <a href=\"/earning-to-give\">big donors</a>. We wanted to find out: <em>if you get into Y Combinator, how much will you earn?</em> We\u2019re interested in Y Combinator because it\u2019s the best known seed accelerator, and the data is available. Here\u2019s what we found:\n<ul>\n\t<li>The total value of Y Combinator companies is $26 billion, of which the founders own $8 billion.</li>\n\t<li>Most of the returns have gone to a tiny minority of super-successes. The founders of AirBnB, Dropbox and Stripe are worth about US$7 billion, about 78% of all founders\u2019 equity, although they account for 0.5% of the companies.</li>\n\t<li>Outside of the most successful companies, it was still possible to earn significant returns. 12% of companies from the first five years of Y Combinator are now worth US$40 million or more, and a further 10% have sold for US$5-40 million. The remainder probably earned little more than their (low) salaries.</li>\n\t<li><strong>On average, founders from the first five years of Y Combinator are now worth US$18 million after 5-9 years, meaning that their average net worth has increased by US$2.5 million per year</strong></li>\n\t<li>When it invests in its companies, Y Combinator values them at US$1.7 million, of which each founding team owns $1.6 million. This means that for average team sizes, each founder owns $700,000 of equity. So founders must earn (in cash or equity) substantially more than $100,000 per year, on average.</li>\n\t<li>We expect the average earnings (in cash or equity) going forward to be less than $2.5 million per founder per year because of competitors to Y Combinator and regression to the mean.</li>\n\t<li>Y Combinator accept 2.5% of applications.</li>\n\t<li>Your personal expected earnings from applying to Y Combinator depend on your chance of being accepted and your chance of creating the next AirBnB or Dropbox.</li>\n</ul>\nThe rest of this post will:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Estimate the value of Y Combinator startups so far</li>\n\t<li>Study the historical earnings of Y Combinator startups including i) average earnings, ii) mid-range outcomes and iii) failures</li>\n\t<li>Discuss the likely earnings of future Y Combinator founders</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"What_are_Y_Combinator_startups_worth_so_far_\">What are Y Combinator startups worth so far?</h2>\nAs at April 2014, the total value of the roughly 634 startups that have passed through Y Combinator is over US$26 billion. Two years ago, Forbes estimated the total value of Y Combinator companies at <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2012/04/30/top-tech-incubators-as-ranked-by-forbes-y-combinator-tops-with-7-billion-in-value/\">US$7.8 billion</a><sup><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>, but this year, their value has skyrocketed due to its largest companies receiving big valuations in their latest funding rounds:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Dropbox was valued <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303465004579327001976757542\">US$10 billion</a>.</li>\n\t<li>Stripe was valued at <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304632204579337043662898228\">US$1.75 billion</a>.</li>\n\t<li>AirBnB was valued at <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304626304579509800267341652\">US$10 billion</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.seed-db.com/accelerators/view?acceleratorid=1011\">Seed-DB</a> estimate that the total of all companies that have exited is US$1.3 billion<sup><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup>. The rest of operating companies are probably worth another few billion<sup><a href=\"#fn:3\">3</a></sup>. So of the total of US$26 billion, the overwhelming majority comes from the three top companies.<p></p><p>Paul Graham has previously <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/swan.html\">noted</a> how unintuitively fat-tailed startup investing can be:\n</p><blockquote>\u201cEffectively all the returns are concentrated in a few big winners. The total value of the companies we\u2019ve funded is around US$10 billion, give or take a few. But just two companies, Dropbox and Airbnb, account for about three quarters of it.\u201d</blockquote>\nInvesting in startups is risky. However, founding them is even riskier, because founders can\u2019t diversify their equity across multiple firms. Of founders backed by venture capital, the top <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w13056\">2%</a> get half of the equity. Of Y Combinator founders, the top 0.5% have 78% of the total equity<sup><a href=\"#fn:4\">4</a></sup>. Essentially, Drew Houston from Dropbox has put all his eggs in one basket and it has paid off.<p></p><p>Whether this bet will appeal to you depends on what you plan to do with the money. As Bill Gates points out, if you spend millions of dollars on yourself, they soon reach diminishing returns:\n</p><blockquote>\u201cI can understand wanting to have millions of dollars, there\u2019s a certain freedom, meaningful freedom, that comes with that. But once you get much beyond that, I have to tell you, <em>it\u2019s the same hamburger</em>. Dick\u2019s [the Seattle fast food chain] has not raised their prices enough.\u201d</blockquote>\nIn contrast, giving can scale. As our researcher Carl Shulman <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers\">put it</a>: <em>What would I do with a tenth Ferrari? Not much. But with my tenth vaccine\u2026 I can vaccinate another kid.</em> So if you can think of good things to do with a billion dollars, or if earning that billion dollars indicates you created a lot of economic value, entering Y Combinator becomes more desirable.\n<h2 id=\"How_much_do_Y_Combinator_founders_earn_\">How much do Y Combinator founders earn?</h2>\nThe total earnings of all Y Combinator founders is around US$9 billion and so the average founding team is worth US$14 million. Together, the founding teams of AirBnB and Dropbox are worth about US$6 billion. Stripe\u2019s founding team are probably worth about another billion dollars<sup><a href=\"#fn:5\">5</a></sup>. On my previous estimate, the remainder of Y Combinator companies are worth US$4.25 billion. Of this, the founders probably only own $2 billion.<sup><a href=\"#fn:6\">6</a></sup> This gives a grand total of $9 billion of founder-equity, representing 35% of the total value of Y Combinator companies.<p></p><p>The problem with averaging across all Y Combinator companies is that some of them are too young to have achieved much growth.</p><p>To get a less conservative estimate, we can focus on the older companies. The total net worth of founders from the first 5 years of Y Combinator\u2019s operations (2005-09) is about $7 billion<sup><a href=\"#fn:7\">7</a></sup> or $48 million per founding team<sup><a href=\"#fn:8\">8</a></sup>. This estimate depends a little on which exact year you cut it off. From 05-08, the total net worth is US$3 billion, or US$30 million per founding team. Let\u2019s split the difference and say that the average founding team from Y Combinator\u2019s heyday has earned US$39 million. Assuming typically-sized teams, this is $18 million per founder. As 5-9 years have passed since the graduation of these companies, they have earned about US$2.5 million per founder per year over this time<sup><a href=\"#fn:9\">9</a></sup></p><p>To get a more conservative estimate, we can see what Y Combinator pays to invest in companies. Y Combinator recently increased their standard investment to US$120,000, valuing each company at US$1.7 million, of which each founding team owns $1.6 million<sup><a href=\"#fn:10\">10</a></sup>. At this valuation, each founder stands to earn US$100,000 per year (in cash or equity).<sup><a href=\"#fn:11\">11</a></sup> However, this estimate will be low because Y Combinator\u2019s business model depends on investing at a discount rate in exchange for training and access to further investment.\n</p><h3 id=\"What_about_founders_that_didn_t_win_big_\">What about founders that didn\u2019t win big?</h3>\nFor the overwhelming majority of founders, their basket of eggs does not turn to gold. This leaves a range of possibilities. Looking again at graduates from the first five years of Y Combinator, 55 (38%) of these companies are now dead, 38 (26%) have been sold and 52 (36%) continue to operate. <a href=\"http://mattermark.com/number-of-y-combinator-companies-sold-for-over-40m-by-year-funded/\">Paul Graham</a> recently said that 18 (12%) of the startups from this period have been sold or valued at US$40 million<sup><a href=\"#fn:12\">12</a></sup>. I count 6 companies that have sold for that much,<sup><a href=\"#fn:13\">13</a></sup> leaving 12 in operation. I count a further 15 companies that have sold for between US$5 and $40 million<sup><a href=\"#fn:14\">14</a></sup>. So here is how it all breaks down:<p></p><p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0eGj9qB.png\" alt=\"Y Combinator results from 05-09\"></p><p>So most of these companies have died or are struggling on with low valuations. A few still stand a chance at making it big, and a substantial minority have made small exits. These small (US$0-40m) exits are smaller than they may seem because a) the founding team only owns a portion of the equity, b) this must be divided between the founders, c) it will be taxed and d) it is achieved by years of hard work with minimal salary.\n</p><h3 id=\"What_about_the_companies_that_died_\">What about the companies that died?</h3>\nThe founders whose companies die usually only earn small salaries. Before being admitted to Y Combinator, founders usually live off savings or taking <a href=\"http://www.kauffman.org/~/media/kauffman_org/research%20reports%20and%20covers/2008/11/capital_structure_decisions_new_firms.pdf\">loans</a>. During the Y Combinator program, they use only a one-off seed investment from Y Combinator of <a href=\"http://blog.ycombinator.com/the-new-deal\">US$120,000</a> to pay living and business expenses<sup><a href=\"#fn:15\">15</a></sup>. If they go on to receive angel investment can pay themselves about <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/How-much-money-should-company-founders-get-as-salary\">$50,000</a> per year. With venture capital funding, this tends to increase to about <a href=\"http://www.sethlevine.com/wp/2012/08/how-much-should-a-start-up-ceo-make\">US$100,000</a> per year<sup><a href=\"#fn:16\">16</a></sup>.\n<h2 id=\"How_much_could_you_expect_to_earn_going_forward_\">How much could you expect to earn going forward?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Will_Y_Combinator_s_results_project_into_the_future_\">Will Y Combinator\u2019s results project into the future?</h3>\nSo should we expect founders earnings to continue at their historical average? There are some reasons to suspect that they will not. First, the valuation environment for technology companies <a href=\"http://avc.com/2014/03/the-bubble-question/\">may</a> worsen. Second, competing seed accelerators have arisen and so some of Y Combinator\u2019s founders and venture capitalists may leave. Third, there is a selection effect at play. There is a lot of unpredictable variation in the performance of incubators. We have studied Y Combinator because of its fame and success, but some of the early teams may have been lucky, upwardly distorting our estimates<sup><a href=\"#fn:17\">17</a></sup>. Over time, we should expect performance to regress to the mean. All things considered, these factors make US$2.5 million per founder per year an optimistic forward estimate.\n<h3 id=\"What_are_my_chances_of_being_accepted_by_Y_Combinator_\">What are my chances of being accepted by Y Combinator?</h3>\nThe next part of the equation is your chance of being accepted. Y Combinator inform me that they have accepted 2.5% of their latest batch of applicants, with a few late applications still pending<sup><a href=\"#fn:18\">18</a></sup>.<p></p><p>It is hard to estimate the chance of being accepted to Y Combinator for a particular individual. The competition is exceptionally technically able, intelligent and determined. Your chance of getting accepted will depend on <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/founders.html\">personality traits</a>, the <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/start.html\">strength of your</a> cofounders, and the <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/howtoapply.html\">quality of your product</a>. Mostly, Y Combinator invest in internet technology startups but they are also starting to fund <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=27&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CLICEKkCMBo&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnews%2Fstart-up-investor-bets-on-biotech-1.15096&amp;ei=y11YU4eEBq2w7AadpYHYBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSS4DATf75GRP48VvPjRFVJyIXLw&amp;sig2=6aJRje4MfWEVYH69cdPV0w\">biotechnology</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=25&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CJ8CEBYwGA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techmeme.com%2F130906%2Fp20&amp;ei=y11YU4eEBq2w7AadpYHYBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFUOt4b7Fa0uaxe7wr9JLQ5Qeu7XQ&amp;sig2=up4dEFfLxtSJoUHzs7T-gQ\">nonprofits</a>.\n</p><h3 id=\"What_are_my_expected_earnings_once_I_get_into_Y_Combinator_\">What are my expected earnings once I get into Y Combinator?</h3>\nAlmost all of the expected earnings of Y Combinator founders are concentrated in the tail - in the AirBnBs and Dropboxes. So your expected earnings in Y Combinator depend on the extent to which your company resembles these big successes. For a lot of people, whether to enter Y Combinator, and entrepreneurship in general, hinges on the answer to this hard question.<p></p><p>So what predicts big success? Well, venture capitalists think they know something about this - some companies find it relatively easy to get their funding and others struggle. We\u2019ve only reviewed a little of the relevant literature, but it appears that <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/23-entrepreneurship-a-game-of-poker-not-roulette%20\">intelligence</a> is at least somewhat predictive of success. Typically, the most successful founders are more ambitious than average, have technical expertise, have a strong team, and have entered a top university (though have not necessarily finished). For marginal founders who would not find it easy to get funding and do not resemble the super-successes, it may not be good to enter Y Combinator. On the other hand, individuals who possess more of the traits of successful entrepreneurs can plausibly claim that if they pass the application, they will earn - on expectations - millions of dollars per year. There is plenty of opportunity for more research here.</p><p>The bottom line is that we expect future Y Combinator founders to make an average of US$700,000-18 million, or US$100,000-2.5 million per year, and the chance of being accepted is 2.5%. What you personally can expect to earn by applying to Y Combinator depends on:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>How likely you are to get accepted into Y Combinator, and</li>\n\t<li>How likely you are to go on to create the next AirBnB or Dropbox (2 companies among hundreds).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Footnotes\">Footnotes</h2>\n<div>\n<ol>\n\t<li>In June 2011, Paul Graham said the top 21 companies were worth <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/nums.html\">US$4.7 billion</a>. <a href=\"#fnref:1\">\u21a9</a></li>\n\t<li>Seed DB has estimates for &gt;80% of exited companies.

YC own another few percent. <a href=\"#fnref:6\">\u21a9</a></li>\n\t<li>This is from AirBnB, Dropbox and a handful of others. <a href=\"#fnref:7\">\u21a9</a></li>\n\t<li>We can estimate the total market capitalisation of the companies too. The companies from the first 5 years (2005-09) of Y Combinator are worth US$24 billion, or US$170 million each, on average. If you move the cut-off forward by a year (05-10), the average market capitalisation is US$120m. If you push it back by a year, the average is US$130m.

{"date": "2nd May 2014", "title": "Effective altruism outreach plans", "author": "Niel_Bowerman2", "num_comments": "16 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p></p><h2 id=\"Overview\">Overview</h2>\nOver the coming couple of years, the primary project that <a href=\"http://www.williammacaskill.com/\">William MacAskill</a> and I, <a href=\"http://www.nielbowerman.com/\">Niel Bowerman</a>, will be working is effective altruism outreach. We\u2019re now referring to this as a distinct project within the Centre for Effective Altruism, called, fittingly, \u201cEA Outreach\u201d. Our aim is to grow and strengthen the effective altruism (EA) movement. \u00a0In this post I lay out some of my current thoughts on what this might involve. \u00a0This is only my current best guess, and is likely to change as the project evolves.\n<h2 id=\"Movement_building_strategy\">Movement-building strategy</h2>\nMuch of the work we will be doing can be conceptualised in a four-stage movement-building strategy. \u00a0This framework builds on the model we used while I was volunteering for President Obama on his Energy and Environment Policy Team during his first presidential campaign. \u00a0It has also developed out of thinking I did with people like <a href=\"http://www.caspertk.co.uk/\">Casper Ter Kuile</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielvockins\">Dan Vockins</a> and <a href=\"http://party.coop/person/ben-west/\">Ben West</a> while building the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Youth_Climate_Coalition\">UK Youth Climate Coalition</a>.<p></p><p>This framework can be thought of as the four stages that we would like people to move through while involved in the EA community. \u00a0Briefly, the four stages are:\n</p><ol>\n\t<li><b>Initial contact</b>, in which people first hear about EA, and are exposed to its ideas enough to want to find out more.</li>\n\t<li><b>Getting involved</b>, where people are actively learning about the principles behind EA, getting involved in the community, and taking actions to increase their social impact.</li>\n\t<li><b>Training up</b>,<b> </b>which is about giving people the access to information, mentoring, networks and resources that they need to scale up their impact.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sustainability</strong>, which is about making the movement sustainable by preventing burning-out and ensuring the long-term survival of the movement.</li>\n</ol>\nI will now discuss our activities in each stage in more detail. \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/four-box-design-v2.1-cropped.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/four-box-design-v2.1-cropped.jpg\" alt=\"four-box design v2.1 cropped\"></a>\n<h2 id=\"Initial_contact\">Initial contact</h2>\nThe first stage in a person\u2019s involvement in a movement is finding out about it. \u00a0We have a unique and unusually good opportunity in William MacAskill\u2019s upcoming book titled \u201cEffective Altruism\u201d, which we hope to use to introduce more people to the movement.\n<h3 id=\"William_MacAskill_s_book\">William MacAskill\u2019s book</h3>\n<a title=\"Announcing a forthcoming book on effective altruism\" href=\"/ea/60/announcing_a_forthcoming_book_on_effective/\">William MacAskill\u2019s book</a> will be released in the summer of 2015, and we hope to use the time between now and then in order to build a media and marketing campaign around it, and in particular around EA.<p></p><p>In the US, the book will be published by <a href=\"http://www.penguin.com/meet/publishers/gotham/\">Gotham</a>, an imprint of Penguin Books USA. \u00a0In the UK we have a deal with <a href=\"http://www.faber.co.uk/about/press/guardian-faber/\">Guardian Faber</a>, a collaboration between publisher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faber_and_Faber\">Faber and Faber</a> and national newspaper <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\">The Guardian</a>. \u00a0We will be collaborating closely with The Guardian for our UK marketing and media campaign.</p><p>Our marketing campaign around the book has three main components: maximising sales in the first week, maximising sales after the opening week, and maximising the flow-through benefits for the EA movement. \u00a0I won\u2019t go into the strategy on each of these components here to prevent this post from getting too long.</p><p>Will has pledged his profits from book sales will either be reinvested in marketing or be donated to effective charities. \u00a0Peter Singer is also currently working on a more academic book about EA, and he and William are coordinating campaigns so as to increase the impact of these publications.\n</p><h3 id=\"Media_campaign\">Media campaign</h3>\nWe will begin the media run-up to the book launch by introducing the ideas behind EA to the media in the latter half of 2014. \u00a0The current strategy is to create a debate around the principles behind EA as applied to contemporary news topics.<p></p><p>We are contractually obliged to undertake a \u2018media silence\u2019 in the US in first half of 2015. \u00a0This is so that we can increase our chances of appearing in the major US media outlets in launch week in summer 2015 as we would not have been in them for the past six months.</p><p>In the UK, because of our partnership with the Guardian, we will probably do some media outreach in the first half of 2015, however this is still under negotiation.\n</p><h3 id=\"Speaking_tour\">Speaking tour</h3>\nAccording to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Author-Bestselling-Book-Publicity-Book/dp/1593375247\">Robyn Spizman and Rick Frishman</a>, on average one in four audience members buy a copy of the book on speaking tours. \u00a0In the summer and autumn/fall of 2015 William MacAskill will be going on a speaking tour of EA chapters. \u00a0We hope that William\u2019s book will offer audience members a direct next step to take after the talk in order to learn more about EA.\n<h2 id=\"Getting_involved\">Getting involved</h2>\nWilliam MacAskill\u2019s book, as well as much of the media interest, will direct people online to learn more about EA, and to get involved. \u00a0Over the coming year, we are hoping to build an easy-to-use entry point that people can come to in order to learn more about EA and to get involved.\n<h3 id=\"EffectiveAltruism_org\">EffectiveAltruism.org</h3>\nWe have purchased EffectiveAltruism.com and EffectiveAltruism.org. The current Effective-Altruism.com site will probably move to EffectiveAltruism.org/blog. We will develop this site considerably from where it is now. We hope that EffectiveAltruism.org will become the landing page for people interested in learning more about EA for the first time. \u00a0We will have content there to help people learn about the core concepts behind EA, as well as lots of links to other organisations and other EA projects that people can get involved in. We aim for it to be a hub or entry point for anyone who hears about effective altruism (such as through the book or publicity) to find out about the many EA organisations.<p></p><p>EffectiveAltruism.org will not itself be providing large numbers of volunteering opportunities for people to get involved in, nor will it be coordinating chapters or meet ups. \u00a0It will simply be publicising these opportunities. \u00a0We hope that groups such as <a href=\"http://dotimpact.im/\">.impact</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GiveWell\">growing</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">number</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.greatestgoodfoundation.com/\">of</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups\">different</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">effective</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">altruist</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://rationality.org/\">organisations</a> will help provide these volunteering and meet-up opportunities.\n</p><h3 id=\"EffectiveAltruism_com\">EffectiveAltruism.com</h3>\nEffectiveAltruism.com will be a landing page for the Effective Altruism book, and an alternative route into the content on EffectiveAltruism.org. \u00a0We hope that these sites will be able to use a unified back-end.\n<h2 id=\"Training_up\">Training up</h2>\nOnce people are involved in the EA movement, we want to be able to give them opportunities to train up by gaining skills, growing their networks, increasing access to resources and providing mentoring and guidance. \u00a0Groups like <a href=\"http://rationality.org/\">CFAR</a> and <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a> are already doing great work in this area, and so we will spend relatively less time in this area compared to the activities outlined above.<p></p><p>There are a few initiatives that we would like to take on if others in the EA community do not take them on first. \u00a0These include setting up a mentoring scheme within the community, and undertaking an initiative to make it easier for EA donors to fund new EA projects.\n</p><h3 id=\"Effective_Altruism_Research\">Effective Altruism Research</h3>\nIn order to allow people to learn about the more in-depth side of effective altruism (for example the details of giving now vs later, or the haste consideration) we plan to set up a well-categorised and easily searchable curated collection of posts on more advanced EA topics. \u00a0As the community grows, we think it will be useful to centralise and categorise this work so that people can learn about advanced EA topics more easily. \u00a0We are currently looking for a volunteer curator for this project, so if you are interested please contact me at first.last@centreforeffectivealtruism.org\n<h2 id=\"Movement_sustainability\">Movement sustainability</h2>\nOnce a movement has attracted people, and they have trained up and are having significant social impact, the challenge is to keep people involved in the movement if that is where they can be having the most impact. \u00a0This means preventing burn-out on an individual level, but also ensuring that the movement as a whole does not collapse. \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.leverageresearch.org/\">Leverage Research</a> have been doing some work in this area, but there is much more that can be done, and so this is the final area in which we will focus our efforts.<p></p><p>For example, the specific concept and message of EA is likely to be determined early on. But currently no-one is doing brand management for this. There is a risk that the concept becomes too weird (e.g. sole focus on existential risks from artificial intelligence), too mainstream (giving 1% to Oxfam is \u2018effective altruism\u2019), becomes too dominated by one specific cause-area, or otherwise starts to develop the wrong attributes (too aggressive, not welcoming, not having high enough epistemic standards). \u00a0We will be carefully monitoring each of these risks throughout our media campaign and defending against them.\n</p><h2 id=\"Target_audience\">Target audience</h2>\nWe will be developing our marketing strategy in more detail as the project develops, however at this stage it is clear that we will have at least two distinct target markets. \u00a0The first is people quite similar to those who have already been drawn to effective altruism. \u00a0This is a broad audience and is likely to be further segmented.<p></p><p>The second audience we hope to reach out to is certain types of VIPs. \u00a0We have noticed that our successes to date across most areas, whether in moving money to effective charities, fundraising, raising the profile of effective altruism, or our policy advocacy, have usually been reliant on a surprisingly small number of particularly influential people that we have reached out to. \u00a0We would like to focus more of our efforts on these VIPs in order to increase the overall impact of our work.\n</p><h2 id=\"Going_forward\">Going forward</h2>\nWilliam MacAskill will complete the first draft of the US version of \u201cEffective Altruism\u201d in summer 2014. \u00a0This will then go out to a number of review panels and editors to refine it and polish it further. \u00a0Simultaneously William will be working on the UK version of \u201cEffective Altruism\u201d (he will be using some different examples, different phraseology, probably a slightly different tone, and of course different spelling). \u00a0Once the writing stage is complete we plan to move onto the first stage of the media campaign. \u00a0Alongside this William will be starting as a Junior Research Fellow at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_College,_Cambridge\">Emmanuel College, Cambridge</a> from October 2014.<p></p><p>In my role as Director of Special Projects at the <a href=\"http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">Centre for Effective Altruism</a> I split my time between this project and the <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/research/global-priorities-project/\">Global Priorities Project</a>. \u00a0Part of my time over the coming weeks will be spent coordinating the media launch of the Global Priorities Projects report on Unprecedented Technological Risk with the <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">Future of Humanity Institute</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/\">Oxford Martin School</a>. \u00a0However in the future I aim to spend approximately 80% of my time on the EA Outreach project. \u00a0I am currently developing a more in-depth strategy for the project, which we will then take to The Guardian to get buy-in before moving going ahead with it.</p><p>If funding allows we would like to hire someone with PR and marketing experience to do the day-to-day coordination of the marketing and media campaigns for this project. \u00a0We have identified a couple of candidates for this role in our recent recruitment round. \u00a0We have also identified web developers who have offered to develop the sites discussed above for significantly reduced rates. \u00a0We will start on these projects once the overall strategy is finalised.</p><p>I am always keen to hear people\u2019s feedback and suggestions, so please do comment below if you have thoughts about the strategy outlined above.</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "16th Mar 2014", "title": "Announcing a forthcoming book on effective altruism", "author": "William_MacAskill", "num_comments": "3 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>I'm delighted to officially announce my forthcoming book on effective altruism. The current working titles are <em>Effective Altruism</em> for the US edition, and <em>Doing Good Better</em> for the UK edition. The US edition is being published with the Gotham imprint of Penguin USA, and the UK edition is being published with Guardian Faber (a collaboration between the Guardian newspaper and Faber). The book will be pitched to publishers in other countries after the manuscript has been written.</p><p>The book will be an accessible introduction to the idea of effective altruism, presented for a popular audience. It'll be in two parts. The first part explains the key principles behind effective altruism, illustrating them with reference to a wide variety of issues \u2014 charity and career choice, which are heavily discussed by EAs, but also issues that are often discussed in mainstream media like Fair Trade, socially responsible investing, and sweatshop labour. The second part takes those principles and applies them to the questions of how to spend your money, how to spend your time, what are the most important causes, and what is the highest-value activity to be doing right now.</p><p>I'd really like this to be the go-to resource for people interested in, but still new to, effective altruism. And, as I've been discovering, writing well for a popular audience is extremely difficult \u2014 there are a huge number of decisions that require judgment calls, like how colloquial to be, how philosophical, how academic, how much to include, which topics to include\u2026 So I'm planning to gather as much feedback on drafts of the book as I possibly can. If you're interested in providing feedback, please e-mail me to let me know!</p><p>The timeline for the book is that I hand in the final manuscript on the 1st August; it'll then come out one year later. You can expect to not hear much from me until August, but then to hear a lot from me after then, as I'll be spending some time writing articles and op-eds.</p><p>The motivation for my taking on this project is that I think that growing the EA movement is the among the best things I can be doing with my time: every new involved member of the EA community means another 80,000 hours devoted to doing the most good. And that's a big deal!</p></div></div>"},

I think this could be a good idea, but rather than seeing individual scores, I\u2019d much rather see a collective team score for EA.  We\u2019d compete as a group to beat our past group selves (make March better than February, for example) rather than compete amongst ourselves as individuals.</p>\n<p>There are several problems with the individual competition model, but the biggest problem is the most fundamental \u2014 <b>effective altruism is not</b> (and shouldn\u2019t be) <b>a competition.</b>  Rather, we are a team.  A community.  We all have one common goal.</p>\n<p>I know some effective altruists who see EAs like Holden Karnofsky or what not do incredible things, and feel a little bit of resentment at themselves and others; feeling inadequate that they can\u2019t make such a large difference.  This is an important feeling for generating a desire to improve, and keeping a <a href=\"http://michaelgr.com/2007/04/15/fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset-which-one-are-you/\">growth mindset</a> in the face of this could lead to great things for you.  However, it\u2019s even more important not to let this get you into depression, <b>simply because Holden\u2019s success is also your success.</b></p>\n<p>All effective altruists care about is making sure that the world is a better place.  It doesn\u2019t matter who is doing the better-ing.  If Holden, Bill Gates, and Dustin Moskovitz each have 1 billion EA points and you only have five, you should be celebrating the fact that the EA community is collectively at 3 billion and five EA points and that you\u2019re helping.  You shouldn\u2019t feel bad that you\u2019re not doing as well.</p>\n<p>We all have different skills and abilities.  Growth mindset does say that we each have an ability to be incredibly effective and altruistic, but we still all start with different places.  It\u2019s simply not the case that all of us, right this year, could be making seven figure donations to GiveWell or be putting in 80 hours a week at a top non-profit.  But we all can do our best and try a little harder.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start seeing ourselves more as a community where everyone has something to offer and celebrate our collective success, not despair over who is or is not the most effective.  Effective altruism shouldn\u2019t be a competition (at least, among individuals).</p>\n<em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/effective-altruism-is-not-a-competition/\">Everyday Utilitarian</a></em></div></div>"},

{"date": "19th Jan 2014", "title": "Notes on GiveWell's recommended charities", "author": "David_Barry", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>GiveWell recently announced the latest update of their <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">top charities</a> list. This post is a collection of my notes on the changes, mostly focusing on the cost-effectiveness estimates.A year ago I put a lot of hours into understanding the cost-effectiveness calculations for deworming and cash transfers, the results of which I wrote up in <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/01/23/guest-post-from-david-barry-about-deworming-cost-effectiveness/\">this post</a>. I had planned to make this a fairly short post, merely indicating the important changes from last year, but I ended up going into a bit of detail (it's still a lot shorter than last year's).Before I get into all that, a few preliminaries:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>The <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com/Default.aspx\">Against Malaria Foundation</a> distributes insecticide-treated bednets; the primary benefit is preventing child deaths from malaria. I think of its effectiveness in units of dollars per (statistical) life saved.</li>\n\t<li>The <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto\">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a> (SCI) funds and helps to implement mass deworming programmes. The <a href=\"http://www.dewormtheworld.org/\">Deworm the World Initiative</a> (DtWI) encourages governments to implement mass deworming programmes. The primary benefits from deworming school-aged children are that they grow into healthier, stronger adults, and are more productive in adulthood. (A secondary benefit comes from improving the health of worm-infected children in the short-term.) I think of the benefits in units of \"proportional increase in (discounted) adult consumption relative to income, per donated dollar\".</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a> transfer cash to poor households in Kenya and Uganda. Some of this money is consumed, some is invested; the benefit is in units of \"proportional increase in (discounted) consumption relative to income, per donated dollar\".</li>\n</ul>\nI use the following approximate equivalences (your mileage may vary!):\n<ul>\n\t<li>1 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability-adjusted_life_year\">DALY</a> averted is equivalent to consumption of 3 times annual income;</li>\n\t<li>1 statistical life saved by bednets is equivalent to 34 DALY's averted.</li>\n</ul>\nIt is a little silly to be so precise as to say \"34\" DALY's and in my head I usually round to 30. I only wrote 34 above so that it's consistent with a discount rate of 1.7% \u2013 I use that discount rate because that's roughly around where I feel it should be.\n<h2 id=\"Against_Malaria_Foundation\">Against Malaria Foundation</h2>\nGiveWell (perhaps only temporarily) removed AMF from its recommended charities because they don't think that AMF has room for more funding. I can't comment particularly usefully on this topic; those who want the details can read <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/26/change-in-against-malaria-foundation-recommendation-status-room-for-more-funding-related/\">this post</a> on the GiveWell blog. The important question is whether or not AMF will be able to secure agreements for large net distributions with one or more governments. If they can't, then they won't be able to spend the money directed to them via GiveWell as fast as it comes in. If they can't, it won't be so bad \u2013 the money donated will be spent well, it just won't be spent for a while.<p></p><p>My subjective guess is that the probability of AMF securing an agreement for a large net distribution is high enough to warrant continuing donating to them.</p><p>It is also important note some changes to GiveWell's assessment of bednet distributions. The rather surprising headline figure is a cost per life saved of $3400 (using average costs) or $3200 (using marginal costs). This is up almost $1000 from last year. The changes come from an increase in average net costs ($5.54 to $6.13) and the introduction of a fudge factor to take into account mosquito resistance to the insecticides used to treat the nets. GiveWell subjectively estimate this factor at 80% (so that cost per life saved is multiplied by 1/0.8 = 1.25).</p><p>I don't have much of a feel for what this number should be. On the one hand, the resistance seems to develop over a number of years, it's been sporadically monitored for a while, resistance on <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets/insecticide-resistance-malaria-control\">the map here</a> is defined at at least 20% mosquito survival, and there are plenty of dots on the map which don't show such levels of resistance. On the other hand, I was reading a report a few weeks ago (I forget which one) on this topic and it was dispiriting. On balance, I feel that 80% is being a little too pessimistic for the time being, and I'll round down GiveWell's $3400 figure to $3000, while hoping that a properly effective vaccine will eventually render this problem moot.\n</p><h2 id=\"Deworming\">Deworming</h2>\nThis calculation remains horrendously convoluted.<p></p><p>The same host of subjective adjustment factors are present in this year's calculation \u2013 the results rely on a study that was run in an area with particularly high levels of worm infection, and there's some disagreement in the literature over how effective mass deworming programmes are (as opposed to more targeted deworming treatment). For the most part I am happy with the range of subjective guesses I used last year. An important not-so-subjective change is SCI's cost per treatment, up from $0.51 to somewhere between $0.72 and $1.13. The GiveWell staff use $0.99 as their best guess, but their <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative\">SCI review</a> describes this value as \"conservative\", and I'd be happier with a figure closer to $0.72. I've used $0.80 as my input into the spreadsheet.</p><p>GiveWell have tidied up the calculation in one place \u2013 last year it was assumed (at least implicitly) that all benefits from deworming, both developmental and short-term, came from giving the treatment to children. This year the short-term health benefits to adults are included. This gives a non-trivial boost to the overall cost-effectiveness, almost cancelling out the effect of the increase in estimated cost per treatment.</p><p>GiveWell's spreadsheet has a \"Prevalence/intensity adjustment - SCI\" input, set to 66.67%. This is new; last year I argued that this should be incorporated into the external validity adjustment, so I'm happy to see it there (though I set it to 100% and use the same external validity adjustment as I did last year).</p><p>Putting it all together, my preferred inputs say that a donated dollar to SCI increases discounted consumption for one person by 1.4% of annual income, down from my best guess of 1.7% last year. By the equivalences I listed at the start, that equates to a cost per life-saved-equivalent of $7000.</p><p>DtWI's advocacy efforts are so hard to quantify that I will ignore the cost-effectiveness calculation for it.\n</p><h2 id=\"Cash_transfers\">Cash transfers</h2>\nThe cost-effectiveness of cash transfers depends on the percentage of the transfers that get invested, and the return on those investments. Last year I followed the GiveWell staff and estimated that 75% of GiveDirectly's cash transfers would be invested, and assumed an ROI of 25%.<p></p><p>This year, the GiveWell staff mostly estimate 50% rate of investment and a 15% ROI. The rate of investment is lower than what is reported in GiveDirectly surveys (around 70%), and comes from somewhere in a jumble of econometric tables that I couldn't be bothered deciphering.</p><p>The ROI of 15% is estimated from the ROI from buying an iron roof, the most commonly-mentioned large investment made by GiveDirectly recipients. Reported ROI's for the iron rooves range from 7% to 23%, so the figure of 15% seems reasonable.</p><p>The result is that a donated dollar increases discounted consumption by 0.57%, down from my best guess of 0.96% last year. The 0.57% figure equates to a cost per life-saved equivalent of $18,000. (As was the case last year, I end up with cash transfers being more cost-effective than the GiveWell staff, because I use a lower discount rate than they do.)</p><p>That is a disappointingly high number, and it is worth reflecting on it for a bit. There have now been quite a few studies on various types of cash transfers, most of them finding much higher ROI's than 15%. GiveDirectly themselves apparently designed their plans around 25%. It is possible that as GD expands their programmes elsewhere, ROI's will improve; it's also possible (and this is what I suspect is more likely) that the fully hands-off approach by GD leads to lower returns than cash transfer programmes that put some conditions on the grants. (Of course the latter would require more overhead, but the differences in ROI are big.)</p><p>While I remain very positive about cash transfers, and so will continue to support GD as the leading cash transfer charity (I'm also a huge fan of their randomised rollouts, which lets us have this sort of discussion at all; they also experiment with the design of their transfers, also worth supporting), I am a little less positive about GD than I used to be.\n</p><h2 id=\"GiveWell_\">GiveWell?</h2>\nGiveWell still <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/20/update-on-givewells-funding-needs/\">has a funding gap</a>. I've seen people want to have discussions about the merits of donating to GiveWell directly, given that Good Ventures can fund them (the question is whether GiveWell should have a large, independent revenue source separate from GV), but I found it all very unsatisfying. It gets into the sort of governance issues that I really don't have a clue about.<p></p><p>I donated US$5000 to GiveWell today. I didn't overthink it, just made a decision.\n</p><h2 id=\"Conclusions\">Conclusions</h2>\n<ul>\n\t<li>GiveWell's cost-effectiveness spreadsheet with my inputs for deworming and cash transfers (in the 'DB' sheet) is <a href=\"http://pappubahry.com/charity/files/GiveWell_CEA_DB_deworming_cash_2013.xlsx\">here</a> (XLSX).</li>\n\t<li>Last year I had deworming as 1.7 times as cost-effective as cash transfers. This year I have it 2.5 times as cost-effective as GiveDirectly's cash transfers. All of these numbers are rubbery, of course, but it's enough for me to weight my giving more towards deworming this coming year.</li>\n\t<li>If we ignore the room-for-more-funding issue, AMF is an even more clear stand-out number 1 charity.</li>\n\t<li>There are strong arguments for delaying donations until the AMF situation becomes clearer. I suspect I will continue to support AMF at a reduced level this coming year. I'd be uncomfortable if the effective altruist community just stopped donating for a while, so I think I will continue my regular donations, with SCI getting the greatest share.</li>\n\t<li>Current plan for 2013 donation splits: SCI 40, AMF 30, GD 20, DtWI 10. That'll probably change.</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Crossposted from David Barry's <a href=\"http://pappubahry.livejournal.com/583528.html\">blog</a></em><p></p></div></div>"},

Many popular approaches simply <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/schools-are-not-the-key\">don't work</a>.\u00a0Many more approaches have simply never been investigated, beyond the stories and anecdotes.</p>\n<p>In the poorest parts of the world, people suffer from very different problems. A child may die of malaria for lack of a $10 bednet, or of diarrhea for lack of a 5-cent packet of nutrients.</p>\n<p>The table below illustrates the difference, comparing U.S.-focused charities to international charities.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n<td>\n<p>Organization</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cost</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Impact</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Developing-world health</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Against Malaria Foundation</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Approximately $3,400 per life saved</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Improve health, save lives</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Early childhood care and education (U.S.)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Nurse-Family Partnership</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>$10,000 per child served</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Increase academic performance and reduce criminal behavior</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>US Education</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>KIPP</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>$7,500-$17,000 per student per year (including state funds)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Improve academic performance</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Employment Assistance (NYC)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>The HOPE Program</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>$10,000 per client served</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Unclear, if any</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We estimate that it costs the Against Malaria Foundation <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/amf\">approximately $3,400</a> to save a human life.\u00a0This includes transportation, administration, etc. Compare that with even the best U.S. programs: the Nurse-Family Partnership and KIPP both cost over $10,000 per child served, and their impact is encouraging but not overwhelming.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that developing-world aid is easy or simple.

{"date": "8th Mar 2014", "title": "An argument for more effectual giving", "author": "Ben_Levinstein", "num_comments": "2 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>We say we give to charity to make the world and its inhabitants better off. Unfortunately, our actual giving habits rarely reflect much concern at all for how much good we do. If we were really giving selflessly, we\u2019d care a lot more about effectiveness than our habits indicate.</p><p>The Make-A-Wish Foundation\u2014a well-known and very well-financed charity\u2014provides once-in-a-lifetime experiences to people 17 and under living with serious illnesses. By its own account, it costs around <a href=\"http://wish.org/content/faq#How-much-does-granting-a-wish-cost\">$7,200</a> to fulfill the average request. In contrast, the Against Malaria Foundation\u2014a cause most have never heard of\u2014funds and distributes long lasting insecticidal nets in poor countries with a high prevalence of malaria. According to <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF\">independent sources</a>, it can save a life for a little under $2,400 on average, a price that likely beats that of any other organization.</p><p>Both are doing morally good work, and it\u2019s certainly better to give to either than spend money on a new Rolex. Still, it\u2019s a tragic waste to give to the former instead of the latter. To see why, think about how you\u2019d allocate your money when spending on people you care about. Imagine you have 4 children: Make-A-Wish raised over $180 million in contributions in 2012, while the Against Malaria Foundation received under $3 million that same year.Adam, Bob, Charles, and Dave. Adam has a terminal illness. He will surely die no matter what you do, so you hope to fulfill his lifelong dream of going to Disney World before he passes away. Bob, Charles, and Dave are also deathly ill. Unlike Adam, their diseases are curable, but treatment is expensive, and your funds are limited. You simply don\u2019t have enough money to save Bob, Charles, and Dave while providing for Adam\u2019s trip. Here are your options given your cruel financial realities: Deny Adam his wish and save your three remaining children, or send Adam to Disney World and let all four kids die. While the impulse to make Adam\u2019s final days more enjoyable is noble, it is\u2014in comparison to your other children\u2019s lives\u2014a frivolous luxury.</p><p>Similar reasoning should apply when it comes to strangers. I\u2019m not claiming that you ought to give as much to charity as you spend on caring for those close to you, but rather you should try to get the most out of your money in both cases. In the above example, terrible (and I hope hypothetical) as it may be, caring about your family\u2019s well being demands judicious allocation of funds. Likewise, if you really care about strangers and their children, even if to a much lesser extent, you\u2019ll try to maximize the good you do with each dollar you give. And until kids that would otherwise die for want of funding, you oughtn\u2019t waste money on providing luxuries to others, rather you should make every attempt to ensure your philanthropy is directed toward the very best causes.</p><p>Of course, it\u2019s not always easy to tell how or what maximizes the good or even what the good is. We should all agree, however, that saving actual lives is far better than making somebody happy for a few days. Nevertheless, Make-A-Wish raised over <a href=\"http://fy12annualreport.wish.org/our-finances/\">$180 million</a> in contributions in 2012, while the Against Malaria Foundation received under <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com/FinancialInformation.aspx\">$3 million</a> that same year.</p><p>Compassion demands we start using our heads to guide our hearts when giving. Instead of looking to causes that capture the public's attention such as Make-A-Wish, or basing philanthropic decisions on extraneous factors like CEO pay and overhead cost, we should be worrying about the bottom line: what charities give you the most moral bang for your buck? And what metrics are best in determining efficacy? If the task of researching charitable organizations sounds daunting, those in the '<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism\">Effective Altruist</a>' <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/smartgiving\">movement</a>, have already done most of the legwork for you. Websites such as <a href=\"http://thelifeyoucansave.org/\">The Life You Can Save</a>, <a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a>, and the especially in-depth and rigorous <a href=\"http://givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>, consolidate information about the reputation and impact of charitable organizations, report on the transparency of their finances, and rank causes on their overall effectiveness. So despite our wish to entertain the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uu2zpn82WI\">imagination</a> of young children going through hardship, when it comes to charity, it\u2019s the <a href=\"http://bigthink.com/users/katherinarosqueta\">consequences</a> that matter.</p><p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://vvvnt.com/media/effective-giving\">VVVNT</a></em></p></div></div>"},

Why does it favor them?\nWhat important causes is it missing? How do we want to address that?\nOur best measurement tool right now is RCTs. When do those not work? What can we use instead?\nWhat is the efficient amount of energy to put into evaluating efficacy? How do you decide?</p>\n\n<p>This is about the worst possible intro topic to EA, so we'll be doing a special \"intro to EA\" meeting for newbies.

How could we reform the way aid is given and used so is to make it more effective? Are there additional things besides aid that are needed or could be helpful?

{"date": "24th Feb 2014", "title": "End of year review of Effective Altruism Melbourne", "author": "RyanCarey", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em><strong>Co-written by Brayden Mclean and Ryan Carey</strong></em>\n</p><h2 id=\"Summary\">Summary</h2>\nFrom July to December 2013, Brayden McLean and Ryan Carey (the authors) built a new effective altruist community. We entered this process with only scraps of spare time in-between our full-time jobs, and the support of a few keen volunteers. We promoted this group using meetup.com, leafleting at talks by Peter Singer, and networking. Within a few months our Effective Altruist community was hosting multiple meetups per month, regularly attracting 20 or more attendees. At the same time as the founding of EA Melbourne, we escalated outreach efforts for the local LessWrong chapter, achieving similar successes in community building that we will refrain from elaborating on here. Management of EA Melbourne has been handed over to Helen Toner and Ruben Bloom as of January 2014.\n<h2 id=\"Inception\">Inception</h2>\nIn June 2013, Ryan received an email from Giving What We Can management. It said that central management had just received an email from Rangi de Silva, another Melbourne-based doctor interested in generating a <em>Giving What We Can</em> presence in Melbourne. <img title=\"The intial founding meeting\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/2/1/e/600_266141502.jpeg\">Ryan and Brayden gathered together a founding team with Stephanie McQualter from the <em>Monash Philosophy Society</em>, Frazer Kirkman, a mindfulness and wellbeing teacher, and Kathy, a developer and previous collaborator with <em>Leverage Research</em>. We met in a city caf\u00e9 on 30 June to plan what kind of chapter we might create. We stated overlapping sets of goals which centred on the following:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Enlarging Melbourne's rational altruistic social community</li>\n\t<li>Spreading the idea of effective altruism in Melbourne</li>\n\t<li>Improving the quality of discussion about effective interventions</li>\n\t<li>Gathering Melbournians who can collaborate on effective projects; and</li>\n\t<li>Encouraging people to travel to hubs of effective altruism in San Francisco and Oxford to get more involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"July\">July</h2>\nOn Friday 12th July, we held our first event, a <em>meet and greet</em> at the socially conscious bar <em>Shebeen</em>. There were 15-20 attendees, mostly aged in their twenties. About half were known from Lesswrong or from the founders meeting, while the rest were new. The event went well, and there was lots of discussion of further potential projects. As a result, we were very busy in the month of August, implementing the following projects:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Presenting at the <em>Global Ideas Forum</em> (Will MacAskill presenting by Skype, and Ryan presenting in person)<img title=\"Ryan presenting at the Global Ideas Forum\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/t31/q71/s720x720/1147690_10151816106191578_1518352134_o.jpg\">\nHosting a stall at the Giving Games, with posters sponsored by Matt Fallshaw\u2019s Trike Apps, and with a <em>Giving Games</em> for all delegates of the <em>Global Ideas Forum</em>.</li>\n\t<li>Presenting on Effective Altruism to a class of 30 at <em>Powershift</em>, a youth climate activist summit</li>\n\t<li>Leafleting two of Peter Singer's talks collaboratively with <em>The Life You Can Save</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"August_to_October\">August to October</h2>\n<em>The Life You Can Save Melbourne</em> had arranged for Peter Singer to give a talk to 500 people at the Melbourne Writers Festival. Prior to this event, <em>The Life You Can Save</em> Melbourne and <em>Giving What We Can</em> Melbourne decided to collaborate under the <em>EA Melbourne</em> banner to distribute leaflets together.\nWe continued to experiment with different event formats, advertising a discussion dinner before Peter Singer\u2019s Melbourne Writers festival talk during our initial leafleting. <img title=\"warming up for a lecture at the Edge lecture theatre\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/b/f/a/600_274707642.jpeg\">Peter himself made an appearance at the dinner, meeting with our core group of attendees.<p></p><p>In parallel with our outreach efforts, we started looking into other projects that we had some comparative advantage while being located in Melbourne:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>Ben Toner began to investigate the why the Against Malaria Foundation had so far failed twice in its applications for Australian tax deductibility status and how this might be achieved later, with limited success.</li>\n\t<li>A small group experimented with the mind-mapping software utilised by Leverage Research, with no great effect.<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/6/6/8/600_274710312.jpeg\"></li>\n\t<li>Helen Toner was interviewed on community radio and answered listener\u2019s questions on the topic of effective altruism.</li>\n\t<li>We attended a talk by Julian Savulescu and met for dinner afterwards.</li>\n\t<li>We hosted our first interstate guest, Brenton Mayer, a <em>Giving What We Can</em> member, and who had participated in the <em>Run for Better Days</em>, who spoke to the community at a dinner and discussion night.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"The_branding_pivot\">The branding pivot</h2>\nAround this time, Brayden, Helen and Ryan, who were now managing the group met to discuss ongoing strategy. It was suggested that the <em>Giving What We Can</em> brand that we had previously been emphasising did not necessarily best represent the group and its activities. There was a mixed degree of interest in poverty alleviation, some notion that the group was more interested in career choice and research than in monetary donation, only a couple of participants had pledged ten per cent and no one had newly signed the GWWC pledge as a result of our activities <em>Giving What We Can Melbourne</em>. <img alt=\"Brenton presenting to EA Melbourne\" src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/8/6/600_290643462.jpeg\"> Moreover, the group identified more strongly with the broader Effective Altruist label than with <em>Giving What We Can</em> in particular. Based on this assessment, a provisional decision was made to continue our efforts under the name <em>Effective Altruism Melbourne</em>. Subsequently, we have not run any further events under the <em>Giving What We Can Melbourne</em> brand.\n<h2 id=\"Maintenance___November_to_January\">Maintenance - November to January</h2>\nWe continued to run events after this, and quickly found a popular and repeatable combination of event formats that required less overheads. These continued at a decreased frequency of two per month. During this period we held an all day brunch fundraiser and social mixer event at Brayden\u2019s rationalist sharehouse, and two telepresentations, one by Geoff Anders from Leverage Research, and another by Jess Whittlestone from 80,000 hours.\n<h2 id=\"Succession\">Succession</h2>\nAt January 2013, it was noted that Ryan would be travelling overseas for the duration of 2014 and that Brayden would be travelling to the Bay Area for three months. <img title=\"Paul and Katja visiting EA Melbourne\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/6/b/2/600_331214002.jpeg\">Thus if <em>Effective Altruism Melbourne</em> would continue into 2014, someone new would have to take responsibility for maintaining its ongoing operations. We met with Helen Toner and Ruben Bloom to assist them in setting their goals and mission that they will bring to the community. This new team is off to a great start by starting a regular monthly lunch meetup that is displayed along with other events on an online calendar. Since the inaugural lunch discussion group, they have hosted effective altruist researchers Katja Grace and Paul Christiano, and have since filed a lecture hall at a presentation by Julia and Anna from CFAR.\n<h2 id=\"Impact\">Impact</h2>\nI will now discuss to what extent <em>Effective Altruism Melbourne</em> achieved each of its goals using examples of events that seemed to succeed and events that didn\u2019t.<p></p><p>Enlarging Melbourne's rational altruistic social community\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>we gathered a regular group of attendees of effective altruists from our friends, family, acquaintances, networking at relevant conferences, LessWrong, the universities\u2019 philosophy societies, the universities\u2019 secular societies, and online meetup groups.</li>\n\t<li>there seemed to be a very positive effect from the growth of the LessWrong community (from 20 to 50 individuals) on <em>Effective Altruism Melbourne</em> and vice versa. There is a &gt;50% overlap of attendees between these two communities, so it becomes difficult to split up</li>\n</ul>\nSpreading the idea of effective altruism in Melbourne.\n<ul>\n\t<li>We didn\u2019t get any new pledges for <em>Giving What We Can</em>, although a few new individuals pledged to 80,000 Hours due to the existence of effective altruism in Melbourne</li>\n\t<li>Talks by Will Crouch, Geoff Anders and Jess Whittlestone were delivered via teleconference, and Ryan presented in person. These talks seemed well understood, and were discussed in more detail e.g. each Geoff and Jess, who had question time, responded to half an hour\u2019s worth of intelligent questions from new and old members alike, and then the topics of their talk dominated conversation for half an hour afterward.</li>\n\t<li>In her interview on community radio, Helen explained effective altruism clearly and with a good manner. As is unfortunately the risk with broad outreach events, we don\u2019t have clear evidence that the show did good \u2013 none of our new members indicated hearing about the group on the meetup.com sign up question.</li>\n\t<li>Presenting at Powershift conference \u2013 attendees politely listened through Brayden and Ryans 15 minute presentation on effective altruism, but had a much lower degree of interest in our discussion and understanding of it than the global health crowd at Global Ideas Forum. <img title=\"Brayden and Rangi at the Giving Games stall at the Global Ideas Forum\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://scontent-b-pao.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t1/21423_10151816091366578_1015413555_n.jpg\"></li>\n\t<li>The <em>Giving Games</em> was useful as a quick and memorable way of transferring ideas. Participants seemed to understand that comparing charities is difficult, and that it depends upon the degree of need of recipients, the good done by a charity relative to the size of its budget, and other factors.</li>\n</ul>\nImproving the quality of discussion about effective interventions\n<ul>\n\t<li>It\u2019s not clear that the existence of <em>Effective Altruism Melbourne</em> has contributed greatly to this goal. Ryan and Helen are having ongoing discussions about the most up-to-date research from each of the EA organisations, but much of the rest of the community, including some of the core members, are heavily engaged in business activities, and so they prefer to focus on their job \u2013 their comparative advantage \u2013 while leaving the charity evaluation to others. The broader community, including many new members, are starting to read more articles and post occasional comments in the EA facebook group. Helen aims to build up deeper understanding of EA ideas by collating important blog pieces and papers monthly for discussion at the regular lunch event. This is the first activity to directly target this goal.</li>\n\t<li>The core members think they have better altruistic career plans than previously, although this is hard to prove.</li>\n</ul>\nGathering Melbournians who can collaborate on effective projects\n<ul>\n\t<li>Ben is reaching the end of his investigation of the feasibility of achieving tax deductibility status for the Against Malaria Foundation.</li>\n\t<li>Ben, Brayden and Ryan did ~ 10 hour each of goal factoring sessions, as a spin-off of Leverage Research\u2019s Connection Theory, but did not identify any insights into improving the process.</li>\n\t<li>Ryan and Brayden escalated their involvement with the creation of an effective altruist book, an effective altruist community blog, and some dot impact projects during this period. International collaboration picked up on these projects at the start of 2014.</li>\n</ul>\nEncouraging people to travel to hubs of effective altruism in San Francisco and Oxford to get more involved.\n<ul>\n\t<li>One Lesswrong community member travelled to San Francisco and came back intending to give 10 per cent of his income to charity. It\u2019s possible, but not probable that he would give ten per cent of his income without Effective Altruism Melbourne.</li>\n\t<li>Brenton Mayer visited Giving What We Can Oxford, something that he would not have done if not for Effective Altruism Melbourne.</li>\n\t<li>Brayden remained confident in the decision to move to the Bay Area for 3 months.</li>\n\t<li>Helen made a trip to the Bay Area</li>\n\t<li>Ryan visited the Bay Area</li>\n\t<li>Eleven members of either Less Wrong Melbourne or Effective Altruism Melbourne signed up to attend one of the four day CFAR workshops in February 2014, which encouraged additional discussion of high impact ideas and getting involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Lessons_learned\">Lessons learned</h2>\nThree things that worked well:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Being <em>known</em> to central EA organisations. It's not essential to be a part of any particular body, but it's essential that when another resident of your city contacts Ben Clifford or Mark Lee to express their interest, then these central figures know to forward their email on to you. In a city of about 4 million residents like Melbourne, expect central EA organisations to collectively discover a new member who is interested in starting something around twice a year. Members found in this way are often very passionate and competent.</li>\n\t<li>Word of mouth: most of our most effective members were friends, acquaintances and family.</li>\n\t<li>Subscribing to meetup.com: this was the only effective public outreach strategy. At each event, we had around 5 attendees who discovered the meetup through meetup.com, about half of whom were new on each occasion. These people often were interested in ideas related to effective altruism, including animal welfare, global poverty reduction, social entrepreneurship, and so on. Members who discovered the group through meetup.com were about ~ 5 times less likely to attend events than members who were introduced through friends, however 2 of the 11 attendees from the community at the CFAR workshop originally discovered the community through meetup, so the ability to find highly committed members through this medium should not be underrated (especially in cities where there is a dearth of events for rational or intelletual altruistic individuals)</li>\n</ul>\nThree things that worked badly:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Mailing list: we maintained a mailing list of about a hundred emails of people who we met in passing, and who signed up to our sheet at conferences and during leafleting. This had a clickthrough rate of less than ten per cent and apparently yielded no new attendees.</li>\n\t<li>Leafleting Peter Singer's lectures: we got many emails written down on our notebooks at Peter Singer lectures, but these were not helpful, as previously described. Furthermore, we handed out hundreds of leaflets indicating the next effective altruist events. There were as many as four different leafleters, who had a mix of gender, age, and marketing ability. Despite this, even when the leaflets promoted a dinner on the very same day, we only got a few new attendees. We didn\u2019t do any further leafleting after this. <img title=\"Leafleting Peter Singer's Edge talk\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://scontent-b-pao.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/t31/q74/s720x720/1273249_10151816091501578_878522005_o.jpg\"></li>\n\t<li>Conference networking \u2013 although the Global Ideas Forum and Powershift (climate-change) conferences, were enjoyable, and appeared to offer opportunities for follow-up meetings or presentations, we regret that we did not follow-up on these, other than to invite atendees to our meetups.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"A_final_note_on_Actually_Doing_Things\">A final note on <em>Actually Doing Things</em></h2>\nOrganising your first effective altruist event should take no more than two hours of organisation. It just takes a few people to sit down and <em>do it</em>. We are proud that we avoided analysis paralysis by implementing a simple plan. In doing so, we gathered information that should be useful for the rest of the effective altruism movement.

The project aims:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>To grow the effective altruism community by increasing the number of people who self-identify as effective altruists.</li>\n\t<li>To strengthen the effective altruism community, by:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Increasing the level of engagement of self-identified EAs.</li>\n\t<li>Increasing the ability of those in the EA community to work together.</li>\n\t<li>Increasing the amount of external support for EA, funding for EA, and influence of EA.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\t<li>To prevent the EA movement from losing most of its value, for example by collapsing or stagnating.</li>\n</ul>\nUltimately, the project aims to grow Effective Altruism into a long-lasting social movement, and to make sure that that movement produces as much value as possible. \u00a0For a discussion of the value of these sorts of activities, see Peter Hurford\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/could-ea-community-building-be-an-easy-and-underfunded-win/\">post</a>.<p></p><p></p><p>In order to achieve these aims we are currently recruiting for people with the following skills:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Secretarial</strong>. \u00a0We are looking for an organised, conscientious and hard-working individual to help coordinate schedules, correspondence, travel and meetings.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Marketing</strong>. \u00a0We seek someone with expertise in marketing to help design and execute a promotion strategy around a high-profile international book launch, and around our wider effective altruism outreach.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Community building</strong>. \u00a0We would like to hire someone with a background in community building to build and strengthen the effective altruism community, and to allow that community to achieve more social impact.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Writing</strong>. \u00a0We hope to publish a couple of books in the near future, in addition to a number of op-eds and a regular column, and would like someone with good writing skills to help improve this work.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Web development</strong>. \u00a0We are also looking for someone to develop more online tools that would allow people to understand the ideas behind effective altruism quicker, and to translate their interest into impact more easily.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not be hiring for each of these roles individually. \u00a0Ideal candidates will have a mix of these skills and will be able to carry out two or more of these roles simultaneously. \u00a0The roles will report directly to the <a href=\"http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/team\">Director of Special Projects</a>, and will be working alongside <a href=\"http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/team\">William MacAskill</a>.</p>\n<p>If you think you would be a good fit for this project, but for different reasons than those listed above, then please do apply and explain in your application why you would like to work on this project. \u00a0We are open to alternative means of achieving the aims outlined above, and would be interested in applications from anyone with experience in this area whose aims align with our own.</p>\n<p>The starting salaries are between \u00a318,000 and \u00a340,000, depending on experience. \u00a0We are looking for someone to fill this role long-term; the performance of new hires is assessed at 3 and 6 months before they are made permanent employees.</p>\n<p>To apply to work on this project the application form can be found <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Z2V9juGx0UmydzLGK3zJvelbuQEnso0UdbhYLh5AAQA/viewform\">here</a>. \u00a0If you have any questions about the role, please do not hesitate to get in touch with Niel Bowerman at niel [dot] bowerman [at] centre for effective altruism [dot] org. \u00a0If you have questions about the application process, please contact Tom Ash at tom [dot] ash [at] centre for effective altruism [dot] org.</p><p></p></div></div>"},

We have a whole page explaining <a href=\"http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/careers/why-work-with-us\">why CEA is an excellent place to work</a>, but a key reason that you\u2019re part of a team of interesting, driven and passionate colleagues, working together to make the world a better place. The work is exciting and varied, and will likely be one of the highest-impact things you could do.<p></p><p>Apply for jobs by 5pm GMT on February the 28th using <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Z2V9juGx0UmydzLGK3zJvelbuQEnso0UdbhYLh5AAQA/viewform\">this form</a>. You can apply for internships <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UOrtl2KUvuEF041_TsbJ9iKy6JgkpAhbRPvjr33AaNs/viewform\">here</a>; you will be more likely to be offered an internship if you apply by the same deadline, but we welcome applications after it too. For more information about the roles, see below, or see the full descriptions on our <a href=\"http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/careers\">recruitment page</a>.\n</p><h3 id=\"Director_of_Development_for_CEA\">Director of Development for CEA</h3>\nCEA is a young and rapidly growing charity which has grown to a \u00a3300,000 annual budget over 18 months. In this role you\u2019ll principally be fundraising for the two innovative organisations that are part of CEA: 80,000 Hours and Giving What We Can. We also have a track record of incubating new charitable projects, and are continuing to expand into new areas.<p></p><p>In order to meet its growth targets CEA has set the ambitious goal of raising an extra \u00a3150,000 over the next year. Currently CEA is funded primarily by \u2018high net worth\u2019 individuals, but also by a number of medium-sized donors and grants. For this role we are interested in people with previous experience in fundraising, in particular the following activities:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>Writing fundraising materials (e.g. pitching projects)</li>\n\t<li>Grant writing</li>\n\t<li>Identifying, establishing and building relationships with major donors</li>\n\t<li>More general donor relationship management.</li>\n</ul>\nThe ideal candidate would also have a degree, be a fast and compelling writer, cope well with stress, and be keen to work with a young team in a startup environment.\n<h3 id=\"Director_of_Community_at_Giving_What_We_Can\">Director of Community at Giving What We Can</h3>\nGiving What We Can is looking for an exceptional candidate to lead its outreach to existing and potential members. We have found that in order to be willing to pledge to give 10% of their income for the rest of their lives, people need personal contact with a friendly member of staff who can answer their questions and introduce them to other people doing the same. The right person for this job would be extroverted, friendly, and excited about talking to up to 20 people each week about giving to cost-effective charities or taking our 10% giving pledge.\n<h3 id=\"Lead_Developer_at_80_000_Hours\">Lead Developer at 80,000 Hours</h3>\nWe\u2019ve got an exciting opportunity to become a core member of the 80,000 Hours team. We\u2019re looking for someone to join us in a full-time paid position as a lead developer, helping 80,000 Hours drive forward its mission to help thousands of people identify and take high leverage ways to have a social impact. In this role you would:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Use Ruby on Rails to build our website as an engaging online platform for people to learn about our research.</li>\n\t<li>Help develop new products, such as a career network or an interactive careers guide.</li>\n\t<li>Be involved in other parts of 80,000 Hours</li>\n\t<li>Manage volunteers, interns and contractors to work on tech and design.</li>\n\t<li>There may also be the opportunity to work more broadly with the Centre for Effective Altruism, helping to foster new high-impact tech projects.</li>\n</ul>\nThe role is highly flexible, and we\u2019ll tailor it to your skills, interests and development aims. For this role we are interested in people with previous experience in web development, and in particular people with experience in Ruby on Rails.\n<h3 id=\"Careers_Analyst_at_80_000_Hours\">Careers Analyst at 80,000 Hours</h3>\nWe also have another exciting opportunity to become a core member of the 80,000 Hours team. We\u2019re looking for someone to join us in a full time paid position as a Careers Analyst, helping us in our mission through providing high quality high impact careers guidance. In this role you would:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Give one-on-one coaching to amazing people who want to change the world, as part of our <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/coaching/overview\">case studies</a></li>\n\t<li>Do research into \ufb01nding the <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/research/overview\">most promising career opportunities in the world</a></li>\n\t<li>Promote our research in the international <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/media\">media</a>, online and through other outreach</li>\n\t<li>Monitor our impact.</li>\n</ul>\nThe role is also highly flexible, and we\u2019ll tailor it to your skills, interests and development aims.<p></p><p>For this role we are particularly interested in people with knowledge of economics.\n</p><h3 id=\"Suggest_your_own_role_\">Suggest your own role!</h3>\nWe\u2019re aware that there are probably things we need, that we don\u2019t yet know we need, so if there\u2019s any way in which you think you could help us, we\u2019d also love to hear from you! We provide an 'open application' option on our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Z2V9juGx0UmydzLGK3zJvelbuQEnso0UdbhYLh5AAQA/viewform\">jobs form</a>, in which you can ask to be considered for roles other than those advertised. As CEA is rapidly growing, even if we don\u2019t have anything for you right now, there will likely be more roles available soon - so it\u2019s well worth getting your CV in.\n<h3 id=\"Internships_on_our_Graduate_Volunteer_Scheme\">Internships on our Graduate Volunteer Scheme</h3>\nBoth Giving What We Can and 80,000 Hours are looking for talented and enthusiastic people to volunteer with us full-time in Oxford. We run a Graduate Volunteer Scheme on which you can intern with us for several months. We can often provide accommodation and expenses to ensure that you\u2019re not left out of pocket. As a Graduate Volunteer, there are lots of different areas to work on, and there\u2019s plenty of flexibility to adjust the role so it plays to your strengths and development aims. We make it our responsibility to ensure your time here allows you to grow as much as possible, as well as just being lots of fun! We\u2019re looking for hardworking individuals with a strong desire for personal development who are deeply interested in making the world a better place in an effective way.<p></p><p>See <a href=\"http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/careers/graduate-volunteer-scheme\">here</a> for more details about the scheme. If you would be interested in interning with us, please <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UOrtl2KUvuEF041_TsbJ9iKy6JgkpAhbRPvjr33AaNs/viewform\">let us know via this form</a>.\n</p><h3 id=\"Two_week_internships_on_Giving_What_We_Can_s_September_development_programme\">Two week internships on Giving What We Can's September development programme</h3>\nGiving What We Can is running a development programme for students interested in promoting effective charitable giving. In this two week period (15th-26th September 2014) interns will gain training and experience in the area of their choice; either cost-effectiveness Research or Communications.

The first two have been recommended\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/11/26/our-top-charities-for-the-2012-giving-season/\">previously</a>.</p>\n<p>The third is a new addition, and we encourage readers to see our\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative\">full review</a>.\u00a0We\u2019ve had extensive internal discussions about how to rank these three giving opportunities against each other. These discussions have been particularly challenging this year because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The three have extremely different strengths and weaknesses, in our view. Much of the decision between them comes down to judgment calls about how to weigh factors such as (a) estimated cost-effectiveness of a charity\u2019s activities (SCI appears strongest here, in isolation, though some staff discount this observation because of the low robustness of our estimates); (b) potential\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/16/leverage-in-charity/\">leverage</a>\u00a0(DtWI has a potential advantage here, as it focuses on influencing government spending rather than covering all costs with its own funds); (c) a direct and robust case for impact (we believe GiveDirectly is strongest on this front); (d) \u201cupside,\u201d in terms of potential for the charity\u2019s growth to have far-reaching effects beyond the direct impact of its services. (We think all three have some \u201cupside\u201d but see GiveDirectly as particularly promising in terms of its potential to improve the aid community\u2019s understanding of, and interest in, cash transfer programs.)</li>\n<li>The amounts of money given on the strength of our recommendations could be substantial, and so the question of \u201cwhat do further donations accomplish?\u201d can have complex answers: for example, the first million dollars to a charity can be quite different in their expected impact from the second million. We lay out what we know about each charity\u2019s funding gap below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For each charity, we have set out a \u201cminimum target\u201d that we very much hope to see it raise. The targets have no precision to them, but roughly speaking, we see more value in donations up to the minimum target for\u00a0each\u00a0charity than in donations beyond the minimum target for\u00a0any\u00a0of them. (In other words, if two of the charities had hit their minimum target and the third had not, we would prefer additional donations to go to the third charity until it hit its minimum target.) We believe that each charity will hit its minimum target. We would also be happy to see each charity raise funds beyond its minimum target, and expect that this will happen to some degree.</p>\n<p>The minimum targets consider both the nature of the funding gap and the goal of providing positive incentives via rewarding charities that exemplify the values GiveWell is seeking to promote, such as transparency, strong monitoring and evaluation, and full participation in GiveWell\u2019s evaluation process. We believe that all three top charities are outstanding in these\u00a0respects and thus hope to move substantial funds to each, though we also feel there are some differences on this front that contribute to our differing minimum targets.</p>\n<p>When it comes to donations beyond the minimum target, we haven\u2019t reached a clear conclusion on which charities should be prioritized, and feel that donors will decide \u2013 reasonably accurately \u2013 which charities are the best fit for their own worldview and values with the guidance we provide. Accordingly, we have decided <strong>not to provide numerical rankings this year</strong>.</p>\n<p>Please note that there will be some additional content coming out within the next 1-2 weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.goodventures.org/\">Good Ventures</a>\u00a0is planning to announce its own plans re: grants to top charities.\u00a0<strong>We expect this announcement to come this week\u00a0and expect that it may influence donors\u2019 choices</strong>. [Ed: this was the <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/03/good-ventures-matching-gift-to-givedirectly-and-grants-to-top-charities/\">announcement</a> that they would match donations to GiveDirectly]</li>\n<li>We are planning to write about the evolution of our\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/criteria\">criteria for recommending charities</a>, which are being modified from what they were in previous years. This content will not be directly relevant to the choice\u00a0between\u00a0charities (this post attempts to summarize all relevant considerations).</li>\n<li>We are also planning to have individual staff members (who feel comfortable doing so) announce their plans and their reasoning for their own personal giving. In general, the most popular choice internally is GiveDirectly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The rest of this post lays out what we see as the key considerations regarding the funding gap, strengths and weaknesses of each recommended charity.</p>\n<div>\n<h1 id=\"Give_Directly\">Give Directly</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2 id=\"Funding_gap\">Funding gap</h2>\n</div>\n<p>GiveDirectly We provide the details of GiveDirectly\u2019s funding gap in our\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly#Roomformorefunding\">review</a>. In brief, GiveDirectly has told us that, to facilitate its planning, it aims to raise $40 million, the amount it budgets for 2014 and 2015. It hopes to spend $14 million in 2014 and $26 million in 2015.</p>\n<p>As of the writing of this blog post, GiveDirectly has allocated or committed over $5 million to cash transfer campaigns (the vast majority of these funds in the past year), utilizing most of the funds it has received to date from donors.</p>\n<p>Our understanding is that the majority of additional donations will go directly to cash transfers, which themselves are part of GiveDirectly\u2019s (a) experimentation with its operational model as it expands and (b) experiments into the impacts of different models of cash transfer programs.</p>\n<p>We hope that GiveDirectly is able to close a sizable portion of its funding gap, and have set a \u201cminimum target\u201d of $2.5 million, about half of what it has spent in the last year. We would be relatively comfortable with its receiving up to $20 million, though as it received more funds we would begin to prefer that those funds be allocated elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Details on GiveDirectly\u2019s room for more funding</p>\n<h2 id=\"Strengths_and_Weaknesses\">Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Program impact and cost-effectiveness.</strong>\u00a0Cash transfers are relatively strongly evidence-backed, and are in the range of our other priority programs\u2019 cost-effectiveness, but our best guess is that cash transfers are 2-3x less cost-effective than the deworming programs carried out by SCI. Details at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/2013%20GiveWell%20Cost%20effectiveness%20analysis%20final.xlsx\">our updated cost-effectiveness spreadsheet</a>. Our estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty.</li>\n<li><strong>Monitoring and evaluation.</strong>\u00a0All the programs implemented by our\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/01/givewells-top-charities-for-giving-season-2013/charities/top-charities\">top charities</a>\u00a0are evidence-backed, but GiveDirectly is the only one that has a randomized controlled trial (finding strong results) of its own implementation of its program. Thus, GiveDirectly has been evaluated in a more rigorous way than our other top charities. We also feel that we have seen stronger evidence of successful execution of its program than for our other top charities.</li>\n<li><strong>Directness and robustness of the case for impact.</strong>\u00a0We believe there is a highly direct and robust connection between GiveDirectly\u2019s receiving funds and those funds reaching very poor individuals. We believe GiveDirectly to be the strongest of the recommended charities on this front.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency and participation in our process.\u00a0</strong>GiveDirectly has been exceptionally open with us, enabling us to understand the full details of its work.</li>\n<li><strong>Scale.\u00a0</strong>Were GiveDirectly to receive the full level of support it is seeking, this would result in a significant increase in scale. We view this both as a risk and an opportunity. As of the end of 2013, GiveDirectly was distributing cash at a rate of approximately $3.6 million per year; it hopes to reach close to $15 million by the end of 2014. GiveDirectly has scaled up successfully in the past; it had been distributing cash at a rate of $360,000 per year at the end of 2012. For donors who believe GiveDirectly can effectively scale up, this represents an opportunity to provide early-stage funding to an organization that may eventually grow to be much larger. For donors who are skeptical of GiveDirectly\u2019s ability to scale, providing such funds may appear unreasonably risky (though only after the first $5-10 million in support; the first $5-10 million would be consistent with the size GiveDirectly has been to date).\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly\">Full GiveDirectly review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"Schistosomiasis_Control_Initiative__SCI_\">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI)</h1>\n<h2 id=\"Funding_gap1\">Funding gap</h2>\n<p>SCI has told us that it hopes to raise at least $4 million for work it plans to undertake in 2014 and believes it could effectively absorb up to $10 million (though some of this spending would spread into 2015). This work would mostly consist of direct implementation of deworming.</p>\n<p>Since November 2011, when we first recommended SCI, SCI has received approximately $4.6 million in unrestricted funds. It has spent $2.9 million, committed an additional $1.2 million and approximately $1 million remains unallocated, including approximately $500,000 it had in reserve prior to our recommendation (<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative/updates/October-2013#Activitiesfundedwithunrestrictedfunds\">more</a>).</p>\n<p>We have set a \u201cminimum target\u201d of $1 million for SCI, which is consistent with the levels of GiveWell-attributable funding it has received in the past. We would be relatively comfortable with its receiving up to $10 million, though as it received more funds we would begin to prefer that those funds be allocated elsewhere.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative#Roomformorefunds\">Details of SCI\u2019s room for more funding</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative#Roomformorefunds\"></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"Strengths_and_Weaknesses1\">Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Program impact and cost-effectiveness.</strong>\u00a0Our best guess is that SCI\u2019s deworming program is more cost-effective than cash transfers by a factor of 2-3x and 1-2x as cost-effective as DtWI\u2019s deworming program. Details at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/2013%20GiveWell%20Cost%20effectiveness%20analysis%20final.xlsx\">our updated cost-effectiveness spreadsheet</a>. Our estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty.</li>\n<li><strong>Monitoring and evaluation.\u00a0</strong>We recently\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/29/rethinking-scis-evidence-of-impact-2/\">became aware of major limitations</a>\u00a0to the studies we had previously been relying on as evidence of SCI\u2019s impact. We will be reviewing further evidence that SCI sent us in response; we had not previously focused on collecting such evidence because of our impression that the studies we were using were sufficient. The program SCI works on (<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming\">deworming</a>) is relatively strongly evidence-backed.</li>\n<li><strong>Directness and robustness of the case for impact.\u00a0</strong>We believe that the connection between SCI\u2019s receiving funds and those funds\u2019 reaching very poor individuals is more direct than DtWI\u2019s but less direct than GiveDirectly\u2019s. SCI has spent (and plans to spend) a sizable amount of its budget directly carrying out deworming programs, but it also spends funds on a variety of activities related to deworming (e.g., advocacy, operational research).</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency and participation in our process.\u00a0</strong>From 2009 (when we first made contact with SCI) through mid-2013, we struggled to communicate well with SCI. Since August 2013, our communication with has SCI has improved substantially. We still do not feel that we have the same level of visibility into SCI\u2019s operations as we do into those of our other top charities, and this is a major factor in the relatively lower \u201cminimum target\u201d we have set for SCI as opposed to other top charities, though we are optimistic that this will change in the next year.</li>\n<li><strong>Scale.\u00a0</strong>Were SCI to receive $5 million, it would represent an increase in the amount of funding it processes. SCI has spent (or committed) approximately $2 million in unrestricted funds in each of the past two years and is currently primarily funded by a 5-year, ~$15 million grant from DFID. It is currently under consideration for a 4-year, $15-18 million grant from DFID. In sum, SCI has been operating at a level of approximately $6 million/year and may soon be operating at a level of approximately $10 million/year (due to the DFID grant). An additional $5-10 million would increase its scale further.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative\">Full SCI review</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"Deworm_the_World_Initiative__led_by_Evidence_Action__DtWI_\">Deworm the World Initiative, led by Evidence Action (DtWI)</h1>\n<h2 id=\"Funding_gap2\">Funding gap</h2>\n<p>DtWI has told us that it would like to receive $2-3 million to give it the flexibility to pursue opportunities that are not directly funded by other donors. It has also told us that Evidence Action, its parent organization, has a funding gap over the next 2 years of $5-7 million.</p>\n<p>Because our analysis has focused on DtWI, we have focused on its funding gap.</p>\n<p>We would like\u00a0to see DtWI close much or all of its gap so that it can have an adequate supply of unrestricted funding, and we have set a minimum target of $2 million. We see significantly less value in funds beyond that point, and particularly past the $3 million mark.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative#Roomformorefunds\">Details of DtWI\u2019s room for more funding</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"Strengths_and_Weaknesses2\">Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Program impact and cost-effectiveness.</strong>\u00a0In isolation, our best guess is that DtWI\u2019s deworming program is likely less cost effective than SCI\u2019s (about 50-100% as cost effective) and GiveWell staff differ about its cost-effectiveness relative to cash transfers (1.5-3x as cost effective). This is because worm infections appear less prevalent and (particularly) less intense where DtWI works than where SCI works. However, DtWI focuses on influencing government spending rather than covering all costs with its own funds, and we think it is therefore appropriate to give it some degree of credit for \u201cleverage\u201d \u2013 making your dollars go further than they otherwise would. Estimating the degree of \u201cleverage\u201d is highly subjective; our best guess is that it should add a multiplier of about 3 to the cost-effectiveness, making DtWI more than competitive with other top charities on this front. Details at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/2013%20GiveWell%20Cost%20effectiveness%20analysis%20final.xlsx\">our updated cost-effectiveness spreadsheet</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Monitoring and evaluation.</strong>\u00a0We believe DtWI\u2019s self-evaluation to have been less rigorous than that of GiveDirectly, though we are hopeful that it will improve going forward. (As noted above, we are currently revisiting the quality of SCI\u2019s self-evaluation.)</li>\n<li><strong>Directness and robustness of the case for impact.\u00a0</strong>DtWI is a technical assistance/advocacy organization, and therefore the chain from donation to person helped is the least direct of any of our top charities. This is the flip side of DtWI\u2019s potential \u201cleverage\u201d \u2013 because it focuses on influencing and assisting other players rather than on direct implementation, its value-added per dollar spent is quite plausibly higher but also harder to pin down.</li>\n<li><strong>Quality of communication.\u00a0</strong>From 2009 (when we first made contact) through early 2013, we struggled to communicate well with DtWI. Since early 2013 (which coincided with DtWI changing its leadership), our ability to communicate with DtWI improved substantially. We now feel that we have as much visibility into DtWI\u2019s operations as we do any of our other top charities.</li>\n<li><strong>Scale.</strong>\u00a0Our understanding is that $2-3 million in unrestricted funds will provide DtWI with flexibility that will be helpful as it grows. Because DtWI requests $2-3 million, we would expect that any funds it receives above $2-3 million would likely effectively support Evidence Action more broadly (e.g., its Dispensers for Safe Water program, which we have not examined although we have published a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/water-quality\">report on water quality interventions</a>, and potentially other initiatives that it might launch).</li>\n<li><strong>Fungibility.\u00a0</strong>DtWI is an initiative led by its parent organization, Evidence Action. There is some possibility that funds given due to this recommendation effectively support Evidence Action and its Dispensers for Safe Water program (or future initiatives) rather than DtWI. If donors are particularly concerned about this, they should carefully consider their support of DtWI.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative\">Full DtWI review</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative\"></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"A_note_on_Against_Malaria_Foundation__AMF_\">A note on Against Malaria Foundation (AMF)</h1>\n<p>As discussed\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/26/change-in-against-malaria-foundation-recommendation-status-room-for-more-funding-related/\">in this blog post</a>, we are not recommending AMF to donors this year due to lack of short-term room for more funding.
