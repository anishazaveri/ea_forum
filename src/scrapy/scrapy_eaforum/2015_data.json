They only have<a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/People.aspx\">two full-time staff</a>, yet according to GiveWell    <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/04/03/top-charities-room-for-more-funding/\">their 2015 room for more funding was around $5M</a>. This suggests that     a very high talent EA direct worker could generate as much as $2.5M for earning-to-give people to attempt to fill with donations.</p>\n<p>Give Directly <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/team.html\">has 25 staff</a> and has a room for more funding of somewhere between $1M to $25M (with the     potential for much more), which is somewhere between $40K to &gt;$1M per staff member.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_How_Much_Do_People_Earn_to_Give_\"> How Much Do People Earn to Give?</strong></p>\n<p>80K <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2014/04/how-much-do-people-pursuing-earning-to-give-actually-give/\">found in their 2014 survey</a> that people doing     earning-to-give were donating on average $13K/year for 2013, with an expectation to rise to $56K/year within three years if people's plans are taken at     face value. <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/07/update-how-many-extra-donations-have-we-caused/\">A follow-up in 2015</a> found a new average of     $16.5K/year for 2014, though for a more limited sample.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/sites/effectivealtruismhub.com/files/survey/2014/results-and-analysis.pdf\">According to the EA Survey</a> (focused on 2013 data), the mean donation in our sample from EAs who met the criteria for earning-to-give (&gt;=$60K annual income and &gt;=10% donations)     was $9.5K/year.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Now_Let_s_Do_Math\"> Now Let\u2019s Do Math</strong></p>\n<p>Using the best possible numbers for earning-to-give, imagine that an additional direct work person was like the AMF staff and generated $2.5M in donation     opportunity. Now imagine I took the low value of earning-to-give, $9.5K/year. Using these two numbers, it would take 263 people earning to give to match     one person doing direct work, suggesting that 99.6% of people should earn-to-give.</p>\n<p>If instead I look at GiveDirectly\u2019s low number of $40K per staff member compared to a high value of earning-to-give ($56K/year), I calculate you need 1     person earning to give for every 1.4 people doing direct work, suggesting a ratio of 29%.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_The_Problem_With_Funding_Salaries\"> The Problem With Funding Salaries</strong></p>\n<p>Of course, it does seem clear that marginal direct workers won\u2019t be as productive at creating earning-to-give opportunity as AMF staff have been, so there     will be less to fund per marginal direct worker.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, AMF may not be typical of charities marginal direct workers are moving into. Charities like CEA or MIRI scale not by creating opportunities to     fund programs, but rather through hiring staff, and this ends up with a lower amount of donation opportunity to staff member (equal to their salary).</p>\n<p>Still, even if we expect earning-to-give people to be primarily focused on funding salaries, we may need more than 15%. Consider the classic story of ETG     who takes a job in finance to fund two direct workers, doubling their impact. First, if salaries + overhead per staff are ~$50K/yr (though they can be much     lower), a 15% earning to give ratio would require the average earning to give donation to be over $330K, which seems unrealistically high, even for the     next three years. A more realistic ratio where the average (not median) earning-to-give person donates $50K/year (still more than is currently happening)     would be 1:1, or 50%.</p>\n<p>Second, the AMF model should not be ignored when thinking about donation opportunity created per marginal direct worker, and it\u2019s quite possible that in     some scenarios we may need many earning-to-give people to support the opportunities created. It\u2019s an open question what proportion of EA resources should     be going to GiveWell\u2019s scalable health charities, which often generate millions of dollars in donation opportunity per employee, than other EA orgs where     the donation opportunity per employee is quite less. Those who think the majority of EA funding should focus on GiveWell\u2019s top charities, or that GiveWell     top charities should be the default giving opportunity for the typical donor absent good reason to donate elsewhere, should also be far more inclined to     think that more people should earn-to-give.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"EA_Orgs_Have_More_Room_For_More_Funding_Than_People_Are_Giving_Credit_For\">EA Orgs Have More Room For More Funding Than People Are Giving Credit For</h2>\n<p>Recently I\u2019ve been involved in some EA projects that I\u2019ve wanted to fundraise for. On three occasions with three separate EAs the reaction was always \u201cHuh,     I\u2019m really surprised that hasn\u2019t been funded already.\u201d ...And many of those projects still need money.</p>\n<p>There is supposed to be an explosion in earning to give. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s arrived quite yet. From my point of view many plausibly important projects     still want more funding.</p>\n<p>Just to mention a few projects I\u2019m aware of --</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>According to Jacy\u2019s speech at EA Global, <a href=\"http://animalcharityevaluators.org\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a> is quite funding constrained             and would hire more researchers if they had the money.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://intelligence.org/\">The Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> believes they could have as much as $5.5M in room for more funding            <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2015/07/17/miris-2015-summer-fundraiser/\">according to their fundraiser</a> (though I don\u2019t know if they think of             themselves as funding constrained or not).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com\">Charity Science</a> feels talent constrained but also could really use more money for planned expansions we can\u2019t afford yet.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Some people close to <a href=\"http://gbs-switzerland.org/\">GBS Switzerland</a> told me they feel funding constrained.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Several projects currently going through <a href=\"http://eaventures.org\">EA Ventures</a> have not yet raised the funding that they wanted.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>And, of course, GiveWell top charities have $500K to $23.4M in room for more funding            <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/04/03/top-charities-room-for-more-funding/\">according to the latest analysis</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>And other projects I\u2019m aware of are on the horizon and may make more public pitches soon.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>...Of course, it\u2019s possible you may not believe in supporting these projects. If so, depending on what you want to support, it\u2019s possible the remaining     room for more funding may be quite small. But the belief I\u2019ve been hearing from some that all EA projects are getting fully funded all the time and that EA     Ventures will simply take care of the rest is not currently true.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Earning_to_Give_May_Have_Better_Career_Capital\">Earning to Give May Have Better Career Capital</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/career-capital/\">Career capital</a>, as 80,000 Hours defines it, are the skills, credentials, connections, and other benefits you get from a career that help you have more impact in the     future. Since what matters is your total impact and not your current impact, it\u2019s quite plausible that young people (including myself) should be focusing     much more on career capital than having an impact now.</p>\n<p>Earning to give careers usually have good career capital opportunities. Usually the most important skills (80K suggests computer programming, web     development, statistics, machine learning, independent work, self-motivation, sales, communication, and management) are typically found in abundance in     good for-profit careers that also happen to have good earning to give potential.</p>\n<p>Yes, you can certainly find this capital in non-ETG careers, and I want to be careful to not fall into a charity vs. for-profit ETG dichotomy when many     additional options exist (e.g., research, academia, and politics). But I generally believe that it is easiest to find career capital within earning-to-give     careers and it becomes much easier to transition out of earning to give and into other careers than vice versa (with maybe the exception of academia).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2 id=\"_Earning_to_Give_Fits_More_People\"><strong> Earning to Give Fits More People</strong></h2>\n<p>Furthermore, psychologically, earning-to-give seems to me to be a better fit for the average EA than direct work. Many EAs are already working in a company     and can simply move to donate more of their salary or focus on increasing their salary, rather than quit their job and start a new one. Furthermore, EA     direct work is frequently concentrated in certain cities that require relocation, which can be a big choice.</p>\n<p>Another advantage to earning to give is it\u2019s often easier to accomplish for people who have less altruistic motivation or direct work talent. Of course,     this certainly misses 80K\u2019s point because they were talking about people on the margin and people who were high-talent and high-motivation who were open to     many career paths. That is a different question. But in the actual movement, it\u2019s important to note that many people are not in the top 0.1% of drive and     talent. Yet they still have a valuable thing to contribute -- a share of their job through earning to give. It\u2019s often much easier to get, keep, and do an     earning-to-give job than it is to do EA direct work.</p>\n<p>Lastly, earning to give frequently gives much more career capital than other jobs early on in one\u2019s career, which would allow for people to launch more     successful non-ETG careers in the future. It\u2019s generally a lot easier to move from earning to give to not earning than vice versa, given constraints on     personal savings and on various industries.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Obviously the choice between earning to give or something else is a personal one that is sensitive to your personal skills and fit. But I think if you have     the ability to enter a particularly high-earning career, there are good reasons to do so, and more people should be considering it than the current wisdom seems to     suggest.</p>\n<p>There are certainly good reasons to think 80K\u2019s argument is correct -- there is already a lot of money in EA through Good Ventures and other high net-worth     individuals and there is a potential that existing earning-to-give EAs may start donating much more soon. I\u2019m excited how much the EA movement might grow     through more direct work. However, I think we are still a ways off until earning-to-give people start reliably funding the remaining 85% of the movement.</p>\n<p>But until things change, I\u2019d suggest that 15% seems to me to be quite small, and I\u2019d suggest an earning-to-give ratio at 50% or even as high as 80% for the     movement as a whole.</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "28th Oct 2015", "title": "Why the Open Philanthropy Project isn't currently funding organizations focused on promoting effective altruism", "author": "HoldenKarnofsky", "num_comments": "5 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>This post attempts to clear up some confusions and discuss why\u00a0the Open Philanthropy Project isn't currently funding organizations focused on promoting effective altruism. \"We\" refers to the Open Philanthropy Project.</em></p>\n<p>We're excited about effective altruism, and we think of GiveWell as an effective altruist organization (while knowing that this term is subject to multiple interpretations, not all of which apply to us). <br><br> Over the last few years, multiple organizations have sprung up that focus on promoting and supporting the general ideas associated with effective altruism, and there's a case to be made that the Open Philanthropy Project should be funding such organizations. We may do so in the future, but we haven't to date and don't plan to do so imminently.<br><br> We are particularly interested in clarifying our thinking, and pointing out some of the constraints and limitations we face, in order to make clear that <strong>our lack of funding in this area does <em>not</em> mean that we have negatively evaluated the giving opportunities. We encourage individual donors to support organizations in this area if and when they feel they have ample context and a strong case for doing so.</strong> <br><br> For brevity, we abbreviate \"grants to organizations focused on promoting and supporting the general ideas associated with effective altruism\" as \"EA organization grants\" for the remainder of this post. Despite the abbreviation, this term isn't meant to include all organizations that consider themselves \"EA organizations,\" and in particular doesn't include organizations that focus on global catastrophic risk reduction. <br><br> Summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We generally (though with some exceptions) avoid \"one-off\" giving opportunities. Instead, we focus on choosing <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/05/14/the-importance-of-committing-to-causes/\">focus areas</a>, building capacity appropriate to our focus areas, and making grants within focus areas. Therefore, the question of why we don't make EA organization grants mostly comes down to the question of why we haven't made EA organization grants one of our focus areas. <a href=\"#Sec1\">More</a></li>\n<li>We feel that EA organization grants would be a relatively intensive focus area, in terms of the staff capacity it would require. There are several reasons for this, including the number of people and organizations seeking funding, the profile we would need for a staff member to focus in this area, and some risks of working in this space. We have tried thinking of ways to enter this area without using major staff capacity on it, but by default, we would have to sacrifice major parts of our current agenda to work in this area. <a href=\"#Sec2\">More</a> </li>\n<li>We think that other work is a better fit for our comparative advantage and long-term strategy. We feel that there are other donors well-positioned to fund EA organizations, while we are uniquely well-suited to apply effective altruist values in areas that are less explicitly \"about\" effective altruism. <a href=\"#Sec3\">More</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are several reasons for which we might make exceptions (one-off grants) or change our minds about EA organization grants as a focus area:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We would make any EA organization grant that seemed clearly outstanding, enough to offset all of the concerns listed here.</li>\n<li>We expect changes in the future on a couple of important fronts: our capacity and stage of development, and the degree of funding opportunities for EA organization grants. At some point, we expect to put more time into considering an EA organization grants program area; this would include engaging more deeply with questions we haven't yet thought hard about, such as how this area scores on our criteria of importance and tractability. </li>\n<li> We've also discussed some possible ways of funding EA organizations that would be less staff-intensive than our default \"focus area\" approach, and may find a way to make one of these work for us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bottom line is that at this point in time, we should be seen as generally agnostic on EA organization grants. It is true that we would put more time into this area if we had seen giving opportunities that seemed overwhelmingly compelling and unlikely to be funded by other donors, but for the most part we have not put enough time into assessing potential EA organization grants to have strong views. We don't think working on such grants is the right decision for our organization today, but we think there are other people for whom EA organization grants may be an excellent choice. While we sometimes share informal thoughts on effective altruism organizations and alert interested donors to giving opportunities, we feel that for the most part, many other donors are well-positioned to make their own judgments about whether to fund effective altruism organizations, particularly those donors who are highly impact-focused and have a good deal of context on the effective altruism community. <br><br> <a></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"Avoiding__one_off__grants\">Avoiding \"one-off\" grants</h2>\n<p>We have limited capacity, and we generally feel that one way to make the most of it is to concentrate on <em>focus areas</em>. \"Focus areas\" refers to <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/30/refining-the-goals-of-givewell-labs/\">causes</a> that we've made a deliberate, strategic decision to prioritize. <br><br> For any given focus area, we can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure there's one staffer responsible for being <em>highly</em> engaged in the area, meaning they know the relevant community, know the relevant literature, know some of the pitfalls to watch out for, know who the other funders are and how to avoid being fungible with them, and have a generally strong sense of context.</li>\n<li>Make sure that multiple people - particularly those who need to weigh in on grants - are <em>reasonably</em> up to speed on the area.</li>\n<li>Clearly lay out our priorities in the area, so that people can have a sense of what sorts of giving opportunities we are and aren't interested in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a giving opportunity sits within a focus area, we're generally able to evaluate it efficiently. It's clear whose role it is to provide most of the context; there are multiple people on staff who are familiar enough with the area to weigh in; potential risks are relatively easy to identify. We are well-positioned to explain our thinking to staff, to others in our audience, and to people who work within the cause. By contrast, one-off grants incur many of the costs of analyzing and discussing a new cause, without commensurate benefits. <br><br> In the specific case of EA organization grants, some of the costs of one-off grants are muted, while others are heightened. On one hand, we have strong connections in the effective altruist community, and we're broadly familiar with the goals of EA organizations, though we don't have the level of context we'd want for a focus area. So some of the costs associated with investigating focus areas are lower. On the other hand, we're particularly sensitive about problems we could cause if we funded some groups but not others, without being systematic and thoughtful about the reasons for doing so. Doing this could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send confusing signals. Grants might be interpreted as endorsements, and the lack of a grant might be interpreted as a negative evaluation - more than is warranted if we were making grants on a one-off basis without an overall strategy for the cause. Donors in this area also seem particularly inclined to put weight on our recommendations. Trying to signal accurately to other funders in the community would likely become a major undertaking, much more so than it is under the status quo.</li>\n<li>Distort our relationships with people in the effective altruism community. If our choices were perceived as largely arbitrary, opaque, and instinctive (as they would likely appear if we made one-off grants rather than systematically thinking through all our options in the cause), people seeking funding might cease to become honest peers and move in the direction of trying to figure out how to relate to us in order to get funding. This risk exists to some degree in any case, but I think it would be greatly magnified if people had the sense they could get funding from us while not having much idea of how.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>People in the effective altruism community are among those best positioned to both promote our work and to critique it at a big-picture level. Our relationships in this community are important to us, and that means we'd want to be able to situate any grants within this community in a well-thought-out overall strategy. <br><br> We aren't categorically opposed to one-off grants. We can make them when they appear sufficiently (a) outstanding and/or (b) unlikely to distract significantly from our focus-area-oriented work. EA organization grants generally seem particularly unlikely to pass the second criterion. <br><br> We have made <a href=\"http://www.goodventures.org/our-portfolio/grants/effective-altruists-of-berkeley-decal-university-course\">one small grant</a> in this category as a one-off, and may do so again in the future, but don't plan on much of it. <br><br> <a></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"EA_organization_grants_would_be_a_relatively_intensive_focus_area\">EA organization grants would be a relatively intensive focus area</h2>\n<p><br><br> There are some cases in which a focus area takes only a small fraction of a staff member's time - for example, <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/land-use-reform\">land use reform</a> and <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/labor-mobility\">immigration policy</a>. These causes are characterized by: (a) a thin field and ecosystem around our goals, with only a small number of giving opportunities and little in the way of established players; (b) sitting within a broader category (US policy) that one of our staff members focuses on. <br><br> By default, we don't think it would work well to approach EA organization grants this way, for several reasons. <br><br> First, there are enough organizations and people seeking funding that it would take serious time investment to keep up with and consider giving opportunities. <br><br> Second, there are some risks associated with this area:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Potential conflicts of interest.</strong> To some people, \"promoting effective altruism\" has a lot of overlap with \"encouraging people to use recommendations put out by GiveWell and the Open Philanthropy Project.\" To others, it has much less. By default, we naturally have more in common with people who want to heavily promote GiveWell (and the Open Philanthropy Project) than with people who do not. If we funded EA organization grants, this fact would probably mean we were more likely (all else equal) to support effective altruism organizations that saw promoting our work as an important part of their mission. At the same time, we would also have a <em>direct incentive</em> pushing us in the same direction: regardless of whether supporting highly pro-GiveWell organizations was good for the world, it would be good for us as an organization. This would be a tricky dynamic: we'd have to work hard to distinguish \"doing what's best for the world\" from \"doing what's most likely to get GiveWell promoted,\" even though we'd naturally perceive a high correlation between the two. We would risk distorting the effective altruism space in a pro-GiveWell direction, or being perceived as doing so. At the same time, our interest in the space as a whole might appear to people outside the effective altruism community as being primarily about promoting ourselves. </li>\n<li><strong>Managing high-stakes relationships.</strong> We see the effective altruist community as a significant source of useful feedback as well as potential staff, and many of our current staff have strong social ties to the community. We would feel the need to thoughtfully engage in any conflict and debate we might cause with our funding strategy, a fact that raises the importance of being thoughtful and systematic about our choices. </li>\n<li><strong>Risks of amplifying harmful messages.</strong> A fair amount of work has gone into defining and promoting the label \"effective altruism,\" and our organization is partly associated with this label. At the same time, effective altruism is still in a very nascent phase, there are several messages associated with it that we're not comfortable with, and amplification of problematic messages at this stage could affect general perceptions around the label, which could be a problem for both effective altruism and us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br> It's important to note that <strong>the above factors aren't arguments against working on EA organization grants; they're simply reasons that doing so would have to be fairly intensive for us.</strong> Many focus areas bring substantial challenges and would require significant effort to work in, and we are happy to take these challenges on for the small number of focus areas we prioritize most highly. <br><br> A final note on this topic is that there is a fairly small set of people whom we could picture leading our work on EA organization grants, and all of them could work on many other areas for us as well. We have done several <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/about/jobs/open-philanthropy-project\">cause-specific job searches</a>, looking for people we wouldn't find through our generalist hiring process, but we don't think this would work well for EA organization grants. <br><br> The bottom line of this section is that the opportunity cost of working on EA organization grants would be fairly high for us. It would likely require substantial time from generalist senior staff, which - at this stage in our development - would substantially slow our work on another broad category, such as scientific research funding. <br><br> We are actively thinking about ways we could approach EA organization grants in a less intensive way. We haven't yet settled on an approach we're comfortable with. <br><br> <a></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"Our_comparative_advantage\">Our comparative advantage</h2>\n<p><br><br> There are several reasons we prefer our current research agenda to one with more focus on EA organization grants. One is our informal assessment of the importance, neglectedness and tractability of the \"EA organization grants\" area. While we think greater interest in effective altruism could lead to a large amount of positive impact, the giving opportunities we've seen (after accounting for existing sources of funding) don't seem outstanding enough to make working in this area preferable to exploring other areas. However, this assessment is highly speculative and informal - especially given how far we are from having a good understanding of some of the areas we're working on, such as scientific research. <br><br> A different line of reasoning (that overlaps to some degree with questions around importance, neglectedness and tractability) has to do with our comparative advantage and long-term strategy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We feel that there are other donors well-positioned to fund EA organizations. </li>\n<li>We feel that we are uniquely well-suited to apply effective altruist values in areas that are less explicitly \"about\" effective altruism, and doing so could have significant benefits for our long-term strategy and for the effective altruism community.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Other_donors_are_well_positioned_to_fund_EA_organizations\">Other donors are well-positioned to fund EA organizations</h3>\n<p>It currently seems to us that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most effective altruist organizations have raised reasonable amounts of money relative to their stages of development. They have also generally hit their funding targets, though this data point should be interpreted very cautiously (funding targets are often set based on what's achievable).</li>\n<li>There are a number of people who (a) donate significant amounts; (b) are interested in EA organization grants; (c) are sufficiently connected in the effective altruism community to have strong context for evaluating potential EA organization grants; (d) do support much of the work in this space. In many cases, these people spend substantial time with the organizations they support and get to know their plans and leadership very well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This isn't to say that we've seen no funding gaps. But the field as a whole seems both relatively young (hence limited room for more funding) and capable of raising money in line with its current stage of development. And we're unsure of how much value we'd add over existing donors. The most unique aspects of the Open Philanthropy Project approach to funding pertain to cause selection; our model for working within a cause is not (so far) very different from the approach many others take, which is to assign most of the decision-making to a person who knows the space (and its organizations, people and literature) well and can make informed judgment calls. <br><br> As a more minor point, if we made a large commitment to the space of EA organization grants, we'd be somewhat worried about causing others to give less to EA organizations. The donors we're discussing tend to be highly attentive to questions like \"If I didn't fund this project, would someone else?\" - but we're not confident in all cases that we would agree with the details of how they handle these questions. If we made EA organization grants a focus area, and others gave less to EA organizations in hope that we would fill the gap, effective altruism organizations could end up with less robust donor bases, i.e. relying more heavily on fewer donors, and therefore in a weaker position.<br><br> It does seem worth noting that today's donors, by supporting EA organizations at their current level, may be helping build capacity that will lead to much larger giving opportunities down the line, and thus making our future entry into the space more likely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Our_comparative_advantage_and_long_term_strategy\">Our comparative advantage and long-term strategy</h3>\n<p><br> We feel that there are multiple individual donors who have similar values to ours and are well-positioned to evaluate EA organizations. By contrast, we feel that it is very challenging for individuals to apply effective altruist values to causes that aren't \"about\" effective altruism, and this is an area where we feel uniquely well-positioned to be helpful. <br><br> We've long believed that one of the best things we can do for effective altruism is to give it <em>more substance and definition</em>. There are other groups who focus on getting more people to become interested in the broad ideas and values behind effective altruism; by contrast, we feel particularly well-positioned to help people identify specific donations they can make, issues they can engage with, etc. once they have bought in. Doing this can, itself, help get more people interested in effective altruism. For example, we believe that GiveWell's work on <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">top charities</a> has improved engagement from people who wouldn't have been drawn in purely by the abstract idea of effective giving. Much as one might develop and refine a scientific theory by using it to make predictions, we're trying to develop and refine an effective altruist framework by using it to arrive at concrete recommendations. We believe that doing so can help improve and make the case for the framework, and that this is a distinct goal from supporting <em>promotion</em> of the framework. <br><br> There are a few other reasons that working on causes other than EA organization grants fits well with our long-term strategy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In general, we aim to focus our efforts toward a long-term goal of moving very large amounts of money. In some cases, we work in causes where we see imminent potential to make tens of millions of dollars per year in grants (for example, <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/criminal-justice-reform\">criminal justice reform</a> and <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/biosecurity\">biosecurity</a>). In other cases, we make small grants in a small field in the hopes that the field will grow and eventually have this sort of room for more funding. When it comes to EA organization grants, we feel that the field doesn't yet have room for a lot more funding, and that a reasonable amount of field-building is already going on without our funding. </li>\n<li>When the time comes that we have capacity for working on EA organization grants, we feel we will be able to do so relatively quickly, without needing the extended period of refining frameworks and building staff capacity that we need for other areas. By contrast, working on our current agenda means building capacity and knowledge for working in areas we couldn't otherwise explore. By prioritizing our current agenda, we believe we'll later be able to do more than if we were currently prioritizing EA organization grants. </li>\n<li>Over the long run, we hope to gain a reputation as a valuable resource for philanthropists, and thus to influence many future philanthropists. We think the areas we're exploring - which are highly likely to be of interest to future philanthropists, and which we currently have limited understanding of - will do more for this goal than making EA organization grants. </li>\n<li>We have somewhat of a general preference for avoiding cross-cutting, \"meta\" causes that we feel we'll be better positioned to work on later. For example, we may be more interested in \"improving democracy\" work after we've gained a better sense of the major issues and challenges in US policy, which can help us ensure that any \"improving democracy\" work we do focuses on the issues we see as most crucial. There is an analogous preference regarding effective altruism: we feel that we will be better-positioned to see the potential value-added of effective altruism after we can say more about what causes we think are most in need of more attention, and thus how additional effective altruists can add the most value. This is a relatively minor factor, but seems worth noting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"Bottom_line\">Bottom line</h2>\n<p>At the moment, we're not imminently planning to make EA organization grants, either as one-offs or via a focus area. We're continually reassessing this stance. Our staff capacity is in flux (generally growing), as is the state of the effective altruism community and the associated giving opportunities. As room for more funding in the EA organization grants space grows, and our capacity grows, the case for working on EA organization grants gets stronger. We do want to hear about EA grant giving opportunities; the more pressing and un-filled gaps we heard about, the more likely we would be to make the space a focus area, and we haven't ruled out one-off grants if the right opportunities (both in terms of promise and in terms of time required from us and potential risks) arose. <br><br> For the time being, however, we wish to make clear that we see no conflict between (a) choosing not to make EA organization grants ourselves and (b) being glad that there are other donors interested in doing so (both of which are the case).</p></div></div>"},

But we can avoid it.", "author": "Peter_Hurford", "num_comments": "66 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>If you think a typical EA cause has very high impact, it seems quite plausible that you can have even higher impact by working one level of \u201cmeta\u201d up -- working not on that cause directly, but instead working on <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/04/the-haste-consideration/\">getting more people to work on that cause</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, while the impact of a donation to the <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/\">Against Malaria Foundation</a><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/amf\">seems quite large</a>, it should be even more impactful to donate to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/organizational-breakdown.html\">Charity Science</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/GivingWhatWeCan-FundraisingProspectus2015.pdf\">Giving What We Can</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com\">The Life You Can Save</a>, or <a href=\"http://reg-charity.org/money-moved-q4-2014/\">Raising for Effective Giving</a>, all of which claim to be able to move many dollars to AMF for every dollar donated to them. Likewise, if you think an individual EA is quite valuable because of the impact they\u2019ll have, you may want to invest your time and money not in having a direct impact, but in producing more EAs!</p>\n<p>However, while I agree with this logic, I\u2019m nervous about going too far. <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9124145/effective-altruism-global-ai\">As Dylan Matthews says</a>, \u201cif you take meta-charity too far, you get a movement that's really good at expanding itself but not necessarily good at actually helping people\u201d. This is what leads to what Matthews called \u201c[d]oing good through aggressive self-promotion\u201d or what I\u2019m calling \u201cthe meta trap\u201d. While some meta-projects may have the highest impact in expectation, there are higher-order reasons to want to avoid giving all your resources to meta orgs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Meta_Trap__1__Meta_Orgs_Risk_Not_Actually_Having_an_Impact\">Meta Trap #1: Meta Orgs Risk Not Actually Having an Impact</h2>\n<p>Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.</p>\n<p>Which is more probable? (1) Linda is a bank teller or (2) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.</p>\n<p>When asked by Tversky and Khaneman, the majority of people picked #2. However, this isn\u2019t possible, since the probability of two events both occurring cannot be greater than the probability of one of those two events occurring.</p>\n<p>This is called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy\">conjuction fallacy</a>, and it is a classic bias of human rationality. However, it\u2019s also a classic bias of meta-charity.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>When you chain different probabilities together, every additional step in the chain will, in almost every case, weaken it. This is also true with chaining together steps of meta-charity together -- while you\u2019re getting higher returns in expected value, you\u2019re also reducing the chance the impact will actually occur.</p>\n<p>Consider someone who is considering donating to fund the salary of a staff member to work full-time finding volunteer mentors to advise new EA chapters at various universities. These EA chapters will in turn bring more college students into EA, and these new EAs will then graduate and will all earn-to-give for GiveWell top charities. (While a bit silly-sounding, this plan is so realistic in EA, I\u2019ve actually funded a form of it.)</p>\n<p>This plan could have quite a high impact. While donating to AMF all our lives is great, if we can spend our effort to get two people to donate to AMF instead of us, we\u2019ve doubled our impact. If we can spend our effort creating an entire college group to get dozens of people to donate AMF, so much more impact! And then we can expand an entire network of college groups! And then we can become even more efficient in expanding this network. So much impact!</p>\n<p>However, we\u2019ve also now constructed a meta-chain that is five steps removed from the actual impact. There\u2019s a lot that can now go wrong in this chain -- the chapters could get set up successfully but fail to get enough people to donate, the chapters could fail to get set up at all due to problems unrelated to the mentoring, the mentors themselves could fail to be better than if the full-time staff member just advised full-time instead, and the staff member could end up being really bad at recruiting volunteer mentors.</p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t mean the chapter chain doesn\u2019t have high expected value or that it\u2019s not worth doing. It just means that it\u2019s risky, and I\u2019m nervous that as the levels of meta scale up, the additional risk taken on by introducing ways to break the chain might be much greater than the additional leverage taken by introducing another meta step.</p>\n<p>I do think meta-charities are worth pursuing and <a href=\"http://peterhurford.com/other/donations.html\">I fund them myself</a>. But for every time I think about how good of an opportunity the connections facilitated at EA Global are, I also worry about whether the new EAs brought into the movement really are going to create more counterfactual impact than the considerable cost of the conference.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Meta_Trap__2__Meta_Orgs_Risk_Curling_In_On_Themselves\">Meta Trap #2: Meta Orgs Risk Curling In On Themselves</h2>\n<p>When I was in college, I once joked about a fictitious club called \u201cClub Club\u201d with the only purpose of perpetuating the club. Every Club Club meeting would be about how to advertise Club Club, how to recruit more Club Club members, and how to better retain the members that Club Club already had. Club Club wouldn\u2019t actually do anything. On days where I\u2019m especially grumpy, I worry that EA may become that.</p>\n<p>The problem is that if we spread the idea that meta-orgs are the highest impact opportunity too well, we risk the creation of a meta-movement to spread the meta-movement and nothing else. Once meta-orgs get to the point where it\u2019s all about EAs helping other EAs to help EAs, we\u2019ve gotten to the point where there\u2019s serious risk that actual impact won\u2019t occur.</p>\n<p>Consider that plan again where we get someone to full-time find chapter advisors for setting up lots of EA chapters. Now imagine that instead of advocating to the college students that they earn to give for GiveWell charities we suggest that this chapter building project is really the best possible thing to be doing, so they should get involved in, donate to, and volunteer for it. Now we\u2019ve got chapters developing chapters to perpetuate developing more chapters. But what does this actually accomplish? We might as well have them working to set up Club Club.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Meta_Trap__3__You_Can_t_Use_Meta_as_an_Excuse_for_Cause_Indecisiveness\">Meta Trap #3: You Can\u2019t Use Meta as an Excuse for Cause Indecisiveness</h2>\n<p>EA is made up of quite a few different object-level causes and it can be hard to figure out which one is the best. Is it global poverty? Existential risk reduction? Animal welfare? Or something else?</p>\n<p>Somehow, meta-work became it\u2019s own cause in this list, but I think that\u2019s a mistake. Meta-work isn\u2019t a cause, it\u2019s a meta-cause, and it\u2019s supposed to make the above actual-causes go better. To understand the meta-impact that meta-work has, it\u2019s important to understand the object-level causes and have opinions on which one is best.</p>\n<p>However, I feel like far too often people (including myself) hide behind donations to meta-charity as a feel-good way to support the EA movement as a whole without doing the hard work of figuring out which object-level causes are the best. Unless you\u2019re funding cause prioritization research or hoping to bring in EAs who will shed more light on the question of which cause is the best, this seems like a big risk. It avoids learning opportunities and discussions we could be having about what the best causes actually are, which also pushes the entire movement forward.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Meta_Trap__4__At_Some_Point__You_Have_to_Stop_Being_Meta\">Meta Trap #4: At Some Point, You Have to Stop Being Meta</h2>\n<p>Abraham Lincoln is <a href=\"http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/03/29/sharp-axe/\">purported to</a> have said \u201cGive me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.\u201d I think this is generally a good philosophy to follow. But at some point you have to swing the axe and actually chop down the tree. If you have six hours to chop down the tree and you spend all six hours sharpening the axe, you\u2019re obviously doing it wrong.</p>\n<p>The problem we face with meta tasks is that we don\u2019t really know how much time we have, and we have to allocate this unknown amount of time to axe sharpening (meta-work) and tree chopping (actual impact). At what point should we start chopping? I\u2019m nervous that we may get so carried away with meta-work we forget to actually chop at some point.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Meta_Trap__5__Sometimes__Well_Executed_Object_Level_Action_is_What_Best_Grows_the_Movement\">Meta Trap #5: Sometimes, Well Executed Object-Level Action is What Best Grows the Movement</h2>\n<p>GiveWell is considered a meta-org, but they focus on direct research about which cause is best. Historically, <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/04/02/our-work-on-outreach/\">they have not focused much resources on outreach or marketing</a>. Instead, they just focused on doing a very good job on their research and delivering high-quality recommendations. In turn, they attracted many donors, including a big foundation. As GiveWell says, \u201cMuch of our most valuable publicity and promotion has come from enthusiastic people who actively sought us out\u201d and that they \u201chave generally felt that improving the quality of [their] research, and [the] existing audience\u2019s understanding of it, has been the most important factor in [their] growth\u201d.</p>\n<p>Perhaps counter-intuitively, doing really well on object-level stuff could also be one of the best things we can do to grow a quality movement. People aren\u2019t attracted to marketing, they're attracted to people doing a good job. Marketing is only useful in so far as it draws attention to good work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"How_Can_We_Defuse_The_Meta_Trap__\">How Can We Defuse The Meta Trap?\u00a0</h2>\n<p>To be clear, I don\u2019t think the EA movement is in a meta trap yet. I think we\u2019re doing good work and making a lot of progress on important, object-level issues. But I want to be careful. I think the meta trap is a real problem.</p>\n<p>Here are two steps I think would work to defuse it:</p>\n<p><strong> 1.) The more steps away from impact an EA plan is, the more additional scrutiny it should get.</strong> The idea of a meta-meta-org may sound unusual, but many EA plans are actually that. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re wrongheaded -- I just think they warrant extra skepticism. Are we really getting extra impact from each step? Or are we just introducing a lot of risk by bringing in another chain that might collapse the whole thing?</p>\n<p><strong> 2.) More EAs should have a substantial stake in object-level impact.</strong> Right now I\u2019m aiming at donating 50% of my pool to the best meta-projects I know and spending the other 50% on direct impact through GiveWell\u2019s top charities. I don\u2019t know if 50% is the correct number, but I hope this will set an example of what I want the movement as a whole to do.</p>\n<p>I think <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/why-global-poverty\">Jeff Kaufman at EA Global put it best</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So yes, we should do this, we should put substantial effort into growing the movement. But this isn't the only thing we should do. We can't have an entirely meta movement that goes grow, grow, grow, build growth capacity, bring in people to bring in people, bigger and bigger, and then shift focus? Turn your giant optimized-for-growth movement into an optimized-for-helping one? Not going to work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We need to do things that help people alongside growing the movement, and personally I try to divide my efforts 50-50. As I argued above, for the doing-good-now portion I think global poverty is our best shot. This isn't settled\u2014EA is all about being open to the best options for helping others, whatever those causes happen to be\u2014but today I think the best you can do to help people now is donate to <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell's top charities</a>.\u201c</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>-</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>Since I wrote this post, more discussion has occurred: <a href=\"/ea/o4/why_we_need_more_meta/\">Ben Todd has written a reply</a> and <a href=\"/ea/154/thoughts_on_the_meta_trap/\">Rohin has expanded upon my work to add three additional traps</a>.

However, we put the most significant weight upon a </span><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/10/15/charities-wed-like-to-see/\"><span>recent GiveWell blog post</span></a><span> which calls for high quality charities to work on a number of priority interventions and strongly suggests that they think this is a high impact thing to do. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>The evidence exists to identify a cost-effective intervention </span></p>\n<p><span>Randomized control trials by </span><a href=\"http://www.poverty-action.org/\"><span>IPA</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"http://www.povertyactionlab.org/\"><span>J-PAL</span></a><span>, the transparent and rigorous research by GiveWell, and the systematic evaluation by the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_Control_Priorities_Project\"><span>Disease Control Priorities Project</span></a><span> have significantly contributed to an existent evidence base that allows for the identification of a number of cost-effective interventions. It seems likely that communication with knowledgeable people will help fine tune proposed interventions and groups exist to partner with in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed interventions. </span><a href=\"http://www.gapminder.org/\"><span>Gapminder</span></a><span> complements these resources by allowing for the analysis of macro trends. We put the most significant weight upon GiveWell\u2019s identification of </span><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs\"><span>a number of priority programs</span></a><span> where an evidence-based, cost-effective charity could exist and feel that this list makes for an excellent place to begin research from. With these available resources it seems likely a group could identify an evidence-based, cost-effective intervention. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>The charity market doesn\u2019t efficiently capitalise on evidence based cost effective interventions.</span></p>\n<p><span>Very few charities are started to be high impact and evidence-based, with </span><a href=\"http://evidenceaction.org/\"><span>Evidence Action\u2019s</span></a><span> method being a notable exception. Even some of GiveWell\u2019s top charities weren\u2019t started to be highly effective but rather as a result of circumstances came upon what was a cost-effective intervention. Most charities are instead founded off exciting ideas or pet theories rather than a search of the scientific literature and understanding of what experts think a high impact charity is. Moreover, few people with utilitarian values and an empirical epistemology have founded a charity. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>This notion is heavily supported by GiveWell\u2019s identification of multiple priority programs which don\u2019t have a promising charity that focuses on them. This includes cases where charities working on priority programs don\u2019t have satisfactory evidence for their track record or are hesitant to share information. GiveWell also notes that they would be excited to see more charities attempt bednet distribution, deworming programs and cash transfers. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>That so few charities are attempting these evidence-based, cost-effective interventions makes us think that the </span><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/\"><span>existing charity market is far from efficient.</span></a><span> Luke Muehlhauser </span><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/ie7/how_efficient_is_the_charitable_market/\"><span>notes</span></a><span> this might be because most people don\u2019t seem to care what their donations achieve and that it\u2019s difficult to know what a donation does achieve. </span><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/10/obstacles-to-giving-as-consumption/\"><span>Elsewhere</span></a><span>, GiveWell mentions other factors contributing to this, including that most charities </span><span>don\u2019t focus on directly delivering a small number of programs, it\u2019s rare to rigorously evaluate the outcomes of programs and the prevailing culture is one in which criticism is frowned upon and a lack of transparency is the norm. The resulting inefficiencies within the charitable market suggest the counterfactual of an evidence-based, cost-effective charity would be a significant period of time where no group acted in a similar manner. It also suggests that there may be low hanging fruit in the area of evidence-based, cost-effective charities. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>There are sufficient structures in place to research, pilot, test and scale a new evidence-based, cost-effective charity.</span></p>\n<p><span>Significant </span><a href=\"/ea/ib/request_for_feedback_researching_global_poverty/\"><span>interest expressed in this subject</span></a><span> within the EA community, private conversations with others in the EA community, the possible use of an </span><a href=\"http://eagrow.herokuapp.com/\"><span>EA incubator</span></a><span> and possible funding from </span><a href=\"http://www.eaventures.org/\"><span>EA Ventures</span></a><span> makes us feel it likely that adequate support exists for this project in its earliest stages. </span><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/03/05/2015-plan-for-givewells-traditional-top-charities-work/#experimentalwork\"><span>GiveWell\u2019s interest</span></a><span> and possible funding from the Open Philanthropy Project, </span><a href=\"http://www.goodventures.org/\"><span>Good Ventures</span></a><span>, the </span><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/blog/the-only-gif-that-improves-the-world\"><span>Global Innovation Fund</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"http://www.evidenceaction.org/#about\"><span>Evidence Action</span></a><span>, the </span><a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/\"><span>Gates Foundation</span></a><span> and the </span><a href=\"https://ciff.org/\"><span>Children\u2019s Investment Fund Foundation</span></a><span> makes us feel it likely that this project will receive adequate funding in its early and middle stages. In addition to the previously mentioned sources, the possibility of partnering with IPA or J-PAL makes us feel it likely that there exists adequate support for the testing stage of this project. Lastly in combination with previously mentioned funding sources, the possibility of becoming recommended by GiveWell, </span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\"><span>Giving What We Can</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\"><span>The Life You Can Save</span></a><span> and Charity Science makes us feel that there will be adequate funding for this project in the scaling phase. With all these available resources it seems likely that an evidence-based, cost-effective charity could achieve a large scale.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Evidence that a lack of room for more funds may be a problem within existing GiveWell top charities.</span></p>\n<p><span>In 2013 GiveWell </span><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/26/change-in-against-malaria-foundation-recommendation-status-room-for-more-funding-related/\"><span>removed the Against Malaria Foundation as a top charity</span></a><span> because it lacked room for more funding. With the funding capacity of Good Ventures this could happen with other top charities, particularly given </span><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/08/03/good-ventures-25-million-grant-to-givedirectly/\"><span>Good Ventures\u2019 $25 million grant to GiveDirectly</span></a><span> earlier this year. This is compounded by the growing size of the effective altruist movement. In this context a new charity able to absorb a large amount of funding could be very beneficial.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>A new evidence-based, cost-effective charity could bring effective giving to more people and institutions. </span></p>\n<p><span>In conversation GiveWell conveyed that another top charity could result in more dollars moved to top charities overall and this was justified by it being the case for GiveDirectly. Interestingly GiveDirectly\u2019s intervention of unconditional cash transfers may in future be used as a standard comparison in the randomized control trials of poverty interventions conducted by IPA and J-PAL. This could spread effective giving and similarly sized flow through effects may exist for identifying and executing another evidence-based, cost-effective intervention. It also seems reasonable to suggest that people who fundraise for effective giving would be aided by an additional top charity as a greater variety of charities to fundraise for may allow for catering to more preferences. GiveWell may also receive slightly more media coverage as a result of the addition of a new top charity. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Some Charity Science staff and board members feel like they are well suited act on the above considerations.</span></p>\n<p><span>Some Charity Science staff and board members feel charity </span><span>entrepreneurship is a good personal fit for their personalities, interests and abilities. We are willing to stop working on projects that appear ineffective, we have low living costs, are familiar with GiveWell content and are part of a network capable of funding this project. As EAs we will take into account considerations others won\u2019t, will be transparent and possess relevant experience from our involvement with and founding of Charity Science. We also feel it\u2019s possible that as a team we could engage in serial entrepreneurship and be involved in starting several useful organizations. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>The reasoning outlined in this post forms a significant part of why some of the Charity Science staff and board members will pursue founding an evidence-based, cost-effective charity, aiming for it to become GiveWell recommended. In future, we plan to write more on our methodology, crucial considerations and promising interventions. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Further Reading</span></p>\n<p><span>GiveWell Blog: </span><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/10/15/charities-wed-like-to-see/\"><span>Charities we\u2019d like to see</span></a></p>\n<p><span>Effective Altruism Forum: </span><a href=\"/ea/ib/request_for_feedback_researching_global_poverty/\"><span>Request for Feedback: Researching global poverty interventions with the intention of founding a charity.</span></a></p>\n<p><em>Contact</em></p>\n<p>Please direct private communications regarding this project to savoiejoey@gmail.com</p></div></div>"},

We all have friends who support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>A wide range of different cause areas.<br> </span></li>\n<li><span>A wide range of different approaches to those causes.<br> </span></li>\n<li><span>Different values and moral philosophies regarding what it means to 'help others'.<br> </span></li>\n<li><span>Different political views on how best to achieve even shared goals. On economic policy for example, we have people covering the full range from far left to far right. In the CEA offices we have voters for every major political party, and some smaller ones too.<br> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Looking beyond just stated beliefs, we also have people with a wide range of temperaments, from highly argumentative, confident and outspoken to cautious, idiosyncratic and humble.</span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Our_wide_range_of_views_could_cause_problems\">Our wide range of views could cause problems</strong></p>\n<p>There is a popular saying that 'opposites attract'. But unfortunately, social scientists have found precisely the opposite to be true: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophily\"><span>birds of a feather do in fact flock together</span></a>.</p>\n<p>One of the drivers of this phenomenon is that people who are different are more likely to get into conflicts with one another. If my partner and I liked to keep the house exactly the same way, we certainly wouldn't have as many arguments about cleaning (I'll leave you to speculate about who is the untidy one!). People who are different from you may initially strike you as merely amusing, peculiar or mistaken, but when you talk to them at length and they don't see reason, you may start to see them as stupid, biased, rude, impossible to deal with, unkind, and perhaps even outright bad people.</p>\n<p>A movement brought together by a shared interest in the question <em>\u2018what should we do?\u2019</em> will inevitably have a greater diversity of priorities, and justifications for those priorities, than a movement united by a shared answer. This is in many ways our core strength. Maintaining a diversity of views means we are less likely to get permanently stuck on the wrong track, because we can learn from one another's scholarship and experiences, and correct course if necessary.</p>\n<p>However, it also means we are necessarily committed to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralism_%28political_philosophy%29\"><span>ideological pluralism</span></a>. While it is possible to maintain \u2018Big Tent\u2019 social movements they face some challenges. The more people hold opinions that others dislike, the more possible points of friction there are that can cause us to form negative opinions of one another. There have already been strongly worded exchanges online demonstrating the risk.</p>\n<p>When a minority holds an unpopular view they can feel set upon and bullied, while the majority feels mystified and frustrated that a small group of people can't see the obvious truth that so many accept.</p>\n<p>My first goal with this post is to make us aware of this phenomenon, and offer my support for a culture of peaceful coexistence between people who, even after they share all their reasons and reflect, still disagree.</p>\n<p>My second goal is to offer a few specific actions that can help us avoid interpersonal conflicts that don't contribute to making the world a better place:</p>\n<p><strong id=\"1__Remember_that_you_might_be_wrong\">1. Remember that you might be wrong</strong></p>\n<p>Hard as it is to keep in mind when you're talking to someone who strongly disagrees with you, it is always possible that they have good points to make that would change your mind, at least a bit. Most claims are only <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anekantavada\"><span>\u2018partially true or false\u2019</span></a>, and there is almost always something valuable you can learn from someone who disagrees with you, even if it is just an understanding of how they think.</p>\n<p>If the other person seems generally as intelligent and informed about the topic as you, it's not even clear why you should give more weight to <a href=\"http://tar.weatherson.org/2010/04/04/what-is-the-equal-weight-view-of-disagreement/\"><span>your own opinion than theirs</span></a>.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"2__Be_polite__doubly_so_if_your_partner_is_not\">2. Be polite, doubly so if your partner is not</strong></p>\n<p>Being polite will make both the person you are talking to, and onlookers, more likely to come around to your view. It also means that you're less likely to get into a fight that will hurt others and absorb your precious time and emotional energy.</p>\n<p>Politeness has many components, some notable ones being: not criticising someone personally; interpreting their behaviour and statements in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity\"><span>fairly charitable way</span></a>; not being a show-off, or patronising and publicly embarrassing others; respecting others as your equals, even if you think they are not; conceding when they have made a good point; and finally keeping the conversation focussed on information that can be shared, confirmed, and might actually prove persuasive.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"3__Don_t_infer_bad_motivations\">3. Don't infer bad motivations</strong></p>\n<p>While humans often make mistakes in their thinking, it's uncommon for them to be straight out uninterested in the welfare of others or what is right, especially so in this movement. Even if they are, they are probably not aware that that is the case. And even if they are aware, you won't come across well to onlookers by addressing them as though they have bad motivations.</p>\n<p>If you really do become convinced the person you are talking to is speaking in bad faith, it's time to walk away. As they say: don't feed the trolls.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"4__Stay_cool\">4. Stay cool</strong></p>\n<p>Even when people say things that warrant anger and outrage, expressing anger or outrage publicly will rarely make the world a better place. Anger being understandable or natural is very different from it being useful, especially if the other person is likely to retaliate with anger of their own.</p>\n<p>Being angry does not improve the quality of your thinking, persuade others that you're right, make you happier or more productive, or make for a more harmonious community.</p>\n<p>In its defence, anger can be highly motivating. Unfortunately it is indiscriminate about motivating you to do very valuable, ineffective and even harmful things.</p>\n<p>Any technique that can keep you calm is therefore useful. If something is making you unavoidably angry, it's typically best to walk away and let other people deal with it.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"5__Pick_your_battles\">5. Pick your battles</strong></p>\n<p>Not all things are equally important to reach a consensus about. For good or ill, most things we spend our days talking about just aren't that 'action relevant'. If you find yourself edging towards interpersonal conflict on a question that i) isn't going to change anyone's actions much; ii) isn't going to make the world a much better place, even if it does change their actions; or iii) is very hard to persuade others about, maybe it isn't <span>worth the cost</span> of interpersonal tension to explore in detail.</p>\n<p>So if someone in the community says something unrelated or peripheral to effective altruism that you disagree with, which could develop into a conflict, you always have the option of not taking the bait. In a week, you and they may not even remember it was mentioned, let alone consider it worth damaging your relationship over.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"6__Let_it_go\">6. Let it go</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The most important advice of all.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you <em>are</em> discussing something important. Perhaps you've made great arguments. Perhaps everyone you know agrees with you. You've been polite, and charitable, and kept your cool. But the person you're talking to still holds a view you strongly disagree with and believe is harmful.</p>\n<p>If that's the case, it's probably time for you both to walk away before your opinions of one another fall too far, or the disagreement spirals into sectarianism. If someone can't be persuaded, you can at least avoid creating an ill-will between you that ensures they never come around. You've done what you can for now, and that is enough.</p>\n<p>Hopefully time will show which of you is right, or space away from a public debate will give one of you the chance to change your mind in private without losing face. In the meantime maybe you can't work closely together, but you can at least remain friendly and respectful.</p>\n<p>It isn't likely or even desirable for us to end up agreeing with one another on everything. The world is a horribly complex place; if the questions we are asking had easy answers the research we are doing wouldn't be necessary in the first place.</p>\n<p>The cost of being part of a community that accepts and takes an interest in your views, even though many think you are pulling in the wrong direction, is to be tolerant of others in the same way even when you think their views are harmful.</p>\n<p>So, sometimes, you just have to <a href=\"http://youtu.be/moSFlvxnbgk?t=60s\"><span>let it go</span></a>.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><span><strong>PS</strong></span></p>\n<p>If you agree with me about the above, you might be tempted to post or send it to people every time they aren\u2019t playing by these rules. Unfortunately, this is likely to be counterproductive and lead to more conflict rather than less. It\u2019s useful to share this post in general, but not trot it out as a way of policing others. The most effective way to promote this style of interaction is to exemplify it in the way you treat others, and not get into long conversations with people who have less productive ways of talking to others.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Amanda, Will, Diana, Michelle, Catriona, Marek, Niel, Tonja, Sam and George for feedback on drafts of this post.</em></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "11th Aug 2015", "title": "How we can make it easier to change your mind about cause areas", "author": "ClaireZabel", "num_comments": "15 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>TL:DR- Individual cause area re-prioritization is hard and may be getting harder. \u00a0It would be helpful to have a toolkit of techniques for making the process easier and better. \u00a0I highly recommend most of you give $20 to a charity in every major EA cause area, and also do some other things.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's hard, and possibly getting harder, for an individual EA to re-prioritize between causes. There are a few simple and practical measures we can use to make the cause selection go more smoothly and effectively. \u00a0Here are a few reasons I've seen (or think I've seen) a lot of evidence for recently in myself and other EAs.</p>\n<p>1) Sticking with one cause feels good/familiar, and unfamiliar other cause areas don't feel as good (maybe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect\">Mere-exposure effect</a> has gotten to you, or maybe you were always more comfortable with one for separate reasons).\u00a0</p>\n<p>2) You identify with a cause area or charity, and might lose that emotional connection if you donated* elsewhere (plus\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion\">loss aversion</a>\u00a0twice over: once for losing the particular connection, and again for losing some confidence that you can or should become attached to a given cause or charity). \u00a0This is one I struggle with a lot. \u00a0</p>\n<p>3) You fear you would lose status if you changed your mind, or that it would be socially difficult or costly to do so because of personal or professional relationships.</p>\n<p>4) You \"aren't the kind of person\" who donates to a certain cause area (I heard slight variations on this 5-ish times at EAG, e.g. \"I'm not a radical EA that gives to fringe causes\"). \u00a0You don't (just) identify with cause X, you identify with not-cause Y and Z. This makes me sad.</p>\n<p>5) You thought hard about this a while back, and have since cached the idea that you've done the mental work of cause selection satisfactorily. \u00a0You may not be aware that there were holes in your original reasoning, or that new evidence has come to light that affects your earlier conclusions.</p>\n<p>I expect all of these to grow more powerful over time. As our donation histories lengthen, we have more opportunities to identify more strongly with a certain charity or cause. More habituation takes place. Our community becomes more entrenched, and so we can expect more and stronger interpersonal relationships that make radical changes potentially costly. Reasoning that may have originally been sound is more likely to become outdated if it's not updated.</p>\n<p>It's well worth small amounts of effort to fight identity ossification of this sort early and often, if the efforts are effective. \u00a0<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/idj/use_your_identity_carefully/\">Identities are powerful</a>, and we should actively manage them. \u00a0I fear these processes will decrease cause selection quality. On the other hand, longer exposure to EA means greater exposure to information about other cause areas. Hopefully the second force is stronger. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Regardless, it would be helpful to have a toolkit of measures to push back against possible trends 1-5 without hurting the positive aspects of those trends, like stronger communities and more comfort with the process of giving.</p>\n<p>What can we do about this? I'm not sure, but here are a few things I've been experimenting with.</p>\n<p>Most simply:</p>\n<p>1) Give a small donation ($20) to a charity in each major cause area, <em>especially</em> the ones you've never donated to before. \u00a0This will help prevent strong identification as a not-donor to cause area X or as only a donor to cause area Y. \u00a0It may decrease the perceived foreignness of other cause areas than your current favorite. \u00a0</p>\n<p>But also:</p>\n<p>2) Try <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/gpl/imitation_is_the_sincerest_form_of_argument/\">Ideological Turing Tests</a> to check how well you understand the arguments for other courses of action.</p>\n<p>3) If you feel comfortable, make a habit of asking other EAs to explain how they picked their cause area, and invite them to try to convince you to change your mind, so they don't have to worry about being inappropriately aggressive towards people who don't want it.</p>\n<p>4) Then document and share these arguments so lots of people don't unwittingly reproduce the same work.</p>\n<p>5) De-stigmatize talking about emotional attachment to causes. \u00a0My strong impression is that many EAs have these attachments, but feel they have no place in the ideal EA conversation about cause selection, so they repress or subvert those feelings out of fear of looking irrational, or having their opinions be taken less seriously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What else would people recommend to make cause re-prioritization easier? How can we manage our personal relationships and local community dynamics so that they are strong and meaningful, but interfere as little as possible with our donating decisions?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*throughout, I use \"donating\" as a shorthand for any action, including volunteering, professional work, journalistic coverage, political advocacy, and more, that's in support of a given cause area.\u00a0</p></div></div>"},

For example, William MacAskill claimed to find out the identity of \u201cThe Best Person who Ever Lived\u201d is using this method<a href=\"#_ftn1\"><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[1]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-The distinction is obscured when EAs say ambiguous things like \u201c<em>It\u2019s better to become a banker and give away 10% of your income than to become a social worker</em>\u201d. The sentence could mean that becoming a banker produces better outcomes, or that a person who becomes a banker is more moral. The former claim is true but the latter depends on the banker\u2019s motivations and may be false. They may have wanted to go into banking anyway; and giving away 10% may only be a small sacrifice for them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-We can also confuse the two sides of the distinction when we think about our own moral aims. We want to do as much good as possible, and we evaluate the extent to which we succeed. However it\u2019s easy to confuse failure in achieving our moral aims with a failure to be a good person. This is a common confusion. For example the father who can\u2019t adequately feed his children, despite working as hard as he could, has done nothing wrong yet still feels very guilty.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-Some of the discourse within the movement appears to imply that those who do the most good are, because of this, the best people.

Then the EA movement will seem to be committed to the claim that EAs are, in general, significantly better people than non-EAs. But EAs often live comfortable lives with relatively low levels of personal sacrifice, so this is bound to make non-EAs angry.

But how did I end up here? Because of my race and gender people were more likely to see me as a potential engineer and take my efforts seriously. Because my parents could afford a computer in the 1980s there was one around for me to learn on. Because they could afford good schooling for me there were classes where I could practice this skill and study the theory behind it. It's hard to know the chain of causality that led to me getting into programming, but it's substantially less likely that I'd be here if I'd not had these advantages along the way.</p>\n<p>If you think of privilege as something you have that makes you a bad person, if you know the word and know it applies to you but you try to hide and dismiss your privilege, to find axes along which you have less of it, that's only marginally more helpful than if you were to deny your privilege entirely and insist that all your accomplishments in life have been due to your efforts alone. Having privilege puts you in position where you have an outsized ability to effect change. The best response to privilege is to turn it to fixing the situation that led you to having these major advantages over others.</p>\n<p>If I look at my situation, my race, class, and gender privilege have been helpful, but my nationality privilege is by far my biggest unearned advantage. Someone at the poverty line in the US earns more than 90% of people in the world, even after adjusting for money going farther in poorer countries. This is not to minimize the suffering of people in the US, along any dimension, but to illustrate the extent of the problem and the work required. With so much need, how could I possibly justify keeping my luck to myself?</p>\n<p>So I earn to give. I can't reject my privilege, I can't give it back, the best I can do is use it to give back.</p>\n<p><small><em>I also posted this <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/the-privilege-of-earning-to-give\">on my blog</a>.</em></small></p></div></div>"},

The first category of efforts are often ugly and counterproductive, and in other movements I've witnessed the debate itself scaring members of the targeted demographic away. Without rehashing the debate on the merits of diversity, given that a person has decided they want to increase movement diversity, here are some common failure modes I have witnessed:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>exaggerating the demographics to make your point, in a way that suggests that there are no members of the target demographic currently or at least none whose contributions are meaningful.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 useful ways of making this criticism: \u201cwe\u2019re 70% male. why is that?\u201d \"we want more people from developing countries.\" \u00a0\"the majority of EAs are just out of college.\"\u00a0</span><br><span>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ways of making this criticism which have frustrated me: \u201cwhy aren\u2019t women involved in this movement?\u201d \"EAs are from all over the world - well, if the only countries in \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the world are America, Britain, and Australia\" \"if EA wants to appeal to anyone who isn't an autistic white nerd...</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>suggesting that the movement needs members of the target demographic by appealing to sexist/racist/offensive stereotypes (\u201dwe\u2019re not warm and empathetic enough. that\u2019s why we need more women in the movement\u201d. \"the reason we don't have enough black people is because we're too intellectual and data-focused.\")</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>suggesting that the movement recruit by appealing to offensive stereotypes (\u201cif we want more non-white people we need spicier food and fewer long position papers\u201d)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>tokenizing the members of the target demographic who you do have (\u00a0\u201chey, will you be the organization president? you don\u2019t have to do any work but we need a black person on the leadership board\u201d )</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>not\u00a0<span>asking</span>\u00a0people in the groups you're trying to reach what they think or recommend (\u00a0\u201cAs a man, I\u2019m concerned that we have too many men, and here\u2019s how I think we should go about fixing it\u201d)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>treating the members of the targeted demographic who you do have like they\u2019re zoo animals (\u00a0\u201cA woman interested in Our Movement?

My suspicion is that the best way to increase demographic diversity is through project partnerships with groups that are skewed towards people we lack; collaborating with a local racial justice group on a fundraiser for GiveDirectly, for example, or with an environmental group on a cost-benefit analysis of different forms of climate change intervention advocacy. Partnerships for specific projects reduce the risk of value drift and, if the groups turn out to be incompatible, make it easy to part on good terms and maybe win over a few members who are intrigued by the EA approach.\u00a0</span></div></div></div>"},

Thanks to the growing effective altruism movement, lots of essays have been written around the topic of charity effectiveness over the last five years. And many of the key insights are gathered together in the Effective Altruism Handbook, which has become available today.</p>\n<p>The Effective Altruism Handbook includes an introduction by William MacAskill and Peter Singer followed by five sections. The first section motivates the rest of the book, giving an overview of why people care about effectiveness. The second through fourth sections address tricky decisions involved in helping others: evaluating charities, choosing a career and prioritizing causes. In the final section, the leaders of seven organizations describe why they're doing what they're doing, and describe the kinds of activities they consider especially helpful.</p>\n<p>A lot of conversations have gone into picking out the materials for this compilation, so I hope you enjoy reading it!</p>\n<p><strong id=\"The_Effective_Altruism_Handbook_can_be_freely_downloaded_here_\"><span>The <a href=\"http://bit.ly/EA_Handbook\">Effective Altruism Handbook</a> can be freely downloaded <a href=\"http://bit.ly/EA_Handbook\">here</a>.</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>There are also\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/eahepub\">epub</a><span>\u00a0and\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/eahmobi\">mobi</a><span>\u00a0versions for readers using ebook devices, although their formatting has not been edited as carefully.</span></p>\n<p>Thanks to all of the authors in this compilation for writing their essays in the first place, as well as for making them available for the Handbook. Thanks to Alex Vermeer from MIRI for helping massively by offering his experience and assistance with working in LaTeX to produce this kind of book. Thanks also to Bastian Stern, the Centre for Effective Altruism, Peter Orr (for proofreading), and Lauryn Vaughan for cover design. Also, thanks kindly to Agata Sagan who is helping by making a Polish translation!

To solve this problem, we need to think about how to reframe our core ideas and about the language we use to communicate.</span></p>\n<p><span>The following analysis will be based on:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Evolutionary Psychology</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Group Psychology</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Signaling Theory</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Heuristic and Biases</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>And some other areas of psychology</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>The important insights that we can draw from these fields of knowledge are that:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Humans are cognitive misers. They avoid doing mental effort and rely heavily on heuristics, which often produce biases.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Humans care a lot about social status and determining who their allies and enemies are.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Humans are susceptible to </span><a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Priming\"><span>priming</span></a><span> and are heavily driven by chains of associations and meanings.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>All of these claims are familiar to readers of </span><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com\"><span>Less Wrong</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com\"><span>Overcoming Bias</span></a><span> and books like </span><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/cb1/thinking_and_deciding_a_chapter_by_chapter_review/\"><span>Thinking and deciding</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow\"><span>Thinking, Fast and Slow</span></a><span> and books about </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology\"><span>Evolutionary psychology</span></a><span>, among many others.</span></p>\n<p><span>Based on these facts about human psychology, I make the following important claims:</span></p>\n<p><span>1) While the quality and intellectual rigor of our arguments is important, the success of effective altruism depends even more on the things that people automatically associate with the movement.</span></p>\n<p><span>2) To influence society, we have to be associated with very good things. The words \u201cEffective altruism\u201d should generate an automatic chain of positive associations and feelings. </span></p>\n<p><span>We have to ask ourselves the following questions:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>What kind of feelings does Effective altruism generate on newcomers? </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>How are we perceived by society?</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>And most importantly:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Can we reframe our arguments and change the presentation of our movement in such a way that we start generating the right kind of associations?</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Effective altruism should retain a high level of intellectual rigor, while seeking ways to attract a broader public. At the very least, we should seek to be associated with positive words. To accomplish this, we don\u2019t need to change our ideas or to simplify them. We just need to rewrite and reframe them in ways that are more adjusted to human psychology.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>1) Effective altruism is currently associated with many negative adjectives.</span></p>\n<p><span>We know that effective altruism has amazing people. There are many intelligent and altruistic persons in this movement. The quality of the people in our movement is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen. But the important question is:</span></p>\n<p><span>Does the average outsider know this?</span></p>\n<p><span>I claim that they don\u2019t. In fact, I think many outsiders will think </span><span>the opposite</span><span> about the members of this movement.</span></p>\n<p><span>Effective altruism is currently being associated with the following negative adjectives and ideas:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Heartless</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>We are people that quantify and take decisions based on numbers, and this is seen as cold and heartless. We put emphasis on ignoring our emotions and gut-feelings when it comes to altruism. To top it off, we frequently talk about helping people in other countries and about ignoring our local communities and those close to us. We are seen as utility-maximizing machines.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>\u201cRational\u201d, </span><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/90n/summary_of_the_straw_vulcan/\"><span>in a Straw Vulcan sense</span></a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>We are seen as people opposed to warm human emotions.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Judgmental and narcissistic</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>We can come off as implying that any form of spending money that isn\u2019t the ones we recommend is immoral. We are \u201ceffective altruists\u2019\u2019, and it may seem that we imply that everybody else is just wasting their time and being stupid. In fact, our logic seems to imply that everybody else is responsible for the death and the parasitic infections of countless humans.</span></p>\n<p><span>This is unfortunate, because we don\u2019t want to come off as moralistic and judgmental, but sometimes we do.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Insensitive to social justice</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Judgmental, utility-maximizing machines in an ivory tower know nothing about the struggle of real people.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Many other associated negative adjectives.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>You can find these negative adjectives in any critique of effective altruism. They are quite common. Even someone as nice as </span><a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/2014/02/too-narrow.html\"><span>Julia Wise says</span></a><span> that she was often categorized as \u201csome kind of heartless utility-bot\u201d.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>But of course, </span><span>all those negative adjectives aren\u2019t accurate</span><span>. For example, we aren\u2019t heartless: our movement has some of the most compassionate people in the world, and we do the math because we care. </span></p>\n<p><span>We just didn\u2019t make a big effort to avoid these kinds of negative associations, </span><span>which are completely understandable from the perspective of an outsider.</span></p>\n<p><span>Even many smart people won\u2019t stick long enough to read our rational arguments. </span><span>They will briefly come in contact with us, some negative associations will be triggered because we are not framing our arguments correctly, and they will leave.</span></p>\n<p><span>We can counter these kinds of negative associations if we change our strategy and pay attention. And we should really seek to do this. We will fail to gain support from very valuable people if we keep being associated with negative ideas.</span></p>\n<p><span>Nobody wants to take a status hit by supporting a group that is seen in a negative light by the general public, even if said group is doing really important things.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>2) Changing how effective altruism is perceived</span></p>\n<p><span>Let\u2019s look at this:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>We use evidence and reason to ask \"Where can a small set of individuals make the biggest difference?\" We\u2019re entrepreneurs and economists. CEOs and scientists. Students and philanthropists. And if you're ready to rethink social impact, you're ready to join us.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>This description of the movement comes from the </span><a href=\"http://effectivealtruism.org/\"><span>main effective altruism site</span></a><span>. It\u2019s the first thing that many people will see about our movement. We should ask ourselves \u201cdoes this generate the right impression about our movement?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span>I claim that it doesn\u2019t. Let\u2019s think in terms of </span><span>Warm words</span><span> and </span><span>Cold words.</span></p>\n<p><span>Evidence, Reason, Scientists, Entrepreneurs, CEOs and Social impact are all </span><span>Cold words</span><span>. They won\u2019t generate many warm feelings in the general public, even if many of them are positive. </span><span>We must use these Cold words to describe our project, but we must remember that these words can have a strong positive impact if they are close to Warm words.</span></p>\n<p><span>Empathy, Heart, Compassion, Save, Connection and Kindness</span><span> are all examples of </span><span>Warm words.</span><span> They generate good feelings in those that read them and </span><span>improve how the words close to them are perceived.</span></p>\n<p><span>How many Warm words do we have in the main description of Effective altruism? </span><span>There are zero Warm words.</span><span> Overlooking these kinds of things in the main description of our movement might be harmful over time.</span></p>\n<p><span>We do this all the time. We throw ten cold words without using a single warm word. This is okay when we write about theory, but </span><span>we should avoid this when we write for the general public.</span></p>\n<p><span>We are warm people, so using more warm words also represents us more accurately. These changes aren\u2019t about lying to the public, but about transmitting our genuine enthusiasm.</span></p>\n<p><span>This isn\u2019t the fault of the person that wrote the description. The fact is that many of us saw it and thought there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with it (including myself). We are sometimes being blind to some important subtleties of human psychology.</span></p>\n<p><span>Fixing this will go a long ways towards getting rid of the \u201cheartless\u201d association. We will create a better impression by using more Warm words. When journalists write about Effective altruism, they will use the same Warm words that we use, and they may even be more charitable with us when it comes to article titles.</span></p>\n<p><span>Main takeaway: When writing for the general public, we should use more Warm words. Looking for the proportion of Cold words VS Warm words should be in the to-do list of any effective altruist that is writing for the general public. And remember that this isn\u2019t just about persuasion. This is about also about being accurate. We are Warm people and we need to transmit that.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>3) Critics say: ''On the utilitarian view, a pound spent without maximal effect is a pound spent immorally.'' </span></p>\n<p><span>This quote comes from a </span><a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n18/amia-srinivasan/stop-the-robot-apocalypse\"><span>recent critique of effective altruism</span></a><span>, which unfortunately plays up the more calculating side of effective altruism.</span></p>\n<p><span>The implicit claim that the critic is making in that quote is that effective altruists think that any way of helping that is different from what they recommend is immoral.</span></p>\n<p><span>The impression that this generates is that Effective altruists are judgmental and narcissistic.</span></p>\n<p><span>We frequently critique charities that are worse than those we recommend. It\u2019s not hard for critics to imagine that we spend all our time narcissistically talking about the immorality of those that don\u2019t make the same choices that we do. </span></p>\n<p><span>We must insist on the fact that some charities are better than others by a huge amount. We should never give up on that point, but we must say it in a different way.</span></p>\n<p><span>Saying or implying that others are immoral and stupid can put the philanthropic sector against us, and generates exactly the wrong kind of associations in the general public.</span></p>\n<p><span>Consider what this imaginary effective altruist said: \u00a0</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>\u201cEvery altruist is a kind, wonderful person trying to do something good for the world. All of them are my allies, but good could be done even better. We talk about effective altruism because we care deeply about the people, and we hope that altruists all over the world will join our movement and start thinking in terms of cost-effectiveness.\u201d</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>This effective altruist doesn\u2019t sound like a judgmental person or someone eager to critique bad charities or people that help others in stupid ways. On the contrary, he recognizes that every altruist is a colleague of his. Every altruist is a kind soul in this difficult world, trying to fix things. The fact that he talks about effective altruism seems linked to his big desire to help others, not with a desire to judge or to claim that others are immoral.</span></p>\n<p><span>This is reframing. We are still saying that some ways of helping others are much better, but we are doing so in a way that cancels any kind of negative associations and triggers only good ones.</span></p>\n<p><span>Main takeaway: We should never put emphasis on how immoral others are. Rather, we must focus on how much better it would be if they followed our recommendations and started thinking in terms of cost-effectiveness. We must show kindness towards every altruist, even if they aren\u2019t effective at the moment.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>4) Our readers are effective altruists</span></p>\n<p><span>Almost every person that comes in contact with effective altruism will already think that:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Poverty is terrible and we should get rid of it.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>We should help people if we can afford it.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>It\u2019s better to help as many people as possible.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Your readers are effective altruists already. Tell it to them! Show them that effective altruism is a natural consequence of their beliefs.</span></p>\n<p><span>When we write for the general public, let\u2019s stop for a second and remind the reader that our position is the same as theirs.</span></p>\n<p><span>There aren\u2019t many better ways to generate warm feelings and predispose our readers to be charitable towards us than showing them that we think the same that they do.</span></p>\n<p><span>Main takeaway: Make the readers identify with the movement. Tell them that they already agree with what we propose.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>5) A critic might say, \u201cYour dollars might go further overseas, but if you send them there, you are heartless\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span>Are you blind to the plight of those around you? Are you so high up in your ivory tower that you can\u2019t see that people close to you are suffering? How can you ignore them?</span></p>\n<p><span>\u2026But of course, we don\u2019t ignore them, and we are not in an ivory tower. </span><span>There is a limited amount of resources, and we can do more good if we focus on helping those in third world countries.</span></p>\n<p><span>The problem is that the public isn\u2019t well aware of this. They see that we reject the notion of helping those around us and they suspect</span><span>. This is reasonable from their perspective. </span><span>We can easily appear as cold, emotionally detached and robotic.</span></p>\n<p><span>The previous advice goes a long way towards preventing this. But we can handle this specific problem even better.</span></p>\n<p><span>Consider what this imaginary effective altruist said:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>\u201cWe understand the drive to help those closer to us. We feel a strong connection to every person that is struggling in this world, and naturally the plight of those that we can see with our own eyes affects us deeply. The people that help locally are wonderful, and we completely share their feelings. But we also think of those that are far away.</span></p>\n<p><span>It takes a lot of effort to put yourself in the place of someone you have never seen. But if you do, you will find that their lives are worth just as much as those close to us. And we can help them even more!\u201d</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>Notice how this is framed in such a way that it implies that giving overseas requires even more empathy, while at the same time avoids putting those that help locally in a negative light. The high density of Warm words will also ensure that the point is accepted easily.</span></p>\n<p><span>Main takeaway: being warm is especially important when you are making a point that may imply that effective altruism is \u201cheartless\u201d or \u201cemotionally detached\u201d. \u00a0Let the public know that our decisions are a consequence of our empathy.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>We still have to think about many other topics linked to outreach, but if we remember the advice mentioned in this text, I think we will do great.</span></p>\n<p><span>This is part 1 of a series of texts about strategic communication for effective altruism.<br> </span></p>\n<hr>\n<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings>

{"date": "1st Feb 2015", "title": "EA Diversity: Unpacking Pandora's Box", "author": "AGB", "num_comments": "7 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><strong id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>I hate talking about diversity. I hate watching other people talk about diversity more*. My first reaction to the (most) <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/812909868765372/\">recent</a>\u00a0thread in the EA Facebook group about diversity was 'oh God, not this again'**. So I have a lot of sympathy for the view, most commonly expressed by social conservatives, that as a society we should spend a whole lot less time thinking and talking about diversity and a whole lot more time deciding on merit. On a purely selfish level, I would enjoy life more that way.</p>\n<p>The reasons why I hate this topic are varied, and some of them are too petty or personal to be worth expressing here, but a few of the more intellectual reasons are relevant:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This whole area is a communication minefield; words like 'diversity', 'political correctness', and 'social justice' mean dramatically different things to different people. Without active efforts to avoid said mines, participants in such a debate are likely to end up <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/np/disputing_definitions/\">disputing definitions</a>.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_projection_fallacy\">Mind Projection fallacy</a> is deadly on a topic where views tend to be both strongly entrenched and strongly based on (divergent) personal experiences. Large gaps in experience lead to large <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/kg/expecting_short_inferential_distances/\">inferential distances</a>, and large inferential distances make persuasion difficult. That is, it is difficult even when you know they exist, never mind when you don't.</li>\n<li>The above combine in a nasty way. Opaque or incomplete arguments can get uncritical support from those who agree with the conclusions, partly because their knowledge or experience allow them to unconsciously 'fill in the blanks' and partly because of the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lj/the_halo_effect/\">halo effect</a>. And lots of arguments, in any debate, on any side, are <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/ke/illusion_of_transparency_why_no_one_understands/\">opaque or incomplete</a>. The danger is that you end up with two groups talking past each other, neither of them having the ability and willingness to bridge the gap, yet both increasingly confident in 'their' position as they are reinforced by 'their' group. Which in all probability they just\u00a0<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/gz/policy_debates_should_not_appear_onesided/\">shouldn't be</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reading the above, you could reasonably ask: why am I of all people writing a post about diversity? Because at some point I looked at the world and considered the evidence. Unfortunately for me, my best guess is that diversity is rather important. In particular, I think that it is too important to be left to the type of discussion I just described, and I want to make the case for why it deserves at least some of our attention.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong id=\"Getting_it_clear\">Getting it clear</strong></p>\n<p>As noted, diversity can mean a variety of different things. The different things have different upsides. I'm going to non-exhaustively focus on four types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Diversity of talent.</li>\n<li>Diversity of experience.</li>\n<li>Diversity of opinion.</li>\n<li>Diversity of appearance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I want to talk about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What does this mean? Why does it matter?</li>\n<li>How are we doing?</li>\n<li>What could we do better?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I certainly do <em>not</em> think I have all the answers, especially to the last of those. My hope is that by approaching things in this way we will at least be asking the right (well-defined, relevant, interesting) questions.</p>\n<p>Finally, I want to pre-empt the obvious response that these are interlinked; in particular your experiences are linked to your talents, opinions, and appearance. My point is that different types of diversity have different upsides, and that while you can get multiple types at once, you often will not. So I still think they're worth considering separately.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong id=\"Talent\"><em>Talent</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you want to get things done and done well, you need a variety of types of people to get there. You need the analytically-minded. You need organisers. You need leaders. You need communicators. And so on. People have widely differing skills and knowledge, and we achieve more by complementing each other, allowing each of us individually to focus on what we're really good at. This idea appears in economics at the country level, in the form of <a href=\"http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Global_economics/Comparative_advantage.html\">comparative advantage</a>. On the level of small groups, the concept of varying skills meaning more productivity has a <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2007/04/the-leadership-team-complementary-strengths-or-conflicting-agendas\">long history, in business and out</a>.</p>\n<p>EA is heavy on mathematicians, programmers, economists and philosophers. Those groups can get a lot done, but they can't get everything done. If we want to grow, I think we could do with more PR types. Because we're largely web-based, people who understand how to make things visually appealing also seem valuable. My personal experience in London is that we would love more organisers, though I can imagine this varying by location.</p>\n<p>With that said, this is not an area I'm too worried about in the medium term. We're doing pretty well at elite universities. Elite universities score poorly on the other types of diversity I mentioned, but they do turn out people who go into a variety of fields with a variety of strengths; they are diverse in this sense. Just expanding our recruitment there would fix this problem. On a more personal level, I haven't had any difficulty talking about EA to my non-quantitative, non-analytical friends...from elite universities. I think that's because communication barriers are more often to do with differing experiences than differing talents (see next section).</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong id=\"Experience\"><em>Experience</em></strong></p>\n<p>Different people have different past experiences. Those experiences are often critical in deciding what you find intuitive, who you can relate to, and how you approach the world. Trying to persuade someone of a new idea is hard anyway, and if you have highly divergent past experiences it is doubly hard. The things you believe immediately might be a big leap for them, and vice-versa; once again inferential distances loom large. If we want to expand, we need varying experiences so that we can communicate effectively with a variety of people. Even once people with differing experiences have reached very similar conclusions, those different routes provide ample opportunities for learning and deeper understanding. On the flip side, homogeneous experiences can easily lead to poor evaluation of the choices and opportunities available to those with different experiences.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, this is where EA is weakest. We're overwhelmingly young, overwhelmingly well-educated, and very well-off even by the standards of our\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/05/weird_psychology_social_science_researchers_rely_too_much_on_western_college.html\">WEIRD</a>\u00a0base. We lack parents, we lack people with years of experience in business, public service or charity, and for the most part we lack people for whom money or education or both has been a real struggle. At the risk of stating the obvious, it would be very bad if we ended up unintentionally excluding all of these groups.</p>\n<p>Some of these issues (parents, age, experience) will plausibly fix themselves over time, because current EAs will enter those groups. Sometimes we might need to do a little work to ensure that people don't <a href=\"/ea/ee/on_making_spaces_friendlier_to_parents/\">drop out of EA</a> as they drop in to one of these categories. Other issues, like different backgrounds, require more thought, and I'd welcome ideas others have on what can be done here. It might be as simple as re-framing our arguments depending on the audience, or it might be more fundamental.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong id=\"Opinion\"><em>Opinion</em></strong></p>\n<p>Different people believe different things. To an extent, we expect homogeneous views within a group of people who were brought together by their shared goals; this is true in spite of the fact that <a href=\"/ea/9s/effective_altruism_is_a_question_not_an_ideology/\">Effective Altruism is a question</a>. But it should still be possible to have a lot of thought diversity; most EAs are irreligious, but our popular 10% idea has its roots in tithes. Going further down that line, religious people are <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10885180/Religion-makes-people-more-generous.html\">more likely</a> to give to charity (though the relevance of this is <a href=\"http://www.secularism.org.uk/blog/2014/06/bbc-poll-shows-that-religious-people-give-more-to-charity-than-non-religious-maybe\">disputed</a>) and could be considered a natural target for Singer's arguments. In a similar vein, most EAs are utilitarian, but there's nothing uniquely utilitarian about the idea of EA; you can get to much the same conclusion via the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/\">Golden Rule</a>.\u00a0In so far as it is possible, we should want thought diversity, because the evidence suggests that it allows groups to <a href=\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/01/diversity_of_th.html\">find and correct errors more quickly</a>. Another way of framing the same thing is that high thought diversity makes it easier to distinguish between facts and ideology, because ideologies will have their counter-ideologies expressed within the group.</p>\n<p>I'm more optimistic about this area. We have a good variety views on economics, a noticeable but not overwhelming bias against religion, and a lot of healthy debate within the community generated by differing opinions on many other questions. Perhaps more importantly, I think the broad community already recognises our ability to 'agree-to-disagree' on these areas as a Good Thing. This should allow us to continue in this way and not fall victim to <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lr/evaporative_cooling_of_group_beliefs/\">evaporative cooling</a>.</p>\n<p>Our biggest blind spots are probably that we're short on social conservatives and overwhelmingly <a href=\"/ea/6w/cosmopolitanism/\">cosmopolitan</a>. Perhaps these are just too core to allow compromise on (in which case we might want to reconsider that 'Effective Altruism is not an ideology' claim). But I think that people who are not on board with these views could easily still be on board with EA. For instance, there's no necessary conflict between feeling more attached to those in one's own country, as a non-cosmopolitan might, and donating to charities in other countries, especially when the effectiveness gap appears to be at least an order of magnitude. Certainly my greater attachment to my near and dear doesn't stop me donating to effective charities. I sometimes think we give up a little too easily and say 'well, people with That Particular View are never going to be on board with EA'. Personally, I have more confidence in our ideas than that.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong id=\"Appearance\"><em>Appearance</em></strong></p>\n<p>This is where most debates about diversity start, and sadly where many of them finish, which is why I've left it to last. I am mostly talking about race and gender here, but the same argument could apply to any quickly identifiable characteristic. For example. it probably also applies to groups of highly-educated people, who are often identifiable by the way they speak rather than look. What I'm not going to talk about is discrimination on an individual level. An understated point in this debate is that you don't particularly need racists or sexists to have virtual segregation on race or gender. This is in spite of the fact that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjfihtGefxk\">Schelling's work on this</a> is almost 5 decades old. I'll let Tim Harford (see link) talk for me here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now these brown eggs aren't extreme racists; they're happy to live in a mixed neighbourhood. But they don't want their white neighbours to outnumber their brown neighbours by more than two-to-one...even a mild preference for the colour of your neighbour can lead to extreme segregation...although we as individuals may be rational and we may be tolerant, the society that we produce together may be neither rational nor tolerant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How we are doing here seems incredibly variable by location, so I don't want to generalize too much. One sense in which I think we are arguably doing badly is that many people aren't aware of the Schelling's work and also don't intuitively think in those terms. If someone is a visible minority-of-one in a group, a Good Bayesian should expect that to be contributing to them feeling uncomfortable,\u00a0<strong>even if nobody is actually <em>doing</em> anything to make them uncomfortable</strong>. That person also becomes more valuable in the group, because their very presence makes the next person 'like them' feel more comfortable, and so on. Note how superficial this arguably is compared to other things I've described; merely sharing a race should give you less in common with someone than sharing experiences. But the speed of being able to identify your unusualness matters; first impressions matter.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong id=\"Further_discussion\">Further discussion</strong></p>\n<p>Are there other types of diversity I haven't mentioned, that you think are worthy of note?</p>\n<p>How would you tackle these issues?</p>\n<p>Are they even worth tackling?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>*Denise Melchin can surely vouch for this.</p>\n<p>**The thread isn't actually that bad. As I said, this was my first reaction, and it was before there were many comments.</p></div></div>"},

I give some general considerations on cause selection and then lay out a list of causes followed by a list of organizations. I break up considerations on these causes and organizations into five categories: <em>Size of Impact; Strength of Evidence; Tractability; Neglectedness/Room for More Funding; Learning Value</em>. This roughly mirrors the traditional <em>Importance; Tractability; Neglectedness</em> criteria. I identify which cause areas look most promising. Then I examine a list of organizations working in these cause areas and narrow down to a few finalists. In the last section, I directly compare these finalists against each other and identify which organization looks strongest.</p>\n<p>You can skip to <a href=\"#conclusions\">Conclusions</a> to see summaries of why I prioritize the finalists I chose, why I did not consider any of the other charities as finalists, and my decision about who to fund.</p>\n<p>If you decide to change where you donate as a result of reading this, please tell me!

Document</h2>\n<p>To date, my thinking on cause prioritization has been insufficiently organized or rigorous. This is an attempt to lay out all the considerations in my head for and against different causes and organizations and get some clarity about who to support.</p>\n<p>This is originally inspired by conversations with Buck Shlegeris about the importance of cause prioritization, which he makes a good case for <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10153554042654228?comment_id=10153554093089228&amp;offset=0\">here</a>:</p>\n<p>(Buck makes some non-obvious claims here but I agree with the main thesis that we should spend more effort on cause prioritization.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>EAs spend a tenth as much time discussing cause prioritization as they should. Cause prioritization is <em>obviously</em> incredibly important. If given perfect information you could know that you should be donating to [cause area 1] and you\u2019re actually donating to [cause area 2], then you are doing probably at least an order of magnitude less good than you could be, and I\u2019m only even granting you that much credit because donating to EA charities in [cause area 1] might raise the profile of EA and get more people to donate to [cause area 2] in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If EAs were really interested in doing as much good as they could, then they would want to put their beliefs about cause prioritization under incredible scrutiny. I\u2019m earning to give this year, and I plan to give about 25% of my income. If I could spend a month of my year full time researching cause prioritization, and I thought I was 80% likely to be right about my current cause area, and I thought that this had a 50% chance of changing my cause area from my current cause area to a better one if I were wrong about cause prioritization right now, then it would be worth it for me to do that. [\u2026]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If EAs wanted to help others, they would all maintain a written list of all the strongest arguments against their cause areas from other EAs, and they\u2019d all have their list of rebuttals. Ideally, I\u2019d be able to write a really good document on cause prioritization and sell it for $100, because it would save other EAs so much time figuring this out themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"What_I_Value\">What I Value</h2>\n<p>I value having enjoyable experiences and avoiding unpleasant experiences. If I value these experiences for myself, then it\u2019s reasonable for me to value them in general. That\u2019s the two-sentence version of why I\u2019m a hedonistic utilitarian.</p>\n<p>I have a few more specific beliefs which I believe follow from hedonistic utilitarianism, but a lot of people disagree with, so they are worth stating explicitly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pleasurable and painful experiences in non-humans have moral value. Non-humans includes non-human animals, computer simulations of sentient beings, artificial biological beings, and anything else that can experience pleasure and suffering. \n<ul>\n<li>Corollary: I am persuaded by the <a href=\"http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf\">empirical evidence</a> that chickens, pigs, and probably fish feel pain. <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/do-bugs-feel-pain/\">Insects</a> seem less likely to feel pain but it\u2019s still conceivable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Future beings have equal moral status to existing beings. We might discount them by their probability of existence, but we should not discount them solely because they exist in the future.</li>\n<li>The best possible outcome would be to use fill the universe with beings that experience as much joy as possible for their entire lives. I refer to this outcome as universal eudaimonia (sometimes called <a href=\"http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?t=534\">utilitronium shockwave</a>). \n<ul>\n<li>I have heard only one reasonably compelling argument that this is not the best possible outcome. It may be the case that giving two beings the exact same experience has no more moral value than one being having the experience. I do not see why this would be true, but I am sufficiently confused about this that I do not put much credence in my intuitions. If this claim is true, then we should fill the universe with beings that are optimized for both happiness and diversity of experiences rather than just for happiness. I\u2019m confused about this but hopefully it\u2019s possible to make a good decision about cause prioritization without solving the hard problem of consciousness.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am not perfectly confident that hedonistic utilitarianism is true\u2013I have some <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/moral-uncertainty-towards-a-solution.html\">normative</a> <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf\">uncertainty</a>. At the same time, I do not know what it would mean for hedonistic utilitarianism to be false (I don\u2019t see how suffering could not be inherently bad, and I don\u2019t see how anything other than suffering could be inherently bad). I am open to arguments that it is false, but I am unpersuaded by arguments of the form \u201cutilitarianism produces an unintuitive result in this contrived thought experiment,\u201d and almost all arguments take this form.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Terminology\">Terminology</h2>\n<p>This document is not optimized to be easy to read for people who aren\u2019t familiar with popular effective altruist causes and organizations and has a lot of jargon and abbreviations. That said, I want people to be able to understand what I\u2019m talking about, so I\u2019m happy to offer clarification on specific terms or concepts in the comments section.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Personal_Bias\">Personal Bias</h2>\n<p>Although I try to be as cause-neutral as possible, I feel some emotions that push me in the direction of one cause or another. Throughout this document I try to acknowledge any such feelings. This opens me to criticism along the lines of, \u201cYour arguments for this cause are strong but you are emotionally biased against it; you should consider it more carefully.\u201d</p>\n<h2 id=\"My_Writing_Process\">My Writing Process</h2>\n<p>I wrote this document over time as I researched different causes and organizations. I generally speak about choosing a charity in the future tense, because when I wrote most of this, I had not yet chosen where to donate. While reading this, imagine you are exploring the ideas with me, moving through all the major considerations and reaching a decision near the end of the document.</p>\n<p>I found the process of writing this extremely valuable. I quickly identified which fundamental questions I needed to answer, and I wrote <a href=\"http://mdickens.me/2015/08/15/is_preventing_human_extinction_good/\">separate</a> <a href=\"http://mdickens.me/2015/09/10/on_values_spreading/\">essays</a> to answer a couple of important fundamental questions. Writing this document clarified for me what issues I need to think about when choosing a cause, and I learned a lot about what different organizations are doing and the arguments for and against them. Writing down your mental models is helpful for clarifying them and examining them from a distance.</p>\n<p>I spent about 100 hours producing this document and ultimately changed my mind about where to donate. Even making conservative assumptions about how much I will donate and how much better my choice is now than it would have been, this time spent was worth over $100/hour (and I suspect it\u2019s probably worth more like $500/hour). That said, I found this time enjoyable and probably wouldn\u2019t have put in nearly as much work if it hadn\u2019t been fun. For anyone else who finds this sort of work fun, I strongly encourage you to do it and publish your results in detail.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Related_Writings\">Related Writings</h3>\n<p>I had a few ideas that emerged as a result of working on cause prioritization, and I wrote them as separate essays:</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://mdickens.me/2015/08/15/is_preventing_human_extinction_good/\">Is Preventing Human Extinction Good?</a>, I examine the likely effects of the long-term survival of humanity and consider whether they are good or bad. I come out in favor of preventing extinction being good in expectation, and more likely good than bad.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://mdickens.me/2015/09/10/on_values_spreading/\">On Values Spreading</a>, I discuss the value of values spreading and come to the (weak) conclusion that preventing global catastrophic risks looks more important.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://mdickens.me/2015/09/12/charities_i_would_like_to_see/\">Charities I Would Like to See</a>, I propose a few ideas for potentially high-impact interventions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Things_I_Still_Don_t_Understand\">Things I Still Don\u2019t Understand</h2>\n<p>I still have a few areas of uncertainty. I took a position on these questions, but I have weak confidence about my position. I\u2019d like to see more work in these areas and will continue to think about them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Could high-leverage values spreading be more important than global catastrophic risk reduction?</li>\n<li>Can we actually have success with far-future interventions when we don\u2019t have good feedback loops?</li>\n<li>How much evidence should I require before supporting a speculative cause?</li>\n<li>When is supporting a meta-charity not worth it?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Acknowledgments\">Acknowledgments</h2>\n<p>I have many people to thank for helping me produce this document.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Nick Beckstead, Daniel Dewey, Ruairi Donnelly, Eric Herboso, Victoria Krakovna, Howie Lempel, Toby Ord, Tobias Pulver, Joey Savoie, Carl Shulman, Nate Soares, Pablo Stafforini, Brian Tomasik, Emily Cutts Worthington, and Eliezer Yudkowsky for answering my questions about their work and discussing ideas with me.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Jacy Anthis, Linda Dickens, Jeff Jordan, Kelsey Piper, Buck Shlegeris, and Claire Zabel for reviewing drafts and helping me develop my thoughts on cause selection.</p>\n<p>If I inadvertently left out anyone else, then I apologize, and thanks to you, too.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Causes\">Causes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"Global_Poverty\">Global Poverty</h2>\n<p>Among global poverty charities, the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF\">Against Malaria Foundation (AMF)</a> probably has the strongest case that it saves lives effectively. There\u2019s strong evidence that it helps humans in the short run, but I have some concerns about its larger effects. Does AMF (or other global poverty charities) negatively impact wild animals? Does making humans better off hurt the far future? My best guess on both these questions is \u201cno,\u201d but I have a lot of uncertainty about them, so the case for AMF is not as clear-cut as it first appears. That said, if every potentially high-impact but more speculative cause that I consider has insufficient evidence that it\u2019s effective, I may donate to AMF. I consider this something of a fallback position: AMF is the strongest charity unless another charity can show that it\u2019s better.</p>\n<p>I do not discuss global poverty charities in depth here because I do not believe I have much to add to GiveWell\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">extensive analysis</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Factory_Farming\">Factory Farming</h2>\n<p>Some charities such as <a href=\"http://thehumaneleague.com/\">The Humane League</a> work to prevent animals from suffering on factory farms. There\u2019s a plausible case that some such charities do much more good than GiveWell top charities (perhaps by an <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/interventions/online-ads/online-ads-calculator/\">order of magnitude or more</a>), although the supporting evidence here is much weaker.</p>\n<p>Similarly to global poverty, reducing factory farming <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/vegan-advocacy-and-pessimism-about-wild.html\">may be net harmful</a> in the short run. Reducing factory farming might reduce speciesism and spread good values in the long term, but this claim is highly speculative. Then it\u2019s not a question of comparing speculative far-future causes versus proven factory farming: the case for the long-term benefits of reducing factory farming is on no firmer ground than the case for global catastrophic risk charities. I discuss values spreading as a separate cause below.</p>\n<p>Charities against factory farming do not serve as a fallback position in the same way that GiveWell top charities do, because the evidence in their favor is a lot weaker. The state of this evidence is improving, and funding studies on animal advocacy could be highly effective; see my <a href=\"#animal-charity-evaluators-ace\">discussion</a> of Animal Charity Evaluators.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Far_Future__General_\">Far Future (General)</h2>\n<p>Almost all utility lives in the far future. Thus, it\u2019s likely that the most effective interventions are ones that positively affect the far future. But this line of reasoning has a major problem: it\u2019s not at all obvious how to positively affect the far future. Some, such as <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/why-global-poverty\">Jeff Kaufman</a>, believe this is sufficient reason to focus on short-term interventions instead.</p>\n<p>Short-term interventions such as <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly\">direct cash transfers</a> will always have stronger evidence in their favor than far future interventions. But the far future is so <a href=\"https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/40469/\">overwhelmingly important</a> that I believe our best bet is to support far future causes whenever we can find charities with reasonably good indicators of their effectiveness (e.g. success at achieving short-term goals or competent leadership). It\u2019s conceivable that we won\u2019t be able to find any sufficiently reliable charities (and this was my impression when I first investigated the issue a few years ago), but it\u2019s worth trying.</p>\n<p>I used to prefer short-term interventions with clear supporting evidence\u2013I supported GiveWell top charities and, later, ACE top charities and ACE itself. But after a few conversations with Carl Shulman, Pablo Stafforini, Buck Shlegeris and others, I started more seriously considering the fact that almost all value lives in the far future, and the best interventions are probably those that focus on it. This is not to say that we should donate to whatever charity can give a naive argument that it has the highest expected value. When I discuss specific far-future charities below, I look for indicators on whether their activities are effective. I would not give to a far-future charity unless it had compelling evidence that its activities would be impactful. Obviously this evidence will not be as strong as the evidence in favor of GiveWell top charities, but there still exist far-future charities with better and worse evidence of impact.</p>\n<p>We should be cautious about being lenient with a cause area\u2019s strength of evidence. Jeff Kaufman <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/why-global-poverty\">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People succeed when they have good feedback loops. Otherwise they tend to go in random directions. This is a problem for charity in general, because we\u2019re buying things for others instead of for ourselves. If I buy something and it\u2019s no good I can complain to the shop, buy from a different shop, or give them a bad review. If I buy you something and it\u2019s no good, your options are much more limited. Perhaps it failed to arrive but you never even knew you were supposed to get it? Or it arrived and was much smaller than I intended, but how do you know. Even if you do know that what you got is wrong, chances are you\u2019re not really in a position to have your concerns taken seriously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[\u2026]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[With AI risk, the] problem is we really really don\u2019t know how to make good feedback loops here. We can theorize that an AI needs certain properties not to just kill us all, and that in order to have those properties it would be useful to have certain theorems proved, and go work on those theorems. And maybe we have some success at this, and the mathematical community thinks highly of us instead of dismissing our work. But if our reasoning about what math would be useful is off there\u2019s no way for us to find out. Everything will still seem like it\u2019s going well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>AI risk and other speculative causes don\u2019t have good feedback loops, but we don\u2019t know nothing about whether we\u2019re succeeding. And there\u2019s reason to believe we should support speculative causes. As Nick Beckstead <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/i9u/what_would_it_take_to_prove_a_speculative_cause/9k6r\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My overall impression is that the average impact of people doing the most promising unproven activities contributed to a large share of the innovations and scientific breakthroughs that have made the world so much better than it was hundreds of years ago, despite the fact that they were a small share of all human activity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The best interventions are probably those that significantly affect the far future, although probably many (or even most) far-future interventions do nothing useful. We should try to improve the far future, but be careful about naive claims of high cost-effectiveness and look for indicators that far-future charities are competent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Values_Spreading_to_Improve_the_Far_Future\">Values Spreading to Improve the Far Future</h2>\n<p>Some people propose focusing on spreading values now to increase the probability that the far future has beneficial results. I have never seen any strong reason to believe that anything we do now will affect far future values\u2013if the case for organizations reducing global catastrophic risks is tenuous, then the case for values spreading is no better.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/vegan-advocacy-and-pessimism-about-wild.html\">Vegan Advocacy and Pessimism about Wild Animal Welfare</a>, Carl Shulman points out that vegan advocacy could be bad for animals in the short-run (although <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/vegetarianism-and-wild-animals/\">Brian Tomasik believes</a> it has positive short-run effects), so the main benefit comes from values spreading; but the benefits of values spreading are unclear.</p>\n<p>I discuss this subject in more depth in <a href=\"http://mdickens.me/2015/09/10/on_values_spreading/\">On Values Spreading</a>. I conclude that there are good arguments that values spreading is the most effective activity, but it has some serious considerations against it and global catastrophic risk reduction looks more important.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Global_Catastrophic_Risk_Reduction\">Global Catastrophic Risk Reduction</h2>\n<p>I include existential risks as a type of global catastrophic risk (GCR). Nick Bostrom has <a href=\"http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.html\">argued</a> that existential risks are substantially worse than other GCRs. Nick Beckstead <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/08/13/the-long-term-significance-of-reducing-global-catastrophic-risks/\">disagrees</a>, and I find Beckstead\u2019s case persuasive.</p>\n<p>It appears to be the case that either (1) working on GCR reduction in general is the best thing to do, in which case there may be multiple different cause areas within GCR that are more effective than any non-GCR causes; or (2) working on GCR is not the best thing to do, in which case all cause areas within GCR are similarly ineffective. (In case (1), lots of GCR interventions may still be ineffective, for example, research on preventing alien hamster invasions.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"Is_preventing_human_extinction_good_\">Is preventing human extinction good?</h3>\n<p>This section getting so in-depth that I moved it into a <a href=\"http://mdickens.me/2015/08/15/is_preventing_human_extinction_good/\">separate article</a>. In summary: there are a few reasons why the impact of humanity on the far future could be negative; but overall, it looks like humanity\u2019s impact has a positive expected value (and will probably be positive), so it\u2019s highly valuable to ensure that human civilization continues to exist.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Size_of_Impact\">Size of Impact</h3>\n<p>Preventing global catastrophic risk is a sufficiently important problem that fairly small efforts in the right direction can have much larger long-term effects than GiveWell-recommended charities (see Beckstead\u2019s dissertation <a href=\"https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/40469/\">\u201cOn the Overwhelming Importance of Shaping the Far Future\u201d</a>). Successful GCR interventions probably have a bigger positive impact than anything else except possibly ensuring that the beings controlling the far future have good values (although I believe GCR reduction is probably more important, for reasons discussed above).</p>\n<h3 id=\"Strength_of_Evidence\">Strength of Evidence</h3>\n<p>Previously, I had major concerns about whether any GCR interventions had any effect. However, with Open Phil\u2019s recent research into GCRs, I am more confident that there will emerge opportunities with sufficiently strong evidence of effectiveness that they make good giving targets. Open Phil has high standards of rigor, and I trust it to recommend interventions that have strong arguments in their favor.</p>\n<p>Due to the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/04/the-haste-consideration/\">haste consideration</a>, I want to seriously consider donating to GCR interventions this year or next year. The evidence for the effectiveness of GCR organizations is uniformly much weaker than the evidence for GiveWell top charities, but this does not rule them out as contenders for the best cause area. Their overwhelming importance means I am willing to be more lenient about their strength of evidence than I would be for proximate interventions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Neglectedness\">Neglectedness</h3>\n<p>GCR reduction as a cause is highly neglected right now, but more large donors are showing an interest in the topic, so it\u2019s plausible that it will receive more funding in the future. Even so, funding it now may provide more information for future donors and help the field grow more quickly. Additionally, there\u2019s the haste consideration: we don\u2019t know when a major global catastrophe will occur or how long it will take to prepare for, so we should begin preparing as early as possible. Something like unfriendly AI is probably at least two decades away, but it will probably take more than two decades to develop solid theory around friendly AI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Tractability\">Tractability</h3>\n<p>It\u2019s not obvious what counts as evidence that a GCR intervention is working. I discuss this specifically with regard to the individual organizations that I consider.</p>\n<h2 id=\"AI_Safety\">AI Safety</h2>\n<p>Preventing unfriendly AI might successfully avert human extinction, which would have an extremely large impact. Furthermore, building a friendly AI is plausibly more important than any other GCR if it enables us to produce astronomically good outcomes that we would not be able to produce otherwise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Friendly_AI_and_Non_Human_Animals\">Friendly AI and Non-Human Animals</h3>\n<p>Given that non-human animals may dominate the expected value of the far future, it\u2019s important that an AI gives them appropriate consideration. I discuss this issue in a few places in this document. Here I have a couple of additional quick points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An AI-controlled future could be much better or much worse than a human-controlled future because a superintelligent AI would have more power to shape the universe than unaided humans.</li>\n<li>Research on cooperation between goal-agents is possibly more valuable than research on encoding human values, because it\u2019s probably less likely to lead to a far future that\u2019s very bad for animals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"GCRs_Other_than_AI_Safety\">GCRs Other than AI Safety</h2>\n<p>I do not know of any good ways to fund organizations putting work into individual GCRs other than AI safety. I agree with Open Phil\u2019s assessment that biosecurity and geoengineering are highly promising (although I have only briefly investigated these areas, so much of my confidence comes from Open Phil\u2019s position and not from my own research). I do not see reason to believe that some GCR other than AI risk is substantially more important; <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/gcr-report.pdf\">no GCR looks much more likely than AI risk</a>, and right now it looks much easier to efficiently support efforts to improve AI safety than to support work on other major GCRs. I expect that there\u2019s perhaps some geoengineering research worth funding, but I don\u2019t have the expertise to identify it and I don\u2019t know how to find geoengineering research that\u2019s funding-constrained.</p>\n<p>FLI has published a <a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/resources/biotechnology\">list of organizations</a> working on biotechnology, although if I tried to read through this list and find ones worth supporting, I would do a poor job; if someone with some domain knowledge looked through these to find ones potentially worth donating to, that could be highly valuable. I believe I understand AI safety well enough to roughly assess organizations in the field, but this is not the case with any other GCR.</p>\n<p>If I did come to the conclusion that some specific GCR other than AI safety was the most important, I should probably try to use Open Phil\u2019s research to learn more. I discuss this potential giving opportunity in \u201cOpen Phil-Recommended GCR Charities\u201d below. I would also encourage other EAs, especially those with some knowledge about some relevant field such as biosecurity, to explore the available options and publicly write about any good giving opportunities they find.</p>\n<p>If a sufficiently strong giving opportunity arises in a field of GCR reduction other than AI safety, I will seriously consider it; but at present I don\u2019t see any.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Movement_Building\">Movement Building</h2>\n<p>Effective charities that work to reduce GCRs may be many times better than global poverty charities, so organizations that create new EAs may largely be valuable insofar as they create new donations to GCR charities. If I thought global poverty were the best cause, then meta-organizations that attempt to grow the donation base may be even better. But if GCR reduction is vastly more important, then movement-building charities produce most of their value from a small set of donors who support GCR reduction.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s possible that there exist movement-building organizations that produce a sufficiently large benefit to outweigh donations to effective GCR charities. I discuss this possibility when looking at individual movement-building organizations below. But in the general case, I expect that donating directly to the best object-level charity will have a higher impact than donating to movement building organizations.</p>\n<p>There are a few additional concerns with supporting movement building; Peter Hurford discusses the most important ones <a href=\"/ea/my/ea_risks_falling_into_a_meta_trap_but_we_can/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Meta_Research\">Meta-Research</h2>\n<p>Meta-research (which mostly means charity evaluation, although it also could include things like Charity Science\u2019s research on fundraising strategies) potentially has a lot of value if it successfully discovers new interventions with bigger impact or room for more funding than any current interventions that are popular among EAs. It\u2019s hard to predict when this will actually happen, and depends on to what extent you believe EAs have identified the best interventions already. But I\u2019m generally optimistic about efforts to produce new knowledge.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Organizations\">Organizations</h1>\n<p>Here I briefly discuss the major considerations for and against every organization I have seriously considered. The organizations are grouped roughly by category and otherwise listed in no particular order.</p>\n<p>I do not discuss a number of potentially promising organizations because surface signs show that they are unlikely to be the most effective charity, and I couldn\u2019t find good enough information about them to feel confident about donating to them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute__MIRI_\">Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI)</h2>\n<p><em>Emotional disclosure: I feel vaguely uncomfortable about MIRI. Originally I was bothered by Eliezer\u2019s lack of concern for animals and worried that he would make decisions to benefit humans at the expense of other conscious minds; MIRI\u2019s new director Nate Soares does seem to give appropriate value to non-human animals, so this is less of a concern. I also was bothered by how hard it was to tell if it was doing anything good. Today, it is more transparent and produces more tangible results. This second concern may still be significant, but it is over-weighted in my emotional response to MIRI. I still have an intuitive reaction that AI research isn\u2019t as good as actually helping people or animals, but I try to ignore this because I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s rational.</em></p>\n<p>The evidence for MIRI\u2019s effectiveness is considerably weaker than for GiveWell top charities. I have some concerns, but I see a number of reasons to expect that MIRI is succeeding at achieving its short-term goals, which gives me confidence in its organizational competence. It doesn\u2019t have some of the same problems I see with FLI (which I discuss in the separate <a href=\"#future-of-life-institute\">section on FLI</a>), which makes me prefer MIRI over FLI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Strength_of_Evidence1\">Strength of Evidence</h3>\n<p>MIRI is trying to improve outcomes in the future, so it\u2019s not clear what qualifies as evidence that MIRI is currently doing a good job. We can\u2019t get direct evidence without predicting the future, so here are a few things I look for:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Its researchers and leadership appear competent and devoted to the problem.</li>\n<li>It has high research output and its research is well-regarded by others in the field.</li>\n<li>It successfully convinces other AI researchers that alignment is an important problem.</li>\n<li>Respected AI researchers endorse MIRI as effective.</li>\n<li>It is transparent and makes an effort to publicly disclose its activities, accomplishments, and failures.</li>\n<li>Its researchers care about non-human animals.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"Competence\">Competence</h4>\n<p>Based on personal conversations with MIRI researchers and reading their public writings, I get the impression that they have a strong grasp on which sub-problems in AI safety are important and how to make progress on them. I have only had fairly limited personal interactions with MIRI researchers; the most extensive interaction I had was when I attended a MIRIx workshop where we discussed their paper <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5577\">\u201cRobust Cooperation in the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\u201d</a>. The problem this paper attempts to solve has clear relevance to AI safety\u2013we would like superintelligent agents to cooperate with us and with each other on real-world prisoner\u2019s dilemmas\u2013and the paper makes obvious steps toward solving this problem while also outlining what remains unsolved.</p>\n<p>More broadly, the items listed on MIRI\u2019s <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf\">technical agenda</a> look like important and urgent problems. At the very least, MIRI appears competent at identifying significant research problems that it needs to solve. My impression is that MIRI is doing a better job than anyone else at identifying the important problems, although this is difficult to justify explicitly.</p>\n<p>We have to consider how competent MIRI is compared to other researchers we could fund: perhaps if some other people were working on the sorts of problems that MIRI works on, they would solve them much more quickly and efficiently. I find this somewhat unlikely. I have read a lot of writings by Eliezer Yudkowsky, Luke Muehlhauser, and Nate Soares (Eliezer is the founder and senior researcher, Luke is the ex-director, and Nate is current director), and they strike me as intelligent people with strong analytic skills and a good grasp of the AI alignment problem. I briefly looked through the FLI grantees, and MIRI\u2019s research plan seems more obviously important for AI safety than many of the grantees.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Published_research\">Published research</h4>\n<p>Although MIRI published little before 2014, it has started <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/all-publications/\">publishing more papers</a> since then. I haven\u2019t engaged much with its research papers but a cursory examination shows that they are probably relevant and valuable. It looks like most of MIRI\u2019s papers are purely self-published, but a few have been accepted to respected conferences (including <a href=\"http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai15.php\">AAAI-15</a>), although I don\u2019t know how high a bar this is. This is another of MIRI\u2019s weak points\u2013there\u2019s not clear evidence that other AI researchers respect its publications. MIRI papers are rarely cited by anyone other than MIRI itself and I would feel more confident about MIRI if it received more citations. This not a strong negative signal because AI safety is such a small field, but it\u2019s certainly not a positive signal either.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Influence\">Influence</h4>\n<p>Nate has <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2015/07/16/an-astounding-year/\">discussed</a> the fact that AI researchers appear more concerned about safety than they used to be, although it is unclear whether MIRI has had any causal role in bringing this about. Alyssa Vance <a href=\"http://rationalconspiracy.com/2014/10/06/academic-support-for-miri/\">lists</a> a few prominent academics who are familiar or involved with MIRI\u2019s work. I would like to see this trend continue\u2013AI safety remains a small field, and few AI researchers work on safety full-time.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know much about this, but my understanding is that in the past year or so, FLI has done a good deal more than MIRI to generate academic interest in AI safety; but MIRI had done more in previous years, and FLI probably wouldn\u2019t exist (or at least wouldn\u2019t be concerned about AI) if it weren\u2019t for MIRI. This suggests that MIRI has done a reasonably good job in the past of raising concern for AI safety, which is a good sign for MIRI\u2019s competence. It certainly could have been much more successful\u2013MIRI has existed for over a decade and AI safety has only recently begun gaining momentum. The idea of AI safety sounds <em>prima facie</em> absurd, so I\u2019d expect it to be hard to convince people that it matters, but perhaps someone other than MIRI could still have done a better job raising concern. (Today FLI seems to be doing a better job, although this may largely come from the fact that MIRI is focusing less on advocacy and more on research.)</p>\n<h4 id=\"Endorsements\">Endorsements</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell\">Stuart Russell</a> has publicly endorsed the importance of AI safety work and serves as a <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/team/#advisors\">research advisor</a> to MIRI. The advisory board consists of professors and AI researchers. I don\u2019t know what sort of relationship the advisors have with MIRI or to what extent serving as an advisor acts as an implicit endorsement of MIRI\u2019s competence.</p>\n<p>From what I have seen, MIRI is fairly lacking in endorsements from respected AI researchers. I do not know how likely it would be to get endorsements if it were doing valuable work, so I don\u2019t know how concerning this is, but it certainly counts as evidence against MIRI\u2019s effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Nate has <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2015/08/14/what-sets-miri-apart/\">claimed</a> that when he discusses the problems MIRI is working on with AI researchers, they agree that the problems are important:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I talk to industry folks fairly regularly about what they\u2019re working on and about what we\u2019re working on. Over and over, the reaction I get to our work is something along the lines of \u201cAh, yes, those are very important questions. We aren\u2019t working on those, but it does seem like we\u2019re missing some useful tools there. Let us know if you find some answers.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Or, just as often, the response we get is some version of \u201cWell, yes, that tool would be awesome, but getting it sounds impossible,\u201d or \u201cWait, why do you think we actually need that tool?\u201d Regardless, the conversations I\u2019ve had tend to end the same way for all three groups: \u201cThat would be a useful tool if you can develop it; we aren\u2019t working on that; let us know if you find some answers.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given that Nate is obviously motivated to believe that AI researchers value the work he\u2019s doing, he could be cherry-picking or misinterpreting people\u2019s claims here (I doubt he would do this deliberately but he may do it subconsciously or accidentally). It\u2019s also possible that people exaggerate how important they believe his research is for the sake of politeness. He does not provide any specific quotes or name any researchers who endorse MIRI\u2019s work as important, so I do not consider his claims here to be strong evidence.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Transparency\">Transparency</h4>\n<p>MIRI makes some effort to make itself more transparent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It publishes monthly newsletters that describe its research and activities</li>\n<li>It writes annual reviews</li>\n<li>It occasionally writes up explanations of its papers on the MIRI <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/blog/\">blog</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As far as I know, it was not doing any of these things three years ago, so this shows promise.</p>\n<p>Even better, it has a <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/research-guide/\">detailed guide</a> to what technical problems MIRI is researching and a <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf\">technical agenda</a> explaining why it works on the problems it does. These materials were published relatively recently, so MIRI is increasing transparency.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Concern_for_Animals\">Concern for Animals</h4>\n<p>Strictly speaking, this doesn\u2019t have anything to do with MIRI\u2019s skill at AI safety work, but one of my major concerns with friendly AI research is that it could lead to the development of an AI that benefits humans at the expense of non-human animals. In <a href=\"http://mdickens.me/2015/08/15/is_preventing_human_extinction_good/\">a separate essay</a>, I come to the conclusion that GCR reduction is probably valuable even considering its impact on non-human animals. Even so, I feel better about people doing AI safety research if they care about animals and are therefore motivated to do research that will not end up harming animals.</p>\n<p>I am somewhat more optimistic because Nate Soares, the current director of MIRI, appears to place high value on non-human animals; I have spoken with him about this issue, and he agrees it would be bad if an AI did not respect the interests of non-human animals and that it\u2019s a genuine concern. I briefly investigated the positions of most of the other full-time MIRI employees. From what I can glean from public information, it looks like <a href=\"http://nothingismere.com/2014/11/12/inhuman-altruism-inferential-gap-or-motivational-gap/\">Rob Bensinger</a> places adequate value on non-human animals and has a good understanding of why it\u2019s silly to not be vegetarian. Patrick LaVictoire apparently cares about animals, and <a href=\"https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2014/11/21/when-should-an-effective-altruist-be-vegetarian/\">Katja Grace</a> talks as though she cares about animals but I find her arguments against vegetarianism concerning<sup><a href=\"#fn:3\">2</a></sup> (Rob Bensinger has <a href=\"http://nothingismere.com/2015/09/10/revenge-of-the-meat-people/\">counterarguments</a>). Eliezer Yudkowsky doesn\u2019t believe animals are morally relevant at all. I don\u2019t know about the rest of MIRI\u2019s staff.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Room_for_More_Funding\">Room for More Funding</h3>\n<p>Based on MIRI\u2019s <a href=\"/ea/ln/2015_miri_summer_fundraiser_how_we_could_scale/\">fundraising goals</a> and current funds raised, I expect that it has substantial room for more funding. It has laid out a fairly coherent plan for how it could use additional funds, and Nate believes it could effectively use up to $6 million. Although I am less confident about its ability to usefully deploy an additional $6 million than an additional, say, $1 million, it is unlikely to raise that much in the near future; I expect it to continue to have a substantial funding gap.</p>\n<p>AI safety is attracting considerably more attention: Elon Musk has donated $10 million, and other donors or grantmakers may put more money into the field. This is still fairly uncertain, and I don\u2019t want to count on it happening; plus, I expect MIRI to have a better idea of which problems matter than most AI researchers or grantmakers (MIRI researchers have been working full-time on AI safety for a while), so funding MIRI probably matters more than funding AI safety research in general.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m concerned that FLI did not make larger grants to MIRI; this reflects negatively on MIRI\u2019s potential room for funding. I suspect FLI is being too conservative about making grants, but they have more information than I do, so it\u2019s hard to say. This is one of my primary concerns with MIRI. I\u2019ve tried to find out more information about FLI\u2019s decision, here but their grantmaking process involved confidential information so there\u2019s a limit to what I can learn.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Future_for_Humanity_Institute__FHI__and_Centre_for_the_Study_of_Existential_Risk__CSER_\">Future for Humanity Institute (FHI) and Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER)</h2>\n<p>Both of these organizations are potentially high value, but representatives of both organizations have claimed that they are not currently funding constrained.</p>\n<p>Neil Bowerman from FHI:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I would argue that FHI is not currently funding constrained\u2026.We could of course still use money productively to hire a communications/events person, more researchers and to extend our runway, however at present I would suggest that funding x-risk-oriented movement building, for example through Kerry Vaughan and Daniel Dewey\u2019s new projects, is a better use of funds than donating to FHI for EA-aligned funding. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/robert.wiblin/posts/694592875195?comment_id=694597964995&amp;reply_comment_id=694636113545&amp;total_comments=25\">source</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sean O hEigeartaigh from CSER:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We\u2019re not funding constrained in the large at the moment, having had success in several grants. We have good funding for postdoc positions and workshops for our initial projects. Most of our funding has some funder constraints, and so we may need small scale funding over the coming months for \u2018centre\u2019 costs that fall between the cracks, depending on what our current funders agree for their funds to cover \u2013 one example is an academic project manager position to aid my work. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/robert.wiblin/posts/694592875195?comment_id=694597964995&amp;reply_comment_id=694639920915&amp;total_comments=25\">source</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Both of these people posted comments on a Facebook thread after Eliezer said these organizations were funding-constrained. Apparently a good way to find information about an organization is to make public, incorrect claims about it.</p>\n<p>Edited 2015-09-21 to add: The fact that these organizations claim they don\u2019t have room for more funding makes me more confident that they\u2019re optimizing for actually reducing existential risk rather than optimizing for personal success. If one of them does become substantially funding-constrained in the near future, I consider it fairly likely that it will be the best giving opportunity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Future_of_Life_Institute\">Future of Life Institute</h2>\n<p>FLI organized the \u201cFuture of AI\u201d conference on AI safety and funded AI research projects that cover a somewhat broader range than MIRI\u2019s research does. It has future plans to expand into biosecurity work but at the time of this writing it has not gotten beyond the early stages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Size_of_Impact1\">Size of Impact</h3>\n<p>I expect the median FLI grant to be less effective than the same amount of money given to MIRI, but due to its breadth it may hit upon a small number of extremely effective grants that end up making a large difference. That said, the broader approach of FLI looks more reasonable to fund for someone who doesn\u2019t have strong confidence that MIRI is effective at reducing AI risk.</p>\n<p>Some of FLI\u2019s AI grants are probably highly effective. However, I find some of them concerning. Some of <a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/AI/2015awardees\">the research projects</a> attempt to make progress on inferring human values. If the inferred human values are harmful (more specifically, they do not assign sufficient value to non-human animals or other sorts of non-human minds), the AI could produce very bad outcomes such as filling the universe with wild-animal suffering. I think this is <a href=\"http://mdickens.me/2015/08/15/is_preventing_human_extinction_good/\">more likely not to happen than to happen</a>, but it\u2019s a substantial concern, and it\u2019s an argument in favor of spreading good values to ensure that if AI researchers create a superintelligent AI, they give it good values.</p>\n<p>I do not have the same concern with MIRI: I have spoken to Nate Soares about this issue, and he agrees that encoding human values (as they currently exist) in an AI would be a bad idea, in part because it might give insufficient weight to non-human animals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Room_for_More_Funding1\">Room for More Funding</h3>\n<p>FLI recently <a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/AI/AI_beneficial\">received $10 million</a> from Elon Musk and an additional <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/ai-risk/FutureOfLifeRFP\">$1 million from the Open Philanthropy Project</a>. From Open Phil\u2019s writeup:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After working closely with FLI during the receipt and evaluation of proposals, we determined that the value of high quality project proposals submitted was greater than the available funding. Consequently, we made a grant of $1,186,000 to FLI to enable additional project proposals to be funded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It sounds like Open Phil gave FLI exactly as much money as it believed it needed to fund the most promising research proposals. This makes me believe that FLI has no room for more funding. Even if FLI had wanted to fund more grants, I don\u2019t believe I could actually allow them to do so.</p>\n<p>Suppose FLI has $X and would like to have $(X+A+B+C). Open Phil believes FLI should have $(X+A+B). If I do nothing, Open Phil will give $(A+B) to FLI. If I give $A to FLI, Open Phil will give $B, so either way FLI ends up with $(X+A+B). I cannot give money to FLI <em>after</em> Open Phil does be causes FLI will have finished making grants by then. I believe this model approximately describes the situation during the previous round of grantmaking and probably describes future rounds; so my donations only serve to reduce the amount of money that Open Phil gives to FLI.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Open_Phil_Recommended_GCR_Charities\">Open Phil-Recommended GCR Charities</h2>\n<p>At the time of this writing, Open Phil has not produced any recommendations on GCR interventions that small donors can viably support, and probably won\u2019t for a while. In fact, it\u2019s not even clear that it has any plans to do so. I looked through Open Phil\u2019s published materials and could not find anything on this.</p>\n<p><em>(Edited 2015-09-16 to clarify.)</em></p>\n<p>But if Open Phil does produce recommendations for small donors, it\u2019s likely that one or some of these recommendations will represent better giving opportunities than any existing GCR charity that I could identify on my own.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Size_of_Impact2\">Size of Impact</h3>\n<p>GCRs have possibly the largest impact of any cause area; the case for this has been made before and does not need to be repeated here. Presumably, Open Phil recommendations will have as large an impact as any other organizations working in the GCR space, although it\u2019s fairly likely that Open Phil will not find any organizations that have a higher impact than organizations like MIRI or FHI that are well known in EA circles.</p>\n<p>Waiting for Open Phil means losing out on any value that could be generated between now and then, including both direct effects and learning value. The haste consideration weighs heavily in favor of supporting organizations now rather than waiting for Open Phil.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Strength_of_Evidence2\">Strength of Evidence</h3>\n<p>I expect strength of evidence to be the main benefit of Open Phil-recommended organizations over current organizations. Although Open Phil focuses on more speculative causes than GiveWell classic, it still does extensive research into cause areas, and I would expect it to recommend specific interventions if it has strong reason to believe that they are effective. Right now, the organizations working on GCR reduction have only weak evidence of impact, and Open Phil will likely change this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Room_for_More_Funding2\">Room for More Funding</h3>\n<p>Although Open Phil-recommended GCR organizations may be the best giving opportunities in the world, I have major concerns about their neglectedness. Right now Good Ventures has more money than it knows how to move, and it could fill the room for more funding for all of Open Phil\u2019s recommendations on GCR reduction. If I donate to GCR, it may only displace donations by Good Ventures. I see this as a major argument against waiting for Open Phil recommendations. It\u2019s possible that Open Phil will find massively scalable opportunities in this space, but it does not seem likely that it will find anything so scalable that it can absorb any funds Good Ventures directs at it and still have more room for more funding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"GiveWell_Open_Philanthropy_Project\">GiveWell/Open Philanthropy Project</h2>\n<p><em>(Here I use GiveWell to refer to both classic GiveWell and Open Phil.)</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"Size_of_Impact3\">Size of Impact</h3>\n<p><em>(Edited 2015-09-16 to expand on my reasoning.)</em></p>\n<p>I consider it likely that Open Phil\u2019s work on GCRs will find interventions that are more effective than anything EAs are currently doing. But it seems rather unlikely that their other current focus areas (except possibly factory farming) will produce anything as effective. Over the next 5-10 years the existing institutions working on GCR reduction may run out of room for more funding as the EA movement grows and/or GCR reduction efforts attract more interest, in which case Open Phil-type work of seeking out new interventions would be especially valuable; but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet. It\u2019s also unclear to what extent GiveWell can use additional funds from small donors to produce recommendations more quickly.</p>\n<p>If I believe that GCR interventions are much more effective in expectation than most other sorts of interventions (which I do), then Open Phil\u2019s effectiveness gets diluted whenever it works on anything other than GCR reduction. I understand that Open Phil/Good Ventures want to fund a broader range of interventions, and that may make sense for someone with as much money as Good Ventures; but if I believe they are leaving funding gaps in GCR interventions then I can probably have a bigger impact by funding those interventions directly rather than by supporting Open Phil.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Strength_of_Evidence3\">Strength of Evidence</h3>\n<p>GiveWell appears to apply much more rigor and clear thinking to charity analysis than anyone else. I trust its judgment more than my own in many cases. I am concerned that it does not place sufficient attention on sentient beings other than humans. Open Phil recently committed $5 million to factory farming, which I find promising but ultimately much too limited. Good Ventures recently committed to a $25 million grant to GiveDirectly; it\u2019s plausible that the factory farming grant will do perhaps two or three orders of magnitude more good per dollar than the GiveDirectly grant and should be receiving a lot more money. If GiveWell as an organization shared my values about the importance of animals, I might be more likely to support it, but their current spending patterns make me reluctant.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Room_for_More_Funding3\">Room for More Funding</h3>\n<p><em>(Edited 2015-09-16 to clarify.)</em></p>\n<p>Good Ventures currently pays for a large portion of GiveWell\u2019s operating expenses, and GW has no apparent need for funding. It wants to maintain independence from Good Ventures by keeping other sources of funding, but I do not find this consideration very important. If Good Ventures stops backing them and GiveWell finds itself in need of funding, I will reconsider donating.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know how much influence Good Ventures has over GiveWell\u2019s activities. I\u2019m considerably less confident in Good Ventures\u2019 cause prioritization skills than GiveWell\u2019s, so I prefer that GiveWell has primary control over Open Phil\u2019s cause selection, although I don\u2019t know how much this matters. I wish GiveWell were more transparent about this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Animal_Charity_Evaluators__ACE_\">Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE)</h2>\n<p><em>Emotional disclosure: I feel a strong positive affect surrounding ACE, so I may end up overrating its value. The thought of giving money to ACE makes me feel like I\u2019m making a big difference on an emotional level, and this feeling probably biases me in ACE\u2019s favor.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"Size_of_Impact4\">Size of Impact</h3>\n<p>ACE has three plausible routes to impact that I can see.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It could discover new effective interventions.</li>\n<li>It could produce stronger evidence for known interventions and thus persuade more donors to direct money there.</li>\n<li>It could produce strong evidence that known interventions are ineffective and thus direct money elsewhere.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>On #1: I expect there are highly effective methods of helping animals that are not yet tractable or even well-understood, such as environmental interventions to reduce wild-animal suffering. ACE <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/foundational-research/wild-animal-suffering/\">cares about wild-animal suffering</a> and would likely do research on under-examined and potentially high-impact topics such as this if it had a lot more funding. It\u2019s unlikely that my funding would push ACE over the edge to where it decides to invest more in research of this sort; but it cannot do this research unless it has more funding, and it cannot get more funding unless people like me provide it. ACE is also small enough that if I requested that it do more research in some area, it would probably be willing to entertain the possibility.</p>\n<p>On #2: I have met several people who do not donate to animal charities solely because they think the evidence for them is too weak. If ACE produced higher-quality research supporting animal charities, this would almost certainly persuade some people to donate to them; but I don\u2019t know how much money would be directed this way.</p>\n<p>On #3: If ACE discovers that popular interventions are much less effective than previous evidence showed, to the point where GW top charities look more effective and more donors start giving to GW charities instead, the maximum impact here would be the impact had by marginal donations to GW top charities. This is a much smaller impact than the plausible impact of effective animal charities. Certainly if current interventions are ineffective then we want to know, but discovering this is much less valuable than discovering that some factory farming intervention is definitively 10x more impactful than a GW top charity. Changing impact from 0x to 1x is much less important than changing from 1x to 10x.</p>\n<p><em>Edited 2015-09-16 to add</em>: ACE may find that some types of interventions are ineffective while others are effective and thus direct funding to the more effective interventions. This would be about as valuable as #2, and possibly more effective because this sort of evidence might be able to move more money. Thanks to <a href=\"/ea/ns/my_cause_selection_michael_dickens/50c\">Carl Shulman</a> for raising this possibility.</p>\n<p>It is unclear how to reason about the probability of #1 and #3 or the effect size of #1 and #2, so I do not know much about the expected impact of each. Number 1 certainly has the highest upside and makes me the most optimistic about the value of donations to ACE. I would like to see rigorous work on interventions to help animals on a massive scale (such as wild animals or animals in the far future). Right now, we\u2019re nowhere close to being able to produce this sort of work, but the best way I can see to push us in that direction is to support ACE.</p>\n<p>As I explain in <a href=\"http://mdickens.me/2015/08/15/is_preventing_human_extinction_good/\">\u201cIs Preventing Human Extinction Good?\u201d</a>, I see good reason to be optimistic about the long-term impact of humanity on all sentient life. In the words of Carl Sagan, \u201cIf we do not destroy ourselves, we will one day venture to the stars\u201d (and biologically engineer animals to be happy). Thus it looks like ensuring humanity continues to survive is more important than reducing wild-animal suffering in the medium-term future.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s possible that spreading concern for wild animals will have a massive effect on the far future; but it\u2019s not at all clear that ACE research will ever have this effect, even if it does research on reducing wild animal suffering. I discuss my general concerns with values spreading in <a href=\"http://mdickens.me/2015/09/10/on_values_spreading/\">\u201cOn Values Spreading\u201d</a>. Even so, I believe ACE has a decent chance of being the most effective charity. It\u2019s not too unlikely that if ACE had substantially more funding, it would find an intervention or interventions that are more effective than anything that currently receives funding. This makes supporting ACE look like a promising option.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Strength_of_Evidence4\">Strength of Evidence</h3>\n<p>ACE does not have as strong a reputation as GiveWell, although it is a much newer and smaller organization so this is to be expected. The interactions I have had with employees and volunteers at ACE have left me with a strong positive impression of their competence and concern for the problems they are attempting to solve. Their research results have not been nearly as in-depth as GiveWell\u2019s, but ACE acknowledges this. This is largely a product of the lack of studies that have been done on animal advocacy. ACE is making some efforts to improve the state of research, and these efforts look promising. I spoke to Eric Herboso<sup><a href=\"#fn:4\">3</a></sup> about this, and he had clearly put some thought into how ACE can improve the state of research.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Room_for_More_Funding4\">Room for More Funding</h3>\n<p>ACE appears to have strong ability to absorb more funding. Right now it has a budget of only about $150,000 a year\u2013not nearly enough to do the sort of large randomized controlled trials that it wants. I expect ACE could expand its budget several-fold without having much diminishing marginal effectiveness. Additionally, if it expanded, it could broaden its scope, putting more effort into researching wild animal suffering or other speculative but potentially high-impact causes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Learning_Value\">Learning Value</h3>\n<p>ACE does research and publicly publishes its results, so I believe donations to ACE have particularly high learning value. Peter Hurford has <a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/where-ive-changed-my-mind-on-my-approach-to-speculative-causes/\">argued</a> \u201cwhen you\u2019re in a position of high uncertainty, the best response is to use a strategy of exploration rather than a strategy of exploitation.\u201d I expect donations to ACE to produce more valuable knowledge than donations almost anywhere else, which makes me optimistic about the value of donations to ACE. In particular, I expect ACE to produce substantially more valuable research per dollar spent than GiveWell.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Animal_Ethics__AE__and_Foundational_Research_Institute__FRI_\">Animal Ethics (AE) and Foundational Research Institute (FRI)</h2>\n<p>Both these organizations do high-level research and values spreading for fairly unconventional but important values like concern for wild animals. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one of these turned out to be the best place to donate, but I don\u2019t know much about their activities or room for more funding and I\u2019ve had difficulty finding information. The only thing I can see them publicly doing is publishing essays. While I find these essays valuable to read, I don\u2019t have a good picture of how much good this actually does.</p>\n<p>A note to these organizations: if you were more transparent about how you use donor funds, I would more seriously consider donating.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Giving_What_We_Can__GWWC_\">Giving What We Can (GWWC)</h2>\n<p>I\u2019m skeptical about the value of creating new EAs because <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/sites/effectivealtruismhub.com/files/survey/2014/results-and-analysis.pdf\">the 2014 EA survey</a> showed that the average donation size was rather small. However, Giving What We Can members are probably substantially better than generic self-identified EAs because GWWC carefully tracks members\u2019 donations. I can\u2019t find any more recent data, but <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-10-24/six-month-retrospective-progress-review\">from 2013</a> it looks like members have a fairly strong track record of keeping the pledge.</p>\n<p>At present, only a tiny fraction of <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/members\">GWWC members\u2019 donations</a> go toward GCR-reduction or animal-focused organizations, which may be much higher value than global poverty charities. Based on GWWC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/members\">public data</a>, it has directed $92,000 to far-future charities so far (and apparently $0 to animal charities, which I find surprising). If we extrapolate from GWWC\u2019s (speculative) <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/impact\">expected future donations</a>, current members will direct about $287,000 to far-future charities. That\u2019s less than GWWC\u2019s total costs of $443,000, but the additional donations to global poverty charities may make up for this. But I\u2019m skeptical if GWWC will have as large a future impact as it expects to have (a 60:1 fundraising ratio seems implausibly high), and it\u2019s not clear how many of its donations would have happened anyway. I know a number of people who signed the GWWC pledge but would have donated just as much if they hadn\u2019t. (I don\u2019t know how common this is in general.) Additionally, I don\u2019t see a clear picture of how donations to GWWC translates into new members. GWWC might raise more money than Charity Science or Raising for Effective Giving (both discussed below), but I have a lot more uncertainty about it which makes me more skeptical.</p>\n<p>These various factors make me inclined to believe that directly supporting GCR reduction or high-learning-value organizations will have greater impact that supporting GWWC.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Charity_Science\">Charity Science</h2>\n<p>Charity Science has successfully raised money for GiveWell top charities (it <a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/organizational-breakdown.htm\">claims</a> to have raised $9 for every $1 spent) through a variety of fundraising strategies. It has helped individuals run Christmas fundraisers and created a <a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/shop-for-charity.html\">Shop for Charity</a> browser extension that allows you to donate 5% of your Amazon purchases at no cost to you. It has plans to explore other methods of fundraising such as applying the <a href=\"#raising-for-effective-giving-reg\">REG</a> model to other niches and convincing people to put charities in their wills.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Size_of_Impact5\">Size of Impact</h3>\n<p>Right now Charity Science focuses on raising money for GiveWell top charities. Its fundraising model looks promising\u2013it tries a lot of different fundraising methods, so I think it\u2019s likely to find effective ones\u2013but I expect that the best charities are substantially higher-impact than GiveWell top charities, so this leads me to believe that donations to Charity Science are not as impactful as donations to highly effective far-future-oriented charities. I spoke with Joey Savoie, and he has considered doing research on effective interventions to help non-human animals. This is promising, and I may donate to Charity Science in the future if it ever focuses on this, but for now its activities look less valuable than ACE or REG (see below).</p>\n<p><em>Edited 2015-09-16 to add:</em> Carl Shulman <a href=\"/ea/ns/my_cause_selection_michael_dickens/50c\">points out</a> that Charity Science\u2019s 9:1 fundraising ratio substantially undervalues the opportunity cost of staff time, so the effective fundraising ratio is less than this. This looks like a bigger problem for Charity Science than for the other fundraising charities I consider.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Room_for_More_Funding5\">Room for More Funding</h3>\n<p>Based on Charity Science\u2019s August 2015 <a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/operations-details\">monthly report</a>, it looks like it could use new funding to scale up and broaden its activities. It has enough ideas about activities to pursue that I believe it could deploy substantially more funds without experiencing much diminishing marginal utility.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Learning_Value1\">Learning Value</h3>\n<p>Donations to Charity Science will likely have high value in terms of learning how to effectively raise funds. I\u2019m uncertain about how valuable this is; I feel more confident about the value of learning about object-level interventions and I\u2019m somewhat wary of movement growth as a cause, largely for reasons Peter Hurford discusses <a href=\"/ea/my/ea_risks_falling_into_a_meta_trap_but_we_can/\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Raising_for_Effective_Giving__REG_\">Raising for Effective Giving (REG)</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Size_of_Impact6\">Size of Impact</h3>\n<p>In 2014, REG had a fundraising ratio of 10:1, about the same as Charity Science\u2019s. I am somewhat more optimistic about the value of REG\u2019s fundraising than Charity Science\u2019s because REG has successfully raised money for far future and animal charities in addition to GiveWell recommendations. For details, see REG\u2019s <a href=\"http://reg-charity.org/about/transparency/\">quarterly transparency reports</a>. In the conclusion, I look at REG\u2019s fundraising in more detail (including how much it raises for far future and animal charities) to try to assess how much value it has.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Strength_of_Evidence5\">Strength of Evidence</h3>\n<p><em>Edited 2015-09-21.</em></p>\n<p>The case for REG\u2019s effectiveness appears pretty straightforward: it has successfully persuaded lots of poker players to donate money to good causes. Along with other movement-building charities, REG faces a concern about counterfactuals: how many of REG-attributed donations would have happened anyway? I believe this is a serious concern for Giving What We Can\u2013many people who signed the pledge would have donated the same amount anyway (I\u2019m in this category, as are many of my friends).</p>\n<p>REG\u2019s case here looks much better than the other EA movement-building charities I\u2019ve considered. REG focuses its outreach on poker players who were previously uninvolved in EA for the most part. Even if they were going to donate substantial sums prior to joining REG, they almost certainly would have given to much less effective charities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Room_for_More_Funding6\">Room for More Funding</h3>\n<p>REG is small and has considerable room to expand. They have specific ideas about things they would like to do but can\u2019t because they don\u2019t have enough money. I expect REG could effectively make use of an additional $100,000 per year and perhaps considerably more than that. This is not a lot of room for more funding (GiveWell moves millions of dollars per year to each of its top charities), but it\u2019s enough that I expect REG could effectively use donations from me and probably from anyone else who might decide to donate to them as a result of reading this.</p>\n<p>REG receives funding through the Effective Altruism Foundation (EAF), but <del>you can donate through REG\u2019s <a href=\"http://reg-charity.org/donate/\">donations page</a> and the funds are earmarked for REG</del> you can <a href=\"http://gbs-switzerland.org/support/donate/\">donate to EAF</a> (formerly known as GBS Switzerland) and earmark your donations for REG.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Learning_Value2\">Learning Value</h3>\n<p><em>Added 2015-09-17.</em></p>\n<p>REG looks less exploratory than Charity Science so it probably has worse learning value, but it\u2019s still pursuing an unusual fundraising model with a lot of potential to expand (especially into other niches).

I created two different sets of weightings: one where I assume AI safety is the most impactful intervention (with MIRI as the most effective charity) and one where I assume animal welfare/values spreading is highest leverage (with ACE as the most effective charity). The AI model reflects my current best guesses, but I created the animal model to see what sorts of results I would get.</p>\n<p>This table shows how much money REG raised in each category over its four quarters of existence to date (in thousands of dollars), taken from its lovely <a href=\"http://reg-charity.org/about/transparency/\">transparency reports</a>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead> \n<tr>\n<th>Name</th> <th>2014Q3</th> <th>2014Q4</th> <th>2015Q1</th> <th>2015Q2</th> <th>Total</th>\n</tr>\n</thead> \n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>GBS</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>126</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>178</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ACE</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>animal (veg)</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>speculative</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>45</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MIRI</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>53</td>\n<td>53</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>93</td>\n<td>53</td>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>216</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>369</td>\n<td>57</td>\n<td>153</td>\n<td>617</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I used these fundraising numbers and assumed REG\u2019s expenses through 2015Q2 are $100,000, extrapolating from <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wami5x9PN5rNswueEZHrspL4n0jX6vRMFh0y3wqZoD8/edit#gid=783872954\">2014\u2019s expenses</a> of $52,318.</p>\n<p>For my two models I used the following weights:</p>\n<table>\n<thead> \n<tr>\n<th>Category</th> <th>AI-Model Weight</th> <th>Animal-Model Weight</th>\n</tr>\n</thead> \n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>GBS</td>\n<td>0.2</td>\n<td>0.2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ACE</td>\n<td>0.5</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>veg advocacy</td>\n<td>0.2</td>\n<td>0.3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>speculative</td>\n<td>0.3</td>\n<td>0.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MIRI</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0.2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other</td>\n<td>0.1</td>\n<td>0.1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<ul>\n<li>Veg advocacy includes charities that promote vegetarianism and meat reduction. All charities in this category were ACE recommendations or ACE standout charities.</li>\n<li>Speculative includes unconventional organizations that share my concern for non-human animals, including Animal Ethics and the Nonhuman Rights Project.</li>\n<li>Other includes everything else; most of this money went to GiveWell top charities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For GBS, I conservatively assume that all money directed toward GBS goes to activities other than REG (and I give these activities a weight of 0.2). Accounting for GBS funding going back to REG involves some complications so to be conservative I ignore any compounding effects that occur this way.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not unlikely that categories in this model vary much more in effectiveness than the weights I have listed here. I decided to keep all the weights relatively close together because I do not have strong confidence about how much good each of these categories do. I might be able to make an inside-view argument that, say, MIRI is 1000x more effective than anything else on this list, but from the outside view, I shouldn\u2019t let such an argument <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/06/10/sequence-thinking-vs-cluster-thinking/\">carry too much weight</a>.</p>\n<p>In the AI/MIRI model, I found that $10 of REG expenditures produced about $16 of weighted donations; in the ACE/animal model, every $10 spent produced $15 of weighted donations. This means that $10 to REG produced about $16 in equivalent donations to MIRI in the first model, and $15 in equivalent donations to ACE in the second model.<sup><a href=\"#fn:5\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>When we weight the charities that REG has produced donations for, its fundraising ratio drops from 10:1 to a much more modest 1.5:1. Donating to REG instead of directly to an object-level charity produces an additional level of complexity, which means my money has more opportunities to fail to do good. A 1.5:1 fundraising ratio is probably high enough to outweigh my uncertainty about REG\u2019s impact, but not by a wide margin.</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s another argument working in REG\u2019s favor. I have considerable uncertainty about whether it\u2019s more important to support values spreading-type interventions like what ACE or Animal Ethics does, or to support GCR reduction like MIRI. GCR reduction looks a little more important, but it\u2019s a tough question. The fact that REG produces a greater-than-one multiplier using both a MIRI-dominated model and an ACE-dominated model means that if I donate to REG, I produce a positive multiplier either way. If I choose to donate to either MIRI or ACE, I could get it wrong; but if I donate to REG, in some sense I\u2019m guaranteed to \u201cget it right\u201d because donations to REG probably produce greater than $1 in both MIRI-equivalent and ACE-equivalent donations.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t want to put too much value on this fundraising ratio because there are various reasons why it could be off by a lot. It appears to show that REG fundraising is valuable even if you discount most of the charities it raises money for, which was my main intention. This alone is not sufficient to demonstrate REG\u2019s effectiveness to my mind, but its leadership looks competent and its model has reasonably strong learning value.</p>\n<p>A caveat: just because REG has raised a lot of funds for MIRI and animal charities in the past doesn\u2019t mean it will continue to do so. But it raised these funds from a number of different people and over multiple quarters, so this is good reason to believe that it will continue to find donors interested in supporting MIRI and ACE/animal charities. Additionally, Ruairi Donnelly, REG\u2019s Executive Director, has said to me in private communication that REG is meeting with more donors who want to fund far-future oriented work and that he hopes REG will move more money to these causes in the future.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a concern about whether REG will continue to raise as much money per dollar spent as it has in the past. I expect REG to experience diminishing returns, although it is a new and very small organization so returns should not diminish much in the near future. I don\u2019t have a strong sense for the size of the market of poker players who might be interested in donating to effective causes. It looks considerably bigger than REG\u2019s current capacity so REG has some room to scale up, but I don\u2019t know how long this will continue to be true. If REG\u2019s fundraising ratio dropped to 5:1 and it didn\u2019t increase funding to far-future charities, I would probably not donate to it; but it seems unlikely that it will drop that much in the near future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Decision\">Decision</h2>\n<p><em>Edited 2015-09-24. I had previously written that I didn\u2019t know if I was going to donate this year.</em></p>\n<p>Based on all these considerations, it looks like Raising for Effective Giving is the best charity to fund. My main concern here is falling into a <a href=\"/ea/my/ea_risks_falling_into_a_meta_trap_but_we_can/\">meta trap</a>. One possible solution here is to split donations 50/50 between meta- and object-level organizations. If I were to do this, I would give 50% to REG and 50% to MIRI. But I believe the EA movement could afford to be more meta-focused right now, so I feel comfortable giving 100% of my donations to REG.</p>\n<p>I plan on directing my entire donation budget this year to <a href=\"http://reg-charity.org/donate/\">REG</a>.

I almost immediately resolved to stop eating meat and donate some of my income to effective non-profits in the third world.</p>\n<p>When I was first going through the phase where I was excited about atheism, one of the topics most frequently on my mind was how to find purpose without a god to look up to. \u00a0I found humanism as a temporary answer to this question, but I wasn't satisfied until I found effective altruism. \u00a0I finally had a chance to make a meaningful impact in the world, which is what I always wanted.</p>\n<p>Over the summer of 2012, I got involved in <a href=\"http://www.felicifia.org\">Felicifia</a>, a utilitarian forum, and spoke to many of the people there. \u00a0Around the same time, I joined <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org\">Giving What We Can</a> a little later, and pledged to donate 10% of my income.</p>\n<p>I continued to blog, but shifted my topics immediately to that of effective altruism.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Eventually, in the winter of 2012, I summoned the courage to post some of my EA writing to LessWrong. \u00a0There, it was noticed by Michelle Hutchinson, who graciously invited me to write for the Giving What We Can blog. \u00a0I enjoyed this, and built a relationship with the people there.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I heard that Giving What We Can was offering internships. \u00a0I already had an internship lined up at the time, but I immediately (and politely) dashed it for the chance to spend a summer in Oxford working for Giving What We Can full-time for Summer 2013.</p>\n<p>I met many amazing people there and had many amazing discussions. \u00a0While working there, I also met Joey, Xio, and Tom, who became some of my best friends and I've enjoyed being able to collaborate with them on Charity Science.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>After Giving What We Can, I went back to college to finish my last year, sad that I couldn't stay longer in Oxford.</p>\n<p>Throughout college, I had been studying political science. \u00a0Prior to being exposed to EA, I was really excited about becoming a political science professor someday. \u00a0After being exposed to EA, I thought about ways through which being a professor could make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>Sometime in Spring 2013, I had a Skype with Will Macaskill. \u00a0I told him about my plan to make the world a better place through political science. \u00a0He was very polite, but skeptical. \u00a0I suddenly realized that my plan had to change.</p>\n<p>While working for Giving What We Can, I undertook a personal career search and had a few career advising sessions with 80,000 Hours. \u00a0I finally narrowed things down to five potential careers. \u00a0I posted about this <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hr4/initial_thoughts_on_personally_finding_a/\">on LessWrong</a>.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>A few days into posting about my careers on LessWrong, a user there -- who was a total stranger to me at the time -- reached out and offered to talk to me about one of the jobs I indicated, which was computer programming. \u00a0His name was Rob. \u00a0That initial reach out then solidified into dedicated programming tutoring, for free.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I learned that the company Rob worked for was looking for interns. \u00a0Rob encouraged me to apply and offered to submit my resume internally. \u00a0Three interviews over the next three weeks and I had the internship. \u00a0The internal referral came from an EA and the skills I needed to get through the interview were due to coaching by an EA. \u00a0In fact, my entire inspiration for looking for a career in computer programming was due to the EAs I already knew in the field telling me it was promising.</p>\n<p>I enjoy my job. \u00a0I'm working now as a data scientist, and the work environment is fun, the problems are challenging, and I like my co-workers. \u00a0If I didn't know any EAs, I'd probably be in graduate school right now, and I think that would be a lot less fun.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Thanks to the EA network, I've had an incredible opportunity to do good in ways I never thought were possible. \u00a0But I've had more than that. \u00a0I've made great friendships. \u00a0I got my first career, and a network to help me find dozens more jobs if I ever need them. \u00a0I have a support network for guidance.</p>\n<p>I've lost count of the number of times I've asked for help on something and received it because that person was an EA and I was an EA too. \u00a0It's been phenomenal to be a part of a network where we truly have the same goals, and helping out other people in the network is just as good as helping myself.</p>\n<p>I'm excited for the chance to be in the EA network. \u00a0I think it's been great for me, and I can't wait to see what comes next.</p></div></div>"},

I\u2019ve tried being vegan in the past, but I\u2019ve never managed to keep it up for more than a few months - I always end up slipping out of it when it becomes too inconvenient (or, to be honest, when I just really want some cheese...)</p>\n<p>I think there\u2019s a good chance I should be a vegan, given my values and beliefs, and I feel kind of uncomfortable about the fact that I eat dairy and eggs. But I\u2019ve never been totally convinced that the benefits of me being vegan are worth the cost to me - which, I think, is why I haven\u2019t quite been able to sustain it. I feel like I\u2019m stuck in this limbo where I\u2019m not certain enough that I should be vegan to just do it, but I\u2019m also not certain enough that I shouldn\u2019t do it to feel happy with my choice to eat animal products.</p>\n<p>So now I want to think this decision through more thoroughly - weigh all the different considerations, and make a considered decision one way or the other that I can be reasonably happy with. I thought I\u2019d post an overview of what I think are the main considerations here to get feedback from others who may have thought about this more than me, and also because it might be helpful for other people thinking about similar decisions to see my thought process.</p>\n<p>(This ended up pretty long. I tried to break it up into key sub-sections and summarise my main uncertainties at the end of each section so that it\u2019s fairly skim-able.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h1 id=\"Considerations_in_favour_of_being_vegan\">Considerations in favour of being vegan</h1>\n<h2 id=\"1__The_impact_of_my_diet_on_animal_suffering\"><strong>1. The impact of my diet on animal suffering</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>My main motivation for being vegan is that I care about animals, I believe they suffer, and I specifically believe that the way the meat/dairy/egg industry treats animals generally causes them to suffer a lot.</strong> I\u2019m assuming that most people here will broadly agree with me on these points, so I\u2019m not going to defend them here.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a question of how my personal consumption habits affect the industry - by eating eggs and milk, to what extent am I directly causing animals in farms to suffer? If I were to stop eating eggs and milk, would doing so cause fewer animals to suffer? This gets us into some slightly complicated questions about the elasticity of demand in the dairy and egg industries.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>According to\u00a0<a href=\"http://global.oup.com/academic/product/compassion-by-the-pound-9780199551163?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;\">Compassion By The Pound</a> ( <a href=\"http://asp.okstate.edu/baileynorwood/misc1/Mexico/Compassion%20by%20the%20Pound%20%28Final%29.pdf\">pd</a>), for every egg you eat, you increase egg production by 0.91 - demand for eggs is highly elastic, which basically just means that my consumption habits can have a large effect on others\u2019 consumption habits and broader production.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Demand for milk products is less elastic, but still significant - for every pound of milk you buy, you increase production by 0.56 pounds.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong id=\"So_for_every_egg_I_give_up__I_reduce_egg_production_by_0_91__and_for_every_pound_of_milk_I_give_up__I_reduce_milk_production_by_0_56_pounds_\">So for every egg I give up, I reduce egg production by 0.91, and for every pound of milk I give up, I reduce milk production by 0.56 pounds.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So it seems that whether I eat eggs and milk or not clearly has some effect on egg and dairy production. In order to understand this in terms of impact on animal welfare, though - which is what I really care about - we also need to understand how bad the quality of life for those cows and hens is.</p>\n<p><strong>At a certain point, we can approximately say that me buying fewer eggs will mean that one less chicken ends up having a horrible life on a factory farm</strong> (I don\u2019t have the exact figures on this - I\u2019ve heard that 2 eggs = 5 days for a hen on a factory farm - but would be interested if anyone has numbers &amp; good evidence on this to hand). But what\u2019s really crucial here - and what I think a lot of people don\u2019t get intuitively - is that the alternative to that chicken being on a factory farm isn\u2019t living a nice free life in some beautiful pastures. The alternative is that chicken not existing at all. When we farm animals for meat and for their dairy products, we bring animals into existence that would not have existed otherwise. Really, then, the important question isn\u2019t, \u201cAre these animals suffering?\u201d, but \u201cAre these animals suffering so much that they would be better off never having existed?\u201d. This is a much more difficult question to answer, and ultimately involves a subjective judgement (as well as some messy ethical issues when you really get down to it, about whether it\u2019s really a good thing to have millions of chickens exist whose lives are just barely worth living...)</p>\n<p>Bailey Norwood, author of Compassion By the Pound, thinks that dairy cows have fairly decent lives: on a scale from -10 to 10, he places them at a 4. Egg-laying hens he\u2019s a bit more uncertain about: in a cage-free system, he thinks hens lives are worth living (2 for a market animal, 3 for a breeder animal), but in a cage system, their lives may well be incredibly negative (-8 for a market animal, though still 3 for a breeder animal.) However, Brian Tomasik <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/comments-on-compassion-by-the-pound/\">thinks these numbers are far too optimistic</a> - especially for chickens - and that Norwood fails to account for the pain of slaughter and the length of their lives. <strong>It seems pretty likely to me that the lives of egg-laying hens in factory farms in the US are significantly negative, but I\u2019m not certain of this.</strong></p>\n<p>Adding to the uncertainty is the fact that most of the considerations Norwood and Tomasik give are based on US factory farming conditions. I\u2019m in the UK, and European regulations on the treatment of farm animals seem to be stricter, suggesting that they probably suffer less.</p>\n<p>My very tentative conclusion based on all of this is that from a purely consequentialist perspective, there\u2019s probably a pretty clear argument for me to give up eggs - because demand is fairly elastic and egg-laying hens probably have pretty bad lives. The consequentialist argument against eating dairy is much less convincing since it seems plausible that dairy cows have lives that are worth living (though I find it pretty hard to believe this when I hear emotive stories about calves being taken away from their mothers at birth...). Also, since one cow produces a large amount of milk, the number of cows that have to suffer to produce the small amount of dairy products I currently consume is probably pretty small - I haven\u2019t worked out the numbers on this, though.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Main_uncertainties_here_\">Main uncertainties here:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How bad are the lives of dairy cows and egg-laying hens in the EU - i.e. those that provide the milk &amp; eggs I\u2019m actually eating?</strong> If anyone has looked into this or knows of good sources of information I\u2019d really appreciate suggestions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"2___I_don_t_want_to_be_part_of_this_\"><strong>2. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of this\u201d</strong></h2>\n<p>Consequentialist considerations aren\u2019t the only thing motivating me. <strong>To be honest, a huge part of my motivation comes from a strong emotional sense of \u201cI don\u2019t like this, and I don\u2019t want to be part of it.\u201d</strong> The more I think and learn about the industry that produces my milk and eggs, the more uncomfortable and upset I feel about it, and the more I feel that I want to completely disassociate myself from it.</p>\n<p>I know this isn\u2019t exactly in line with the EA mentality of using reason and evidence to determine the ethical choices we make. But I also don\u2019t think we should completely ignore these kinds of emotions, and I think it\u2019s ok to be motivated by them, as long as we\u2019re not being entirely driven by our feelings at the expense of other strong considerations.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"3__Signalling_and_encouraging_others\"><strong>3. Signalling and encouraging others</strong></h2>\n<p>When I first tried being vegan, one of the key things that motivated and helped me was the fact that I was spending a lot of time around other vegans. <strong>By going vegan myself, therefore, there\u2019s some chance I\u2019ll encourage others to think more about their dietary choices and reduce their consumption of animal products</strong>. I\u2019m never going to be a militant vegan who tries to persuade everyone else she meets to go meat-free - it\u2019s just not my personality and I think it\u2019s unlikely to be effective - but I\u2019m happy to strike up non-confrontational conversations and discuss my reasons with people.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s unclear, though, whether being vegan really gives me much benefit here over being vegetarian. In fact, being vegan might even be worse because it seems to weird, and too unachievable for most people - whereas vegetarianism is something it\u2019s easier for most people to get on board with.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Main_uncertainties_here_1\">Main uncertainties here:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>To what extent will me being vegan lead others to consider their dietary choices more seriously compared to if I\u2019m just vegetarian?</strong> Could it even be worse, if I seem too \u201cweird\u201d or \u201cextreme\u201d for people to seriously identify with?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"Considerations_against_being_vegan\">Considerations against being vegan</h1>\n<h2 id=\"1__Inconvenience__enjoyment__willpower\">1. Inconvenience, enjoyment, willpower</h2>\n<p><strong>The only real reason I have for not being vegan is that it\u2019s somewhat inconvenient, takes some willpower, and requires me to put a bit more effort into planning and preparing meals</strong>. I also enjoy eating animal products, so there\u2019s some cost there too. There are a few different things here, but I think they\u2019re broadly the same issue, so I\u2019m lumping them under the same heading.</p>\n<p>I won\u2019t go into lots of detail here (though happy to do so if people are interested), but being vegan has a few different costs to me in this area:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It makes it harder to eat out with other people, since many restaurants don\u2019t offer vegan options.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I tend to cook and eat meals with my housemates (who aren\u2019t vegan), which is a great way to save time and money, and also a nice sociable thing to do. Being vegan would make it a bit more difficult for me to do this, and I might end up eating alone more often.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Making sure I maintain a healthy vegan diet is likely to take more time and energy than being vegetarian - it requires more planning ahead, and probably more cooking (but not necessarily loads, and I\u2019m generally quite happy cooking.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Being vegan requires some willpower - I like eggs, cheese, ice cream etc. - and since most people around me aren\u2019t vegan, that means I\u2019m often offered or around these foods, so have to put effort into resisting them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I enjoy eating animal products and get some pleasure out of them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>None of these are huge costs by any means, but they are costs. One argument that I hear from some vegans is that if you really care about animals, concerns about \u201cinconvenience\u201d and \u201cenjoyment\u201d should really be trivial - what is a minor inconvenience to you compared to a life of suffering for a chicken? While I\u2019m somewhat sympathetic to this argument, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite this simple. If, for example, the effect my diet has on animal suffering is really small or very uncertain, but costs me a lot of willpower and/or time that could be spent on other altruistic activities, the benefit might plausibly not be worth the cost.</p>\n<p>I broadly agree <a href=\"https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2014/11/21/when-should-an-effective-altruist-be-vegetarian/\">with Katja Grace</a> that if one can use the time/energy/willpower etc. that one would spend being vegetarian/vegan more effectively towards other altruistic activities, then it probably makes sense not to be vegetarian/vegan. But in my personal case, I\u2019m really not sure that the costs of veganism are fungible in this way - perhaps just because they really are relatively small. But I haven\u2019t thought about this a lot, and it\u2019s possible that I could find some way to use the time and/or willpower I\u2019d expend being vegan in an even better way.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Main_uncertainties_here_2\">Main uncertainties here:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Is the willpower I\u2019d be using to sustain a vegan diet something that could be actually be transferred to other things?</strong> Is this a possibility I should consider more seriously?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"2__Health_\">2. Health?</h2>\n<p>Though many people worry about the health risks of cutting out animal products, <strong>I actually think that on balance I\u2019m probably healthier vegan</strong>. The healthiest components of my diet are mostly vegan anyway - most of my meals are some combination of vegetables, beans/pulses, tofu, and carbs. Where animal products come in is mostly unnecessary additions - some cheese on top of my pasta, some cheese in a sandwich that could easily be replaced by something else, a splash of milk in my tea, eggs for brunch on the weekend every now and then, and the odd baked good. In most of these cases, the animal product could either be cut out or replaced with something healthier - I\u2019d just have pasta without cheese, I\u2019d put more avocado in my sandwich. When I\u2019m vegan, it gives me a great excuse not to eat various unhealthy things I tend to regret later anyway - cake, chocolate, cookies etc.</p>\n<p>Of course, I need to make sure I get the right supplements and get a balanced diet - but I enjoy cooking, and naturally enjoy experimenting with variations on my diet for health, so I don\u2019t imagine this would be too difficult. I could also totally be missing something really important here, so I\u2019d love to hear if people think I\u2019m not taking this consideration seriously enough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h1 id=\"95__vegan_\">95% vegan?</h1>\n<p>I don\u2019t think it necessarily have to be an all-or-nothing decision between either being fully vegan or not at all. I could probably get most of the benefits of being vegan by cutting out most of the animal products I eat and allowing myself these things occasionally when it\u2019s particularly inconvenient or I have particularly low willpower for some good reason.</p>\n<p>In theory this seems like it could work, but my main concern is that it\u2019s much easier to stick to a very simple rule - \u201cI\u2019m a vegan\u201d - than it is to stick to a vaguer one - \u201cI\u2019m 95% vegan.\u201d Without clear rules for when the \u201cexceptional\u201d cases occur, it\u2019s easy to just end up slipping into eating more and more animal products. It\u2019s also harder to develop negative associations around animal products - which might help with sustaining motivation - if you\u2019re eating them every now and then. I\u2019ve tried doing something like this in the past - just eating dairy and eggs \u201coccasionally\u201d, and found that my definition \u201coccasionally\u201d just becomes more and more frequent...</p>\n<p>One way to get around this might be to have very strict rules for when the 5% applies. For example, I\u2019ve considered having the strict rule of being vegan in everything I buy and cook myself but allowing myself to eat animal products when I go out. My main concern with this still is that it\u2019s easy to let those rules slip, or just to develop a stronger taste for eating those things if you\u2019re still having them semi-regularly. Perhaps one way to get around this would be to have regular \u201ccheck-in times\u201d when you reassess whether you\u2019ve been sticking to the rules you laid out, and make any tweaks or recommit to what you originally planned. Of course, all of this takes some time and energy, but it could well be worth it. Publicly committing to these rules, or telling a few other people about them, might also help me to ensure I stick to them.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d be particularly interested in hearing from others who do something like this - who are broadly vegetarian/vegan, but have strict rules for when exceptions can be made. What cases do your rules apply to? And how easy do you find it to stick to those rules?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h1 id=\"Overall___\">Overall...</h1>\n<p>I\u2019m still pretty uncertain, and I\u2019d love others\u2019 thoughts. Essentially, I think that the costs to me of being vegan in terms of willpower/inconvenience etc. are sufficiently low that I could easily do it if I were pretty convinced that the positive consequences were pretty large - but they\u2019re high enough that it\u2019s not totally easy for me to do it otherwise. I think the main things that would help me get clearer on this would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>If it turns out that I\u2019m substantially underestimating the consequentialist benefits of me giving up milk and eggs</strong> - i.e. it makes much more difference, or the difference it makes, is much more certain than I think.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>If it turns out there are other substantial benefits of me being vegan that I\u2019m missing</strong>, or I\u2019m underweighting other benefits like e.g. signalling benefits</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br> At the moment, my best guess is that I should try doing something like \u201c95% vegan\u201d (in reality probably an even higher percentage), but setting some very strict, clearly defined rules for exceptions.</p></div></div>"},

Her boy suffered congenital heart disease. He had been lucky to be born in a country where his condition was recognised at birth, and where he could be treated by experts. He and his family were lucky to live in a country with universal health care, so that they were not forced to decide between open heart surgery for a child and the shelter or feeding of the rest of their family. But despite luck and expertise his life was cut very short.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to comprehend the suffering of his parents. I can\u2019t encompass it. The urge to \u2018do something\u2019 is swift and strong. After some thought I decided to do the only useful thing I could think of: since I don\u2019t know them well enough to be a big emotional support, I prepared a few nourishing meals and a cake, and made a doorstop drop of food and beer.</p>\n<p>I did this because I thought it would help them a tiny bit not to have to put a meal together, and because I hoped it would help them feel not alone. I did this because it helped me to feel that by rallying in someone\u2019s distress I was helping hold back the sense of despair that confronted us in the wake of such a loss.</p>\n<p>When I reflected today though, I realised that these same motivations are an important part of why I continue supporting charities like AMF and SCI. As Julia Wise writes, those other mothers love their babies just as hard. Those babies have the same enchanting smiles of promise that my baby flashes in the morning, and their deaths are just as awful as this boy's passing. \u00a0And for a relatively small sum I can help - not just to take the edge off a day of grief for that other mother, but to keep her baby alive.</p>\n<p>For me, it strengthens and fosters my compassion \u2013 my literal feeling with \u2013 families far away, to offer support and care to those who are physically close to me. There is no dissonance about it: the feelings come from the same place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*We are in a large music group together, and also are both part of a small online parents group started by a mutual friend.</p></div></div>"},

Some were gung-ho about EA, claiming that effective altruism meant that we should spend <em>all</em> our money on EA charities, to the detriment of artistic culture, movies, music, and even maintaining museums. Others seemed to only be concerned with certain subsets of EA, like those who care only about the charity recommendations. One person I met at EA Global claimed that he uses EA to determine where to send his 10% pledge to, but that\u2019s the extent of his EA actions. He considers himself an EA, and rightly so, I think; after all, he is one of the most important parts of this community, and I\u2019ll explain why later in this post.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>There are those who claim that you\u2019re not a </span><span><em>true</em></span><span> EA unless you really push hard on all the EA principles. I\u2019ve never heard anyone claim that you have to be perfect, but I have heard people say that you need to give more than just 10%, that you\u2019re not really EA if you give to non-EA charities, that if you spend more than a few dollars on things like video games, then you can\u2019t really call yourself an EA. (These are not made-up accusations. I really have encountered people saying these things.)</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I get where these people are coming from. They\u2019re trying to maximize the output of good from their one life. And this makes sense. After all, effectiveness is all about getting the largest quotient of result over effort. We want the most results per effort given. For most people in the effective altruism community, this translates to accomplishing the most good per dollar. EAs focus on ensuring that our money goes to charities instead of sailboats (hence <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge\">the GWWC pledge</a>) and that, of the money sent to charity, that money goes to the right places (hence <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GW</a>/<a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/\">ACE</a>-style charity recommendations). These interpretations make sense to me.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>But the people who claim you need to do even more if you want to be a true EA are interpreting the effectiveness quotient somewhat differently:</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/c/c/dccb0f7626efe00dfe0031c10c2bfd89.png\" alt=\"Result / Effort = Good Created / Person\u2019s Life\"><br></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>They reason that effective altruism is all about creating the most good per life lived. In their interpretation, each of us has to maximize the good we produce throughout our lifetimes. For some, that would be through direct charity work, for others, it\u2019s a giving pledge, and for still others it might be building wealth to be allocated once they die.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>These people are laudable. I\u2019m not going to say that they are doing badly by making this choice with their life. But I am going to claim that these actions are supererogatory.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Ultimately, I think these people are using the wrong reference class. They\u2019ve plugged in incorrect numbers into the quotient, and are missing what\u2019s <em>really</em> important. I believe the quotient should instead be interpreted as:</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/8/9/c89714c98eddcfe60a668e26e67719ca.png\" alt=\"Result / Effort = Good Created / Marketable Individual Sustainable Effort\"><br></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>My claim is that the divisor should not be the full life of an individual EA, but instead each marketable and sustainable effort that is put in by each individual EA. This is a little convoluted, so I\u2019ll explain.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>As a first approximation, consider the divisor to be Individual Effort. This would mean that we\u2019d need to do the most good for each effort we make. Whatever we expend energy on should have \u201cmost good created\u201d as its ultimate purpose (in the sense of telos). But following this rule would lead to very short lives, as expending effort to eat food probably doesn\u2019t maximize the possible good one could do in the present. This approximation just doesn\u2019t consider the number of future moments of effort that are also possible to do good.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>So we then go to a second divisor approximation: Individual Sustainable Effort. Now we can try to make each effort we expend have \u201cmost good created\u201d as the telos, so long as that effort, in combination with other efforts, is sustainable. This approximation lets us eat food, sleep, and have recreation, as it recognizes that we need those things in order to continue doing good throughout the remainder of our lives. By this approximation, we should expend whatever minimal amount of time/money we spend on eating/sleeping that is possible. But this is missing something crucial: actually doing this would make our lives miserable. Sure, if it made it too miserable, we\u2019d stop being EAs -- so this principle would give us the minimal comfort necessary to allow us to continue doing good until we die (or indefinitely, depending on your stance on life extension). But we wouldn\u2019t be happy about it. (If you don\u2019t think that some EAs think this way, consider the fact that <a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/cheerfully.html\">Julia Wise actually had to argue that having a child was compatible with effective altruism</a>.)</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>That\u2019s where we get the next divisor approximation: Marketable Individual Sustainable Effort. Here we finally recognize that the good we do isn\u2019t just based on the good we do directly, but also the good we do indirectly by helping others become EAs as well. The minimal comfort level we need is not the level at which we can continue to do direct efforts indefinitely, but instead the level at which we can successfully market the EA mindset to others so that they can accomplish good as well. In other words, we shouldn\u2019t just get enough sleep to survive for another day of grueling EA work, we should get whatever threshold of sleep will allow us to both live a good life of comfort and pleasure, while maintaining the EA work we do.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Ensuring that things are marketable isn\u2019t sexy (even though marketing those things usually is), but it\u2019s an important component of the good each of us can accomplish. We are still at the beginning stages of our movement, though it is indeed growing quickly, and we need to be aware of how our choices of what is and is not a norm in this group can affect whether others decide to join the movement.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Giving What We Can had it right when they chose to make the pledge 10%. That number has historical familiarity with a western audience and doesn\u2019t seem to be too much for a modest-income individual to give. This allows it to be marketable. <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/profiles\">Even if some EAs give much more</a>, the main point here is that the <em>norm</em> should be a lower percentage like 10%. The Life You Can Save advocates for a looser standard for those with less income, and a higher standard for those with more income. <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Take-the-Pledge\">Their suggestion</a> is to give more than 10% if you make over $500k each year, and less than 10% if you make less. Their reasoning is that when it comes to lower-income people, the most important thing is volume; when it comes to higher-income people, the most important thing is magnitude.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Standard-lowering to lower the barrier of entry is important to those of us who market effective altruism to the mass audience. EAs who give more than 10% are awesome, but in order for this movement to spread more generally, we need more people at the 10% level. I\u2019m not saying anyone should lower their pledge -- but I am saying that we should be inclusive of new EAs who come in only at that pledge level and stay there.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>The above paragraph should be offensive to no one. I have high confidence that everyone reading it said to themselves: yeah, that\u2019s obvious. But when I make the same claim about sleeping, eating, or playing video games, that\u2019s when I seem to get pushback.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>EAs who get by on less than eight hours of sleep through polyphasic hacks are laudable. You guys have so much more time available to you with which you may accomplish good. But in order for the movement to spread more generally, we need the norm to be more like eight hours of sleep.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Those of you who spend less time on cooking by eating those powder meals are impressive. You spend so much less time and money on food that you have the ability to spend that money/time on more important things, like doing good. But in order for the movement to spread more generally, we need the norm to be something more like three meals a day, or at least eating when hungry, and taking the time to cook good meals, simply because eating well is a pleasure that most humans would not want to do without.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Those of you who don\u2019t play video games, who don\u2019t go out to the movies, who don\u2019t play CCGs -- you guys are great. By not expending so much time and energy on recreation, you can do much more good. But in order for the movement to succeed, we need the norm to include EAs having fun. Not just fun on the fringes, but EAs spending real money and time on whatever recreational things they like to do.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Effective altruism should be about creating the most good per marketable individual sustainable effort. We can\u2019t go too far on the marketable side, because then it isn\u2019t sustainable. We can\u2019t go too far on the sustainable side, or it won\u2019t be effort. Each of these adjectives reigns in the rest in a way that allows our movement as a whole to accomplish the most good. (<em>At least this is true in the near term, where most individuals are non-EAs. Once a certain threshold of people are EAs, the marketable aspect ceases to be as important, at which point maybe something else comes into play, like maximizing the happiness of that large EA group.</em>)</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>The best way to accomplish the most good is probably(?) to get very rich people/nations to give their money differently and more often. But most of us can\u2019t work on that kind of project, because we don\u2019t have access/influence on those people/nations. However, we can work on the second best way to accomplish good: growing the movement so that each of our effects are multiplied. Our individual efforts are great, but that extra 25% of time you get from cutting your sleeping hours in half could be replicated four-fold by just recruiting another person into effective altruism. If sleep reduction were the norm in EA circles, it would be much more difficult to recruit new EAs. (This doesn\u2019t mean that you should cease polyphasic sleep; it just means that polyphasic sleep is supererogatory to EA.)</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>I realize that the absurdity heuristic comes into play here. Just because powder-eating and polyphasic sleeping sound silly doesn\u2019t mean that we should reject them. Sometimes it is important to ignore our silliness heuristic and instead shut up and multiply. But we can only convince X people to do those things that seem silly, which only creates f(x) utility. Whereas we can instead downplay the silly-sounding stuff as an EA cultural norm, and instead recruit Y people to EA, which creates g(y) utility. My claim is that g(y) &gt; f(x), so we should focus on ensuring EA norms are marketable. This doesn\u2019t mean that individual EAs shouldn\u2019t try to be even more effective -- it just means that it shouldn\u2019t be perceived as a norm among the community.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>And now, a confession. I sleep a lot. I average around nine hours, but with a large variance each night. I like to eat well. I spend a lot to get the specific foods I like best, and I eat out more often than most people I know. I don\u2019t skimp on my playing budget. I play a lot of videos games -- on consoles, handhelds, computers, and mobile; I even co-host a video games podcast. I play board games regularly with a local playgroup, and I\u2019m almost always the one purchasing the games. I enjoy books. My house is filled with books, to the point where you might call every room except the kitchen a library room. Though probably this is more due to my housemate than to myself specifically.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>I do all these things because these things make my life enjoyable. These expenses of time and money are not cheap, but they help me to enjoy life not just to the point of sustainability, but beyond to the point of marketability.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>So do I count as an effective altruist, even though I spend so much time and money on sleeping, eating, and various forms of recreation? I\u2019d like to think so. I give 25% of my income each year, and I have for two years at this point. I have volunteered at three different EA organizations, and have worked at one for two years. I attended EA Global this year; I participate regularly in online discussion groups; I\u2019ve gone to a few local EA meetups. Maybe I have a poor prior, but I think most of you will consider me to be a full-fledged EA, not just a fringe EA.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Given that, I think that more of us who spend a lot of time on sleep, food, and recreation (even if it\u2019s stuff like M:tG, WoW, clubbing, scuba diving, etc.) should speak up and say that that\u2019s how we are living our lives. Right now, when people look through the facebook posts of well-known effective altruists, they see stuff like eating powder, sleeping less, and always-working-toward-the-cause. While I\u2019m not making the claim that what these people are doing isn\u2019t morally praiseworthy, I <em>am</em> making the claim that those of us who <em>don\u2019t</em> do those things should speak up more often so that the norm of EA is perceived as fun-loving 8-hour sleepers who enjoy the taste of food often.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>We shouldn\u2019t just spread a meme of giving to the best charities, or of giving 10% of income. We need to spread the meme of effective altruism itself, and that requires more of us to be vocal about just being regular people. Without approachable EA norms, growing our movement will be limited to those willing to do supererogatory acts.</span></p></div></div>"},

I know people whose families expected them to become lawyers or businesspeople, and others whose families would be appalled if they went into something so \"money-grubbing.\"</p>\n<p>This post is primarily aimed at those of us who grew up in cultures that emphasized a certain style of simplicity. In some cases I think it can be an advantage, for example, because it's easier to live below our means. But in other cases I think it leads us into bad decisions that prioritize our personal purity above the well-being of others.</p>\n<p>....</p>\n<p>I'll start with an illustration from history.\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Addams\">Jane Addams</a>, the founder of social work, spent her life striving to improve the conditions of poor immigrants and particularly working-class women in Chicago. In 1896, she traveled to Russia to meet with author Leo Tolstoy, whose ideas on solidarity with laborers had impressed her. Both Addams and Tolstoy struggled with how to deal with their privileged backgrounds; Tolstoy was a count and Addams had inherited a fortune as a young woman. Tolstoy, who was living on his family's estate dressing like a peasant and participating in the farm work, began the meeting by criticizing Addams' stylish dress. He urged her to follow him in taking up manual labor rather than spending all her time on administration.</p>\n<p>When Addams returned to the large settlement house she ran, she was determined to spend part of her workday in the bakery there rather than in her office. (Reminds me of the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undercover_Boss\">Undercover Boss</a></em> reality show in which CEOs work as janitors for two weeks.)</p>\n<p>But she grew frustrated with the inefficiency of spending part of her day as baker rather than director. \u201cThe half dozen people invariably waiting to see me after breakfast, the piles of letters to be opened and answered, the demand of actual and pressing human wants\u2014were these all to be pushed aside and asked to wait while I saved my soul by two hours\u2019 work at baking bread?\u201d (<em>Twenty Years at Hull House</em>, p. 197) She decided that she could do more for her neighbors by continuing her administrative work than by sharing in their manual labor.</p>\n<div><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-viSxs-VDuzU/Vk4NzjTZndI/AAAAAAAAElI/2EJsgCJRMpU/s1600/Ilya_Repin_-_Leo_Tolstoy_Barefoot_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\"><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-viSxs-VDuzU/Vk4NzjTZndI/AAAAAAAAElI/2EJsgCJRMpU/s320/Ilya_Repin_-_Leo_Tolstoy_Barefoot_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ct9GdhslJlg/Vk4Nx2x34qI/AAAAAAAAElA/yOBrBZmVAJo/s1600/JAMC_0000_0005_1437.jpg\"><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ct9GdhslJlg/Vk4Nx2x34qI/AAAAAAAAElA/yOBrBZmVAJo/s320/JAMC_0000_0005_1437.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></div>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I think Addams gets at an ongoing problem with tendencies to <em>act or appear</em>\u00a0a certain way rather than <em>accomplishing</em> anything in particular. (Certainly leftists and liberals are not the only ones to fall into this, but I'll focus on us here.)</p>\n<p>Tracy Kidder's\u00a0<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=B_wxkzFvHf8C&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=poor+people+don%27t+want+you+to+dress+like+them&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZcQ5X9IE1d&amp;sig=sREUwIv7y8aAkf_vXDS1xio4m1g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwA2oVChMIsbGGx4aYyQIVCHo-Ch1xnQ0v#v=onepage&amp;q=poor%20people%20don't%20want%20you%20to%20dress%20like%20them&amp;f=false\">book</a>\u00a0about doctor and humanitarian\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Farmer\">Paul Farmer</a>\u00a0cites him talking with other Partners in Health staff about \"the goofiness of radicals thinking they have to dress in Guatemalan peasant clothes. The poor don't want you to look like them. They want you to dress in a suit and go get them food and water.\"</p>\n<p>I have a friend who gives away much of his income but realized he needed to spend money on a nice suit to meet with people and influence their giving. Saving money by not buying a suit would actually have been a loss for the people he intends to help.</p>\n<p>.....</p>\n<p>Some of us come from religious traditions that emphasize voluntary simplicity and solidarity with the poor. I'm interested in the ways that this can help or hinder us in actually helping others.</p>\n<p>I've enjoyed reading some of the thoughts of a Franciscan friar on\u00a0<a href=\"http://breakinginthehabit.org/2012/07/11/solidarity-with-the-poor/\">voluntary poverty</a>. The Franciscan order was founded largely in response to the opulent lifestyle of the 13th-century Italian upper classes, and material simplicity has been an important part of their tradition ever since. But the writer, Brother Casey Cole, questions whether friars should take solidarity so far as to shoulder the difficulties that come with being <em>involuntarily\u00a0</em>poor, like buying low-quality appliances that break because you can't afford ones that last longer.</p>\n<p>I spent 10 years active in Quaker communities, a tradition which emphasizes simplicity. The main text of each regional Quaker group includes \"queries,\" or questions for reflection, on many topics. One group asks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is your life marked by simplicity?</li>\n<li>Are you free from the burden of unnecessary possessions?</li>\n<li>Do you refuse to let the prevailing culture and media dictate your needs and values?</li>\n</ul>\n<div><em>2003 Faith and Practice of Northwest Yearly Meeting</em></div>\n<p>I love this approach to simplicity as freedom. Other than my <a href=\"http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/\">Apartment Therapy</a>\u00a0habit, I think Jeff and I have been much happier by not letting media dictate our desires too much. Particularly as a parent, I'm wary of the ways we can be led into \"needing\" things that don't actually improve our quality of life.</p>\n<p>But I've also seen the idea of material simplicity extended farther than I think makes sense. At one point Quakers were going around policing the width of each other's hat brims lest somebody have one that was not \"plain\" enough. And today I think people sometimes slip into policing material possessions, particularly technology, rather than looking at whether these possessions actually improve our lives. I know people who still look down at smartphones as an unnecessary luxury. As a person who takes public transit, getting a smartphone has changed the way I travel\u2014there's much less getting lost, less rushing to catch a bus only to find it's running late. This material possession makes my life simpler and better. (I notice Brother Cole, quoted above, said his laptop and iPhone are the material possessions most important to him.)</p>\n<p>I've seen <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/09/10/no-cellphones-are-not-a-luxury-for-syrian-refugees/\">articles</a> explaining why so many refugees carry smart phones\u2014far from being a luxury, they are a vital source of information and connection to loved ones. Cell phone ownership even among the very poor in Africa has made it possible for them to do everything from <a href=\"https://10innovations.alumniportal.com/africas-mobile-revolution/a-mobile-banking-system.html\">transferring money</a> without access to a brick-and-mortar bank, to <a href=\"https://10innovations.alumniportal.com/africas-mobile-revolution/agriculture-and-health-care-mobile-changes.html\">tracking</a> cattle gestation periods, to <a href=\"https://10innovations.alumniportal.com/africas-mobile-revolution/agriculture-and-health-care-mobile-changes.html\">verifying</a> that anti-malarial drugs are real and not counterfeit. The way that technology enriches lives from Syria to San Francisco is something I'd like to embrace, not scorn.</p>\n<p>.....</p>\n<p>John Wesley, founder of the Methodist church, gave his\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.umcmission.org/Find-Resources/John-Wesley-Sermons/Sermon-50-The-Use-of-Money\">sermon</a> \"The Use of Money\" many times throughout the 18th century. In it, he advises followers not to reject money, but to use it wisely. \"The fault does not lie in the money, but in them that use it. It may be used ill: and what may not? But it may likewise be used well. . . . By it we may supply . . . a defence for the oppressed, a means of health to the sick, of ease to them that are in pain.\"</p>\n<p>Wesley urges followers to \"gain all you can\" without sacrificing their health or engaging in immoral action, \"save all you can\" by living simply, and then \"give all you can.\" The sermon is the first known proposal of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earning_to_give\">earning to give</a>.\"</p>\n<p>.....</p>\n<p>But those of us who came from traditions emphasizing simplicity (whether via religion or general hippie culture) were often taught to distrust money. \"Money is the root of all evil,\" we heard, rather than the full <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+6%3A10&amp;version=KJV\">quotation</a> \"The <em>love of money</em> is the root of all evil.\"</p>\n<p>My mother spoke proudly of the low-paying professions her family tended toward: \"Farmers, ministers, teachers, musicians\u2014if it pays badly, we've done it!\"</p>\n<p>When I started to consider earning to give, I kept noticing a reaction of disgust to the idea of having a high-paid job. I couldn't get away from my vision of \"rich people\" as bad and greedy people. The idea of being associated with them, for example by going into law and then donating most of my earnings, turned my stomach. That attitude isn't helpful, and I don't want to pass it on to my children.</p>\n<p>I think some of this comes from embarrassment about the privilege I have. I grew up in a rich country with parents who could give me everything I needed. I have a college education, I'm healthy, and I'm able to do many things I set my mind to. I got lucky in a lot of ways, and I'm sad that not everyone has these things.</p>\n<p>But squandering this privilege by pretending I don't have it would <em>not help anyone except me</em>. It might make me feel better, but me feeling better about my privilege is not the point. I could be a good hippie and spend my days volunteering at the local library and my evenings making pottery in my basement. No one could accuse me of making things worse, but I would hardly be making things <em>better</em> for people in extreme need. I think we should be less like Tolstoy barefoot in the woods, and more like Jane Addams using her wealth, connections, education, and skills for the benefit of others.</p>\n<p>If we want to make a better and fairer world for everyone, we should use every tool we have\u2014including money\u2014to do so.</p></div></div>"},

Sure, there may be difficulties with subpopulations who are too busy or subpopulations who don\u2019t have landlines (though surveys now call cell phones).</p>\n<p>Contrast this with trying to survey effective altruists. It\u2019s hard to know who is an EA without asking them first, but we can\u2019t exactly send surveys to random people all across the world and hope for the best. Instead, we have to do our best to figure out where EAs can be found, and try to get the survey to them.</p>\n<p>We did our best, but some groups may have been oversampled (more survey respondents, by percentage, from that group than are actually in the true population of all EAs) or undersampled (not enough people in our sample from that subpopulation to be truly representative). This is a limitation that we can\u2019t fully resolve, though we\u2019ll strive to improve next year. At the bottom of this analysis, we include a methodological appendix that has a detailed discussion of this limitation and why we think our survey results are still useful.</p>\n<p>You can find much more than you\u2019d ever want in the methodological appendix at the bottom of the PDF.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>In sum, this is probably the most exhaustive study of the effective altruism movement in existence. \u00a0It certainly exhausted us!</p>\n<p>I'm really excited about the results and look forward to how they will be able to inform our movement.</p>\n</div></div></div>"},
{"date": "26th Sep 2015", "title": "Why we need more meta", "author": "Benjamin_Todd", "num_comments": "16 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Peter Hurford recently wrote a popular post <a href=\"/ea/my/ea_risks_falling_into_a_meta_trap_but_we_can/\">\"EA risks falling into a meta-trap. But we can avoid it.\"</a>\u00a0Many people seemed to infer from the post that we're doing too many meta activities, and I've now seen the post cited several times as a reason not to donate to meta-charities.</p>\n<p>I think Peter presents good arguments, but drawing this conclusion is wrong. Here's a couple of reasons.</p>\n<p><em>(The following is quickly written so not as well vetted as I'd like, and doesn't represent the views of 80,000 Hours).</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"1__Peter_doesn_t_actually_argue_we_need_less_meta\">1) Peter doesn't actually argue we need less meta</h2>\n<p>Peter presents some arguments against meta-charities, and it's true if you've never considered these arguments, then you should become more skeptical about meta-charities.</p>\n<p>But these arguments are already known by most people already working on meta-charity. Everyone agrees we don't want the EA movement to be 100% meta, meta will eventually hit diminishing returns, and that many meta projects won't work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The interesting questions are rather:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Where does the balance of meta and object level work lie today?</li>\n<li>Is that balance too far towards meta or object level?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter doesn't directly address these two questions, so doesn't actually answer the question of whether we need more or less meta. The closest he gets is stating:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Right now I\u2019m aiming at donating 50% of my pool to the best meta-projects I know and spending the other 50% on direct impact through GiveWell\u2019s top charities. I don\u2019t know if 50% is the correct number, but I hope this will set an example of what I want the movement as a whole to do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And quoting Jeff Kaufman saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We need to do things that help people alongside growing the movement, and personally I try to divide my efforts 50-50.\u00a0</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My estimate, however, is that the EA movement is spending less than 5% of its resources on meta activities,(1) so a 50:50 division would mean we should scale up meta 10-fold.</p>\n<p>My guess is that the optimal overall allocation is more like 10-20%, so I'm actually *less* enthusiastic about meta than Peter, but I still think meta should be grown substantially.(2)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"2__Peter_uses_a_weird_definition_of_meta\">2) Peter uses a weird definition of meta</h2>\n<p>In the comments, it emerges that Peter doesn't include priorities research or marketing for object level causes in his definition of meta. Rather, he's mainly concerned about 'second level' meta, which involves promoting effective altruism in abstract, with the hope that people do good object level projects in the future.</p>\n<p>However, the vast majority of meta today is priorities research or marketing of object level causes. (And this is how I use the term)</p>\n<p>Direct promotion of effective altruism is only pursued by one full-time organisation, EAO, some volunteers (largely local group leaders) and a few projects like Will's book. Until the last year or so, we had almost no direct promotion of effective altruism.</p>\n<p>If you're only concerned with 'second level' meta, then the proportion that's being carried out today is even smaller, which again means that Peter thinks we need more meta rather than less.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"3__Doesn_t_weigh_against_very_strong_arguments_in_favor_of_meta\">3) Doesn't weigh against very strong arguments in favor of meta</h2>\n<p>Many meta-charities have decent evidence they've achieved leverage ratios of over 10x in the past, and some have achieved leverage ratios of over 1000 (GiveWell has spent millions, but it's now partnered with a foundation that has billions). The possibility of having over 10x as much impact is a big deal.</p>\n<p>Meta is also extremely neglected. <a href=\"http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/content.view/cpid/42#.VgccCp3BzRY\">$360bn is given to charity each year in the US</a>, but only a few million dollars are spent on effective altruist style meta, or 0.0003%. Even if you include philanthropy think tanks and the research-arms of strategic foundations, my guess is that broad-meta is still way under 1% of total philanthropy. (And <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2014/07/interview-with-caroline-fiennes-about-opportunities-in-effective-philanthropy/\">much of this evaluation research is never published</a>, so doesn't really count).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In sum, Peter presents important arguments, but we probably need more meta rather than less, and based on what he says, Peter seems to agree.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Notes</em></p>\n<p>(1)\u00a0In 2014, about $40m of funding was allocated on the basis of GiveWell's recommendations, whereas only a couple of million dollars was spent on meta activities.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/about/impact\">http://www.givewell.org/about/impact</a><br>If you also include GWWC donors and the Open Philanthropy Project, then meta is an even smaller fraction.</p>\n<p>Of course, you could make a narrower definition of the EA movement than 'everyone donating to GiveWell recommended charities', but you'd need to make it pretty restrictive or weird to find the ratio is currently over 50%.</p>\n<p>People who feel like meta is very popular today are being biased by selection effects. When you meet EAs or talk to those on the forum, they're far more interested in meta than the average, and that's because the people most enthusiastic about meta are the most likely to want to do movement building activities and talk to other EAs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(2) I don't think individuals should follow this 10-20% allocation though. Rather, individuals should try to move the overall balance more in the optimal direction. So, if you think the overall allocation should be 10-20%, then you should probably allocate most of your resources to meta activities (perhaps holding back ~25% for object level activities for learning and signalling).</p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "22nd Dec 2015", "title": "Quantifying the Impact of Economic Growth on Meat Consumption", "author": "kbog", "num_comments": "38 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p></p>\n<p>\n\n(update: see https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EztxZhPQ8Qv8xWe3v/kbog-did-an-oopsie-new-meat-eater-problem-numbers)\n\n</p><p>I decided to do some analysis to gain insight on the <a href=\"http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=30&amp;t=214\">impact of economic growth on meat consumption in the developing world</a>, which has occasionally been discussed in the past.</p>\n<p>First I took the finding of York and Gossard (2004) that for every $1,000 increase in per capita PPP GDP, African countries consume 1.66 kg more meat per person per year.1 For some perspective on the significance of that difference in GDP, see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita</a>.</p>\n<p>Then I used FAOSTAT data on meat production2 and consumption3 from various samples of low income African countries which are targeted by Givewell-recommended top charities to determine what proportion of that 1.66 kg is likely to come from various types of meat.</p>\n<p>I excluded dairy and eggs because I figured that all those animals are also slaughtered for meat at some point and therefore are already taken into account, given that these are developing countries. Moreover, egg production numbers are not available whereas dairy farming causes by far the lowest amounts of suffering. I also excluded game meat because its impact is on wild animal suffering, it isn\u2019t farmed, and I doubt that marginal meat consumption includes game meat. Finally, I excluded meat of \u201call other types\u201d from the analysis.</p>\n<p>I also excluded fish because there is no significant correlation between income and fish consumption in African countries.1</p>\n<p>Then I used Brian Tomasik\u2019s estimates of suffering per kg to determine days of suffering caused to various animals. For cattle, camels, horses, mules, and asses I used his estimate for suffering per kg of beef; for pigs, sheep and goats I used his estimate for suffering per kg of pork; for all poultry and rabbits I used his estimate of suffering per kg of chicken.4 Even though Tomasik is uncertain about these numbers themselves and points out that they shouldn't be taken at face value, they provide a decent general guide.</p>\n<p>This gave me numbers of days of suffering for the various kinds of animals farmed in sub-Saharan Africa. Note that Tomasik adjusted the number of days of suffering to account for the differences in average subjective badness based on how different kinds of animal farms operate in the US.</p>\n<p>Here are some significant considerations not taken into account in the model that will affect the amount of suffering caused to farm animals. (Plus sign means that this consideration will cause the amount of suffering to be greater than the analysis indicates. Minus sign means that this consideration will cause the amount of suffering to be less than the analysis indicates. Question mark indicates that the direction is unclear.) Together, they give strong reason to be uncertain about the results of these calculations.</p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Domestic animals are smaller in developing parts of Africa than they are in US factory farms, meaning more animals are raised per quantity of meat. (+)</p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 African farms are subject to generally weaker standards of regulation, slaughter methods, etc. (+)</p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the new meat consumption in Africa is poultry and pork,5 so the numbers in these calculations give too much weight to less-suffering-intensive cattle. (+)</p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Marginal African farm production is not always going to be factory farming and may involve less intensive conditions than farming in the US. (-) <em>(However, much of the new production is factory farms,6 and traditional farming may not be any more humane.)</em></p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There may be supply side elasticities on a regional level. (-)</p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Suffering per kg could be different for goats and sheep than it is for pigs. (?)</p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Production ratios may differ from consumption ratios of different types of meat in the target countries. (?) <em>(Not the case for the 4th calculation.)</em></p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Consumption ratios of different types of meat for poor Africans may differ from that of Africans in general. (?)</p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The income effect on meat consumption for poor Africans in the target countries may differ from that of Africans in general. (?)</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Due_to_these_considerations__I_would_say_that_the_numbers_here_should_be_taken_with_a_grain_of_salt__probably_allowing_for_a_factor_of_____10_for_reasonable_but_not_great_confidence_\">Due to these considerations, I would say that the numbers here should be taken with a grain of salt, probably allowing for a factor of +/- 10 for reasonable but not great confidence.<br></strong></p>\n<p>Considerations entirely outside the model: impact of development on wild animal suffering, climate change, technological progress, global economic development, etc.</p>\n<p>Another thing to underline: this is the effect of <em>economic development</em> on meat consumption. It is <strong>not</strong> the effect of <em>economic aid</em> on meat consumption. Depending on how much you think AMF/SCI/DWI contribute to changes in income per capita, you will have to evaluate them differently. Even GiveDirectly\u2019s effects aren\u2019t straightforward to calculate per donor because GDP here is being measured in terms of purchasing power parity, not a nominal currency conversion.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve left the actual numbers for the end because I didn\u2019t want anyone to take them and run with them without first having to read all the disclaimers about uncertainty and assumptions. So here is my quick summary: depending on how we are measuring meat consumption in aid target countries, and including my +/-10 guesstimate for certainty as well as taking the highest and lowest values of the 4 different calculations I performed, an increase in $1000 to a person\u2019s income will generate:</p>\n<p>Between 0.04 and 13 days of large animal suffering (per person per year at $1000 additional income); median about 1</p>\n<p>Between 0.16 and 41 days of pig, goat, and sheep suffering; median about 2</p>\n<p>Between 0.65 and 138 days of chicken and rabbit suffering; median about 10</p>\n<p>Clearly if the answer is at the low end of the range then economic development is unequivocally good in direct well-being respects. If the answer is near the high end then it could be difficult to claim that the welfare benefits of economic development are more important than the animal suffering, depending on how much you care about animals.</p>\n<p>Now as Carl Shulman points out in the comments, if this possibility is troubling to you, then you should reconsider why you aren't prioritizing animal-advocacy charities over poverty charities in the first place.</p>\n<p>Finally, here are the Excel sheets so that you can view them:</p>\n<p>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/192J3lQgi7nlsksSLrx9B_NUqqnpfKC1dNa5oF2Fnr9w/edit?usp=sharing</p>\n<p>And here they are in editable form:</p>\n<p>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DUEDkKgsJCEg0vADSm1UPVmsTOMxJe1BpI3D232VDYU/edit?usp=sharing</p>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<p>1. <a href=\"http://smas.chemeng.ntua.gr/miram/files/publ_141_10_2_2005.pdf\">http://smas.chemeng.ntua.gr/miram/files/publ_141_10_2_2005.pdf</a> York and Gossard study on incomes and meat consumption</p>\n<p>2. <a href=\"http://faostat3.fao.org/download/Q/QL/E\">http://faostat3.fao.org/download/Q/QL/E</a> FAOSTAT data on production</p>\n<p>3. <a href=\"http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/FBS/E\">http://faostat3.fao.org/download/FB/FBS/E</a> FAOSTAT data on consumption</p>\n<p>4. <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods/\">http://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods/</a> Brian Tomasik\u2019s numbers on farm animal suffering</p>\n<p>5. <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/guycollender/trends-in-livestock-production-and-consumption-cees-de-haan-world-bank\">http://www.slideshare.net/guycollender/trends-in-livestock-production-and-consumption-cees-de-haan-world-bank</a> World Bank slideshow, shows that most new meat consumption is poultry and pork (slide 4)</p>\n<p>6. <a href=\"http://www.worldwatch.org/node/1826\">http://www.worldwatch.org/node/1826</a> Factory farming is the fastest growing type of food production, especially in the developing world.</p></div></div>"},

Thanks Peter for suggesting that theme, which is a lovely way to get to know each other, and Michael for instituting the blogging themes.</span></p>\n<p><span>My origin story is very much centred around people. I first started taking effective giving really seriously because of the people I met who were doing so and I\u2019ve stayed involved in the community because of the people. I\u2019m so grateful to the kind, interesting people I\u2019ve met (whether in person or online!) who are all working so hard to help others. They\u2019ve inspired me to live up to my values, made me realise that I really can make a difference, and supported me to do so. Thanks guys!</span></p>\n<p><span>I\u2019ve been vaguely involved in charity since school \u2013 organising penny races, hassling the other kids to bake cakes for bake sales, volunteering at Oxfam. But I didn\u2019t feel particularly motivated, because it was all a little ad hoc. We didn\u2019t really know what causes to support, and mostly we were setting up things events we enjoyed (like selling goes with a toy gun trying to shoot down tin cans in a classroom!). I actually studied Peter Singer\u2019s arguments in Philosophy class, and found it really compelling that when I had an income I ought to donate a significant proportion of it, given how much more benefit others could get from it. But no-one else seemed to believe that, or act on it, so I just figured I wouldn\u2019t end up caring either.</span></p>\n<p><span>At Oxford, similar factors still let me rationalise inaction. In particular, I didn\u2019t really know where to donate \u2013 there are so many charities, and I didn\u2019t feel I had any way to justify giving to one rather than another. I think the first time that really changed was during my Masters, when I chatted to other people in my year, particularly Will MacAskill, about where to donate. He suggested that the best way to choose among charities was to try to find out which charities helped others the most with a certain donation, and donate there. I remember wondering at the time why I had never Googled \u2018which charity is the most effective\u2019. I was pretty interested not just in which charities were the most cost-effective, but also how to find that out, so spent a lot of time chatting to Will and Toby Ord. It turned out they were planning to set up an organisation called Giving What We Can. GWWC ended up launching during our exams. I thought it was an amazing project, but what actually ended up dragging me out of my exam work was wanting to support the dedication of my classmate who was able to do all of this during his exams (still so impressed Will pulled that off and still got a 1<sup>st</sup>!).</span></p>\n<p><span>It seems funny to look back at the amazement and wonder I felt at finding people who cared enough to be donating so much of their income. I wasn\u2019t convinced I\u2019d ever actually end up donating 10% of my income, let alone any more than that. But the people I met seemed so inspiring and knowledgeable I thought getting involved would definitely be my best shot at living up to my ideals. So I did! I volunteered doing research, then managing volunteers, then running the Operations team. At some point, it started feeling surprisingly standard to donate at least 10% of one\u2019s income to the most effective charities, so taking the <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/become-member\">Pledge to Give</a>\u00a0ended up not being as scary as I thought.</span></p>\n<p><span>By the summer of 2011, Giving What We Can was growing steadily and Will and Ben Todd had set up 80,000 Hours. We started to realise that if we wanted them to grow faster, we would need to professionalise. We decided to register them as one organisation for flexibility and efficiency, and after what felt like a very long naming process - which ended up being very much worth it -\u00a0the Centre for Effective Altruism was born. I got to be the one working out how you register with Company\u2019s House, how you become a charity, and how you employ staff. All of which, surprisingly, turned out to be fascinating.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>In the summer of 2012 CEA first took paid staff and I took over from Will as the Executive Director of Giving What We Can. I feel really fortunate that I now get to be the one introducing people to others who can inspire them to live up to their values, and help people find the information they need to work out where to donate. I love that I get to live my life alongside people who continue to inspire me daily with how much they care about others and how hard they work to help them. I\u2019d very much like to give as many other people that opportunity as I can!

{"date": "23rd Oct 2015", "title": "Burnout and self-care", "author": "Julia_Wise", "num_comments": "7 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>Reposted from <a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/2015/10/burnout-and-self-care.html\">Giving Gladly</a>.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I think effective altruism often runs into questions about self-care and boundaries, and might have a few things to learn from social work.</p>\n<p>For people in helping professions (like nurses, therapists, and clergy), training programs often warn against burnout and \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion_fatigue\">compassion fatigue</a>.\" To prevent this, training emphasizes self-care. Self-care might include exercise, sleep, spending time with loved ones, spiritual practice, hobbies, and (at least among my coworkers) the latest episode of \"Scandal.\" My workplace asks every prospective hire about self-care, because we want someone who has a plan for not burning out.</p>\n<p>As a helping professional, you maintain boundaries to protect both yourself (you do not tell clients where you live) and clients (you do not burden them with your personal problems). And often boundaries are something you maintain to keep yourself sane.</p>\n<p>One early lesson for me, when I was an intern at a psychiatric hospital, came while sitting and talking with a young patient before I left for the evening. When it was time to catch my bus home, I told him I had to leave. \"You get to go home,\" he said sadly, \"but I don't get to go home.\" I felt awful for him, and later I asked my supervisor if I should have kept him company a little longer. \"No,\" my supervisor said, \"Go home when it's time to go home. There will <em>always</em> be someone who wants you to stay. You can't come in here and do a good job if you're worn out from the day before.\"</p>\n<p>To me, that's an example of what one\u00a0<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=fHqQAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=boundaries+and+self-care&amp;lr=\">author</a>\u00a0on burnout calls \"boundaried generosity.\" I will give my best up until this point, and then I will stop. That's what makes high-intensity, compassionate work sustainable.</p>\n<p>The same principles are applicable to helping work that isn't face-to-face. I've noticed that some of the highest-achieving people I know in effective altruism take sleep pretty seriously and don't skimp in that area. They've learned it's not worth it. They also seem to genuinely enjoy their time off. Unlike Susan Wolf's specter of the \"<a href=\"http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Courses/susanwolfessay1982.pdf\">moral saint</a>,\" humorless and single-minded, these people know how to have fun.</p>\n<p>But younger people in particular seem to struggle with the balance of self-care and altruism. Often after I speak to a student group, someone will tell me they wonder if they're wrong to spend money traveling to visit far-away friends or buying things for the mother that scrimped to send them to college. It's hard to think of a better recipe for burnout than distancing yourself from friends and family! No, I don't recommend cutting out this kind of thing if you want your passion for helping others to last more than a few years.</p>\n<p>For me, this was an important reason to make a budget rather than asking \"Should I donate this money instead?\" every time I was in a checkout line. It was the equivalent of going to work with no plan about when to go home<span>\u2014</span>should I see one more client this afternoon? Three? Five? Knowing I'm leaving work after 8 hours lets me be whole-hearted in my work during that time. In the same way, having a budget allows me to be whole-hearted both in what I give (because I know that money is only for giving) and in what I spend (because I know that money is only for me and my family).</p>\n<p>It is okay to take care of yourself.

It\u2019s obvious that movement building cannot be always better than direct work, but knowing how to compare them presents a challenge.</p>\n<p>In this article I introduce and explore a model of movement growth which tracks individuals\u2019 awareness of and inclination towards the movement. I aim to understand when movement building activities are better or worse than direct work, and apply the model to give my views on movement growth in the effective altruist and related communities.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Part_1__Theory\">Part 1: Theory</strong></p>\n<p>In the first half of this paper I introduce a model for thinking about movement growth, and terminology to refer to critical concepts. We model individuals as having varying levels of <em>awareness</em> about the movement, and varying <em>inclinations</em> towards it. We assume that these two characteristics can represent the major drivers of interaction with the movement. We explore the consequences this Awareness/Inclination Model (AIM), particularly looking at the long-term counterfactual effects of direct work compared to \u2018<em>publicity\u2019</em>, which aims at increasing awareness of the movement, and \u2018<em>advocacy\u2019</em>, which aims at improving inclinations towards the movement. This involves analysing different possible long-term trajectories the movement may be on.</p>\n<p>If we accept the model, this has some general implications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For early-stage movements, the effects on movement growth are a key consideration in deciding between different activities. For relatively mature movements, direct work is usually better than movement growth.</li>\n<li>It is more important to focus on increasing awareness than improving inclination, if:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><span>o<span>\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></span>the movement has a natural maximum size that we cannot change; or</p>\n<p><span><span>o<span>\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></span>essentially everyone will join the movement after they know enough about it; or</p>\n<p><span><span>o<span>\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></span>direct work earlier is much more important than direct work later; or</p>\n<p><span><span>o<span>\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></span>it is very hard to change inclination relative to awareness.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Otherwise improving inclination may often be better than increasing awareness (this is sensitive to beliefs about some parameters).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><!--[if !mso]> <mce:style><! v\\:* {behavior:url(#default#VML);} o\\:*

It\u2019s been suggested as </span><a href=\"http://wiki.effectivealtruismhub.com/w/index.php?title=What_small_things_can_an_EA_do%3F\"><span>one of the small things EAs can do</span></a><span> to most help others, and many effective altruists support </span><a href=\"http://www.thehumaneleague.com/\"><span>charities that work to inspire people to reduce their consumption of animal products</span></a><span> or helped farmed animals in other ways.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>But there\u2019s plenty of opposition from people towards changing their diet from the current social norm of eating animals, and the effective altruism community is no exception. </span><a href=\"http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/06/4-ways-people-rationalize-eating-meat.html\"><span>The most common reasons</span></a><span> people eat animals have been called:</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>The Four 'N's: that meat eating is </span><span>Natural</span><span> (\"humans are natural carnivores\"), </span><span>Necessary</span><span> (\"meat provides essential nutrients\"), </span><span>Normal</span><span> (\"I was raised eating meat\") and </span><span>Nice</span><span> (\"it's delicious\"). Of all these reasons \"necessary\" was the most common.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>As effective altruists focused on evidence-based reasoning, we can easily overcome the first two roadblocks because we know (i) the first is a fallacious </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature\"><span>appeal to nature</span></a><span> </span><span>\u2014 naturalness simply isn\u2019t a proper justification for goodness with obvious counterexamples like murder and cannibalism</span><span>, and (ii) a balanced vegetarian/vegan diet </span><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864\"><span>can supply all necessary nutrients and even have substantial health benefits</span></a><span>. We could also add that (iii) something that\u2019s normal isn\u2019t necessarily good. Slavery, murder, racism, genocide have all been normal at various times in human history. Tackling the last reason is tough, although (iv) any vegan can tell you that when they serve vegan food without mentioning its lack of animal products, the reaction is often much better than if they say it\u2019s vegan beforehand, so we should be mindful of </span><a href=\"http://evavivalt.com/2015/11/veganism-part-2-psychological-biases-and-food-choice\"><span>our biases</span></a><span> that make us overestimate the costs of veganism. Most importantly, even if it is nice for you, it\u2019s not nice for the animals!</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"Social_norms_and_institution_focused_messaging\"><span>Social norms and institution-focused messaging</span></h2>\n<p><span>Regardless, it\u2019s clear vegetarianism/veganism is very difficult for some people, even if that difficulty is often based in social norms or biases.</span><span> </span><a href=\"/ea/ba/when_should_an_effective_altruist_be_vegetarian/\"><span>Some have even suggested</span></a><span> that going vegetarian or vegan is so difficult that it\u2019s actually not a good choice for many effective altruists. While many animal-friendly effective altruists disagree with the reasoning in those arguments, I think they\u2019re right that the individual diets of effective altruists shouldn\u2019t be our primary focus. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>In general, focusing on individual consumption </span><a href=\"https://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/confrontation-consumer-action/\"><span>doesn\u2019t seem like a good idea</span></a><span> for most social movements, largely because it lacks the provocation of moral outrage that facilitates the viral growth of new ideas, attitudes, and behavior. For example, if you tell me the source of the issue is my own actions, I immediately become defensive, try to rationalize my behavior, and am unlikely to adopt your views. But if you tell me that an institution is at fault, like the animal agriculture industry, I\u2019m free to be as outraged as I should be at the horrors of animal farming.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I think something we can all do, given the difficulty of personal dietary change, is to promote the norm that all effective altruism events should be (at least) vegetarian. I think this avoids the issue of personal defensiveness or difficulty, since even the most steadfast omnivores can\u2019t be threatened by the simple prospect of a few vegetarian meals, while preserving the most important effect we\u2019d get from every effective altruist going vegetarian</span><span>, </span><span>that </span><span>we acknowledge the moral atrocities of animal agriculture and support a future where all sentient beings, human or otherwise, are given due consideration</span><span>.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"Potential_concerns\"><span>Potential concerns</span></h2>\n<p><span>Some might worry that vegetarian events will weird people out, but this concern seems to almost exclusively exist in the rationalist community</span><span> </span><span>\u2014 the anecdotal experience of myself and many others I know indicates most people react to vegetarian fare as a health-conscious, ethical decision. I\u2019d be open to evidence to the contrary here, but of all the weird things effective altruists do, it seems this is a very minor concern if appearing normal is our priority. Similarly, someone might worry that vegetarian fare will be hard to find. Again, I only hear this concern in very specific social circles, and I\u2019ve never seen it happen in practice.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Another concern might be that even if all effective altruist events being vegetarian would be a powerful message, one individual event serving animal bodies surely wouldn\u2019t make the difference. I think this is a reasonable perspective, but EA is large enough now that we really need to consider our decisions as a community rather than just as individuals or isolated groups. If we want to make the huge impact on the world we all desire, we need to work together and look beyond our individual situations because that allows us to collectively achieve things none of us could alone, like making this powerful statement against the torture and objectification of sentient beings.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Others might believe that helping animals abused in animal agriculture isn\u2019t the most important issue for them to work on, so they shouldn\u2019t even spend small amounts of effort on the cause. I think this view makes sense in an isolated context for some individuals, but I think it\u2019s a bad norm for the effective altruism movement. Much of our strength comes from having a strong community of do-gooders working on a diversity of causes who are able to join together for different projects to multiply their impact. I think an important community norm in EA is: </span><span>we shouldn\u2019t take actions that obviously and severely harm the work many other EAs are doing. Moreover, we should be willing to take small actions that others think are very important, even if they don\u2019t make sense given our particular world-view</span><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span><span>Of course, this is challenging because only one major focus area of effective altruism, as far as I know, is focused on an issue most humans clearly participate in on a day-to-day basis. So there\u2019s not an analogous situation to help other people understand this from an animal advocate\u2019s perspective, but to put it mildly, when other people eat animals at EA events, it feels as if some people at that event gathered in a circle and began writing hate articles against the </span><a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\"><span>Centre for Effective Altruism</span></a><span> or cutting up malaria nets that the </span><a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/\"><span>Against Malaria Foundation</span></a><span> was planning to distribute. It feels like a slap in the face to our work, and worse, like a dismissal of the plight of the billions of suffering farmed animals.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>It\u2019s also worth mentioning that some people have allergies or other medical conditions that could make certain dietary restrictions more difficult. I\u2019ve mostly heard this levered against vegan fare, but it could apply to vegetarian as well, not to mention that milk, eggs, and fish are some of </span><a href=\"http://www.foodallergy.org/allergens\"><span>the most common allergies</span></a><span> in the United States. For example, something that prevents you from eating beans would exclude several common vegetarian entrees. But it seems that a vegetarian event can still accommodate these people if care is taken in preparation and choice of dishes to serve, especially given the diversity of medical needs I\u2019ve seen at other vegetarian/vegan events. So, as would still be the case with a non-vegetarian event, event organizers should take care to customize their fare so that all serious medical needs can be accommodated.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"Looking_forward\"><span>Looking forward</span></h2>\n<p><span>It\u2019s also worth mentioning that there are several other benefits to EA events being vegetarian, like that vegetarian events could help some effective altruists transition to a vegetarian diet because it shows the viability of vegetarian meals and overcomes the crucial first step in the formation of a new habit. Eating animals also leads people to </span><a href=\"http://psp.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/10/06/0146167211424291\"><span>judge animals as less important</span></a><span> than they would otherwise. We want to get as close to clear-headed, debiased moral decision-making as possible, and actively participating in the issue at hand seems like it makes this decision-making much more difficult.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Perhaps more importantly, many effective altruists are bothered by the sight of animal products because it reminds them of the massive suffering in animal agriculture. Although this may seem weird because a piece of meat is so far removed from that tragedy, remember that, \u201cThe mark of a civilized human is the ability to look at a column of numbers, and weep.\u201d If we cry at numbers, doesn\u2019t it make sense to feel disturbed by a cut up body that represents billions of abused sentient creatures?</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>So this holiday season, as you eat and make merry with your fellow do-gooders, I\u2019d ask that you try leaving animals off your plate and encourage others to do the same. The personal costs are minimal (many would even say it\u2019s a benefit!), and the effective altruism community can do huge amounts of good by adopting this simple norm.</span></p></div></div>"},

While I understand why Dylan Matthews could form this view at a distance from the people involved, I think it is an inaccurate description.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Reason_one\">Reason one</strong></p>\n<p>The early adopters of the view were more mathematicians, philosophers or interdisciplinary researchers. I personally first became worried about artificial intelligence when the community was much smaller, and was studying genetics and economics. Many computer scientists <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/22/ai-researchers-on-ai-risk/\">have now come around</a>, but were if anything relatively resistant compared to people in related fields.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Reason_two\">Reason two</strong></p>\n<p>More importantly, belief that artificial intelligence presents a big risk is more likely to lead you to despair than a rosy outlook in which you can be a hero. In the early days, most people who were worried about AI felt completely disempowered because i) there was no clear path to a solution, and indeed one may not exist at all, ii) even if a solution exists, most people who were concerned thought they were not personally qualified to do any of the relevant work to solve the problem, including me.</p>\n<p>The thought that superintelligent machines may destroy everything you care about, and there may well be nothing you can do about it, is hardly the most appealing belief. Rather than walking into a phone booth and putting on a superhero outfit, many people who read these arguments became anxious and despondent. That remains the case today.</p>\n<p>But it is a belief that nevertheless spread, in my view because the underlying arguments, best laid out in the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199678111\">Superintelligence</a>, are remarkably hard to convincingly rebut.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Reason_three\">Reason three</strong></p>\n<p>Almost everyone I know who is now especially worried about artificial intelligence initially thought they could use their skills well in another cause areas such as reducing poverty or animal suffering in factory farms. They didn't need to change the cause area they worked on to feel like they could greatly improve the world.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Even_if_the_facts_were_true_the_underlying_argument_can_t_work\">Even if the facts were true the underlying argument can't work</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, even if it the claim were true, I don't think it could be a coherent argument against worrying about AI risk.</p>\n<p>The reason is this.</p>\n<p>Imagine the reverse were the case and it <em>wasn't</em>\u00a0the domain experts most qualified to work on the problem who thought\u00a0it was a big deal. Instead it was chefs, musicians and magazine copy editors who were most concerned. Would that be an argument <em>in favour</em> of worrying more, because such non-field experts could clearly have no self-serving bias that would cause them to worry?</p>\n<p>I don't think so. The concern of non-field experts is clearly <em>less</em> persuasive and I expect almost everyone would agree. Indeed, many people have claimed in the past that the fact that many computer scientists didn't seem so concerned was a good reason not to be worried.</p>\n<p>But if you want to say it's both unconvincing when field experts like computer scientists are concerned, and also unconvincing when non-field experts like farmers are concerned, congratulations: you've just made your view unresponsive to anyone else's judgement. That's a very bad place to be.</p>\n<p>In fact, computer scientists being concerned about artificial intelligence - and other relevant domain experts such as philosophers, mathematicians, brain scientists and machine learning experts -\u00a0is, on balance, the strongest piece of evidence available, because they are most likely to know what they are talking about.</p>\n<p>Finally, how could the situation ever be otherwise? It's natural that the first people to notice a new potential problem from a technology are domain experts, or at least people in adjacent domains. I bet the first people who sounded the alarm about potential threats from nuclear weapons were people who were close to relevant physics research. No one else could have been aware of the issue, or able to evaluate the merits of the arguments. I don't think the fact that physicists were initially the main group worried about the power of nuclear weapons would be a good reason to doubt them.</p>\n<div><strong>What biases might really create problems?</strong></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>The fact that the argument above doesn't work isn't evidence that AI really is a problem. The opposite of a wrong idea isn't a right one. Maybe there are other cognitive biases causing people to exaggerate the problem.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>For example, throughout history it has been widespread for people to believe they are living at a particularly crucial time in history, when either a huge disaster, or a revolution gain, could occur. Sometimes they are right (e.g. at the point when nuclear weapons were invented), but usually they have been wrong. People concerned with catastrophic risks call this 'Millenialist cognitive bias', <a href=\"http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/avoiding-millennialist-cognitive-biases\">discussed here</a>.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>But as is usually the case, when it comes to weighing artificial intelligence against other causes there are factors that could bias you both in favour of one view, and others that could bias you in favour of the other view. I don't find throwing potential biases at people you disagree with to be very helpful, unless you can get evidence about their relative magnitude.</div></div></div>"},

{"date": "30th Dec 2015", "title": "Why do effective altruists support the causes we do?", "author": "Michelle_Hutchinson", "num_comments": "15 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span>Effective altruism is most associated with three causes: global poverty, alleviating animal suffering and preventing existential risks. (Sometimes \u2018meta\u2019 is added to this list, but that seems more accurately characterised as a way to work on the other causes - more on that later.) Why this focus, given that there are so many other causes important to effective altruism (from political change to combating climate change) and that we should expect to continue finding more?</span></p>\n<p><span>I think the reason is that our current delineation of causes cuts along beneficiary lines: present humans, non-human animals, and future conscious beings. Some of the most significant insights of effective altruism in terms of finding more effective ways to help others have come from highlighting different beneficiary groups. Since the groups above seem to exhaust the space of beneficiaries (if what we care about is well-being), we can\u2019t expect to get more effectiveness improvements in this way. In future, such improvements will have to come from finding new interventions, or intervention types. These are harder to find, and likely to lead to fewer orders of magnitude improvement. This post is on how the current \u2018causes in EA\u2019 seem to arise from distinguishing beneficiary groups. In a follow up I\u2019ll discuss what the implications of that might be in terms of our likelihood of finding more effective causes.</span></p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span><span> </span></span></p>\n<p><span>\u2018Cause\u2019 is a very fuzzy term. If you think of the different things that we tend to talk about as causes, they actually seem to fall in different categories. Take the causes \u2018alleviating global poverty\u2019 and \u2018structural change\u2019. These are sometimes described as alternatives to each other, yet structural change seems more naturally a way to achieve the alleviation of poverty. This is likewise true of the cause \u2018meta\u2019. This fuzziness increases all the more what could fall into the category of \u2018causes we could be supporting\u2019, and makes it all the more surprising that there would be three singled out. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<h1 id=\"Distinguishing_groups_of_beneficiaries\"><span>Distinguishing groups of beneficiaries</span></h1>\n<p><span>The starting point of effective altruism is increasing well-being: not just of those close to and similar to us, but all over the world and into the future. EA activities therefore fall into three groups: helping </span><span>people currently existing</span><span>, helping </span><span>non-human animals</span><span>, and helping </span><span>future conscious beings</span><span>. This maps out the whole space of possible effective altruism activities. There are altruistic activities which fall outside this grouping \u2013 for example, working to improve biodiversity for its own sake. But these don\u2019t improve anyone\u2019s well-being, and so fall outside the scope of effective altruism.</span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span>There are other ways to group beneficiaries than the 3 categories above. You might distinguish simply between existing sentient beings and future sentient beings. Or you might draw finer distinctions, such as between non-human animals whose suffering is caused by humans and wild animals.</span></p>\n<p><span>There are several reasons for using the three-fold distinction amongst beneficiaries: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>The groups are systematically different in how much information we have about their cost-effectiveness: We have first-hand experience of how good it is to help other humans, while it\u2019s more difficult to know how to compare helping humans to helping other animals. Interventions that help others in the present can typically be tested for how well they work, unlike interventions aimed at the future.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>The kinds of things which will help the various groups will typically be somewhat more similar to each other than to those which help others of the groups. </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>These distinctions are typically drawn quite strongly in people\u2019s minds, and they represent different ways in which humanity\u2019s moral circle could do with being widened - to people spatially far away, to people temporally far away, and to species other than our own.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"From_beneficiaries_to_causes\"><span>From beneficiaries to causes</span></h2>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span>The three fold distinction amongst beneficiaries lines up with the three causes, </span></p>\n<p><span> still doesn\u2019t explain why we\u2019d focus on the particular causes \u00a0I started with. What additional assumptions lead to those causes predominating?</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<h3 id=\"Helping_people_who_currently_exist\"><span>Helping people who currently exist</span></h3>\n<p><span>\u2018Helping people who currently exist\u2019 is a broader aim than \u2018fighting extreme poverty\u2019. There are a large number of things which might be expected to help humanity \u2013 from finding really successful treatments for depression to curing aging to combating anti-biotic resistance. However, people discussing effective altruism often seem to equate helping current humanity and eradicating extreme poverty. We often take two statements as given: </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>P1: It is typically most effective to help those who are worst off </span></p>\n<p><span>P2: \u2018Fighting extreme poverty\u2019 should be understood in very broad terms.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Why accept P1?</span></p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span>There are different ways to define \u2018poverty\u2019, but as it is most usually used in effective altruism, it refers to something like global extreme poverty \u2013 living on less than US(2005)$1.25 purchasing power parity adjusted. Diminishing marginal returns means we should expect people who are poorer to be more cost-effective to help. Typically, the worse off someone is, the more likely it is that there are cheap things that can be done to help them (for example, providing deworming tablets). Once the low hanging fruit have been plucked, things that can be done to help them will be more expensive for the amount they help (for example, long-term chemotherapy treatments for cancer). People in extreme poverty are even more likely to benefit from very cost-effective interventions because the countries they live in typically lack basic infrastructure. All else equal, earning a similar amount (purchasing power parity adjusted) would be worse in, say, Sierra Leone than the UK, because in the UK you would be able to take advantage of the NHS and other such services.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>What do we mean by P2?</span></p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span>In some circles, \u2018alleviating extreme poverty\u2019 is understood in very specific terms \u2013 encompassing charitable interventions which increase people\u2019s income to more than $1.25 dollars/day. When discussing effective altruism, something much more general is meant \u2013 essentially helping those in extreme poverty as much as we can. That might be by charitable interventions which increase their income (like direct cash transfers). It might be by pushing policy changes such as trade liberalisation. It might be commercial ventures such as improving cell phone coverage (for example, mobile phones are very useful for farmers in order to check the prices at different local markets and work out where they should sell their crops). Combining this understanding of what alleviating poverty means with the premise that helping people who are worse off is usually more cost-effective than helping those who are better off leads to the conclusion that alleviating poverty is typically going to be the most effective way to help humanity in the present.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<h3 id=\"Helping_non_human_animals\"><span>Helping non-human animals</span></h3>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span>The second cause is sometimes phrased \u2018alleviating animal suffering\u2019 and sometimes as \u2018animal rights\u2019. I assume that these are used largely interchangeably: that protecting the rights of animals focuses on protecting their right not to be harmed. These concepts are already fairly broad, but it is not quite as broad as \u2018increasing the well-being of non-human animals\u2019. If helping non-human animals as much as we can is to entail working on the cause of reducing non-human animal suffering Premise 3 must be true: </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>P3: The most effective way to help animals will typically be to decrease their suffering, rather than increase their enjoyment. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>There may be some interventions currently being implemented which increase the enjoyment of animals</span><span>, and even more plausibly there might research being done into ways to increase animal\u2019s well-being set-point. But it still seems very plausible that it is currently more effective to decrease the suffering of animals in the world.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<h3 id=\"Helping_future_sentient_beings\"><span>Helping future sentient beings</span></h3>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span><span> </span></span><span>\u2018Mitigating existential risks\u2019, as with the other two causes, is somewhat broader than it initially sounds. You might classify the risks into three categories:</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Extinction risks:</strong> events which would wipe out all conscious future beings. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Eternal loss:</strong> events which cause the loss of most of the future value of the universe but without wiping out conscious beings \u2013 for example, an event which wipes out most humans and puts us back to the level of technology before the industrial revolution. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Unrealised eternal gains:</strong> failure to take advantage of huge opportunities for value in the future \u2013 for example, staying on Earth if we could have colonised the galaxy (if we thought that doing so was a good thing).</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span><span> </span></span><span>You might wonder whether mitigating existential risks really captures everything that can be done to help future creatures. The most important distinction to draw amongst ways of helping the future is between irrevocable future alterations and non-irrevocable alterations. That is to say \u2013 changes which persist in the world, versus changes which lead to a world which only temporarily differs from the alternative. For example, perhaps if we increase investment to fighting malaria, we can eradicate malaria in 2030. It seems plausible to me that as we\u2019re currently going, we will eradicate malaria, but not until later on \u2013 perhaps 2070. This is a non-irrevocable change in the world: our work meant that the world was malaria free for 40 extra years. On the other side, a pandemic which killed all humans would be something that we could not recover from, and therefore be entirely irrevocable. \u2018X-risks\u2019 is intended to capture changes in the world that are largely or entirely irrevocable. Mitigating x-risks would be the best way to help future sentient creatures if P4 were true: </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>P4: We should focus on irrevocable rather than revocable future changes.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Why accept P4?</span></p>\n<p><span>All else equal, the longer the change you made in the world persists for, the bigger the value change you\u2019ve caused. Our highest leverage opportunities, therefore, are going to come from changes that are entirely irrevocable. Therefore, we should expect preventing irrevocable future changes for the worse to be the highest impact way we have of helping the future.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>This reasoning seems to make it a bit more explicable why effective altruism is often said to concentrate on just three causes. It can also give us some insight into the likelihood of our finding even more effective causes. </span></p>\n<div><span><br></span></div>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "22nd Dec 2015", "title": "EA Interview Series: Michelle Hutchinson, December 2015", "author": "thebestwecan", "num_comments": "6 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span>The effective altruism community is full of kind </span></p>\n<p><span>and <img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/KxpXRWU.jpg\" alt=\"\"></span><span><span>thoughtful individuals. </span>It's also a community that relies heavily on thoughtful and </span><span>constructive criticism as a necessary tool for continuously improving ourselves and our charitable efforts. But this can lead to an overrepresentation of negativity, so it\u2019s important to pause sometimes and reflect on our achievements thus far, to support our friends who are doing incredible things in fundraising, research, philanthropy, direct work, and other areas. It also helps to\u00a0</span><span>give </span></p>\n<p><span>newcomers to effective altruism a personal </span></p>\n<p><span>understanding of our community.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>In these interviews, we plan on highlighting the amazing efforts of people in the effective altruism community. The first individual we\u2019ll feature is Michelle Hutchinson, executive director of </span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\"><span>Giving What We Can (GWWC)</span></a><span>, part of the </span><a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\"><span>Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA)</span></a><span>. GWWC was one of the first organizations created explicitly as part of effective altruism and has remained a cornerstone of our community. One of their most straightforward measures of their accomplishment is the </span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/dashboard\"><span>average number of new members per month</span></a><span>:</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>2013 - 10 </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>2014 - 35 </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>2015 - 53 (up to the end of November)</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><span><span><br></span></span></div>\n<p><span>GWWC might not get as much attention these days as some other groups, but Michelle has brought together an amazing team and served as a tremendous leader in the broader EA community. It\u2019s unlikely that GWWC would have been as successful without her help. We spoke with her to find out more about her incredible work.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>How did you become involved with effective altruism and find your current position at Giving What We Can?</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>While studying at Oxford, I got to know Will Crouch [now Will MacAskill] and Toby Ord who were considering setting up Giving What We Can. I had done some charity work before, but hadn\u2019t really known where to give or where to volunteer. The idea was that we could choose between those opportunities by asking which would help people the most and actually find an answer to that was really exciting to me, and I immediately wanted to help with the project. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>At first I was doing research, then I ended up coordinating the research volunteers. It turned out I really enjoyed coordinating a team. Later on I became Director of Operations (in part because I was interested in finances, and we assumed that came under operations!). At that point, 80,000 Hours was starting up, and we soon realized that Giving What We Can and 80k were both getting to sufficient size that we needed to professionalize and hire staff. We planned to set up one legal unit to house both. At the time, we were thinking we really just needed a name for legal purposes, so we decided on \u201cCentre for Effective Altruism\u201d even though \u201ceffective altruism\u201d seemed like a somewhat cumbersome phrase (though decidedly better than the placeholder \u2018High Impact Alliance\u2019!). It was quite a surprise to us how popular that name turned out to be! (Though Mark Lee very much anticipated it.) </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I really enjoyed running Operations - learning how companies and charities operate, how to hire staff etc. When we started as full-time staff I became Executive Director of Giving What We Can, taking over from Will, which has been a whole new challenge. The main similarity though is it still being a primarily management role, which greatly suits me. </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>The decision between research and other forms of direct work comes up pretty often in effective altruism career decisions. Do you feel more naturally inclined towards operations work or did you enjoy it more because it was important work that needed to be done?</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I only took it up because that was what was needed (I\u2019m pretty academic by nature), but I ended up finding it very satisfying. I\u2019m very much a team person, so I liked supporting other people on their various roles. I see my current role as manager of the Giving What We Can team as much the same kind of thing - facilitating the work of my team, and making sure they have everything they need to flourish.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Would you say that\u2019s what really inspires you in your work, helping others on your team do the best they can?</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>On a day-to-day level, it\u2019s really the people around me that keep me motivated - people who work so hard, are so smart, and care so much. I just found it amazing finding people like Toby, Will and Andreas who care so much and do such good work. That\u2019s still how I feel about the new people joining us - whether new members of Giving What We Can or new CEA staff. In the really early days what got me to late night events full of new people (I\u2019m rather shy!) was knowing that Holly would want me to go; now what keeps me working hard even when it\u2019s late and I\u2019m tired is knowing that Sam is still in the office coding, or that Jon\u2019s out giving a talk at a chapter right now. </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Definitely lots of people in the effective altruism community are very hard-working. Do you feel under pressure to work longer hours? How do you weigh the balance between working long into the night and potentially burning yourself out?</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Thankfully, the people at CEA are very supportive and recognize that everyone is different. Some people are happy to work really long hours, for others evenings and weekends are sacred. Some are happy to live extremely frugally, others find a nicer house important to them or need to save for the future; some are v*gan, for others that isn\u2019t the right choice at the moment. There are so many dimensions on which we could optimise that it would just be too easy to cause each other burn out. Thankfully, everyone at CEA is really accepting of each other\u2019s limits. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>My main bottleneck on working hours is stress. Some weeks I happily work long hours. Others I get stressed out and need to take more time off (preferably going for walks or watching </span><span>Gilmore Girls</span><span>). I\u2019m lucky enough to be surrounded by people who think that\u2019s totally fine. I also get a lot of support, not just from within the Giving What We Can team, but also from others in CEA - whether that\u2019s advice from the trustees whenever I need it, or emotional support from Rob (he\u2019s my mentor within CEA, and as such has to put up with rather a lot!). </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>What\u2019s your day-to-day work like? Is there a particular task you really like doing and maybe one that you don\u2019t enjoy as much?</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>It\u2019s variable throughout the year. Sometimes, recruiting really takes up a lot of my time, sometimes fundraising does. Strategy and planning is always a large part of my role - whether reviewing how effective particular activities were, or planning future ones.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>The things I like most are those that involve managing people. Whether that\u2019s having individual meetings or reviewing work that my team has done, I relish it because it\u2019s fundamentally about helping each other. It\u2019s all the more rewarding because my staff do such great work!</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I\u2019m much less keen on fundraising. It\u2019s a lot like asking your friends for money, knowing that if they don\u2019t actually come through on the money, you won\u2019t be able to pay salaries, which has the ultimate outcome of people having malaria or not receiving deworming (though I try hard not to think of it in those terms because that makes it far too stressful!). </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Who are some of your role models, in effective altruism or other areas?</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>It\u2019s so difficult to pick - I\u2019m in the really fortunate position of being surrounded by people I hugely admire. In the early days of CEA, I couldn\u2019t get over the fact that a significant part of our budget was paid for by Julia donating the money she earned working as a social worker in a prison (which sounds pretty terrifying to me, although I think she felt otherwise!). Likewise, some of our members earn huge salaries, yet live on very little in order to donate almost all of it. I think it\u2019s wonderful that there are people in the world as generous as those I get to correspond with on a daily basis. More of a personal inspiration to me is Ben Todd, executive director of 80,000 Hours. We have been doing similar jobs for years in different organizations, and he\u2019s always been a model for me in terms of how he manages people, how well he puts together strategy and how calm he stays regardless of the situation. Watching what he\u2019s done with 80,000 Hours is inspiring, and despite his focus on and dedication to that he is always the first to provide help whenever Giving What We Can needs any. </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span><span>That\u2019s so nice of you to say. </span>What is your vision for both your personal career and GWWC or EA as a whole?</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I\u2019m very excited about both figuring out how to do the most good and building a community of support around that goal (as well as providing practicalities like shared information on how to give tax efficiently and services for doing so as easily as possible). It was being surrounded by people putting their money where their mouth was that moved me from thinking I ought to donate significantly but probably never would, to feeling that it was the default to give 10%. I really want to give other people that opportunity to live up to their ideals, and I think that GWWC is in a good position to do that. Having such a big community doing it shows that giving 10% isn\u2019t the big deal I once thought it was. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span><span>I hope that in this way, GWWC can help to unify the effective altruism movement, and help it demonstrate to the world at large the impact it can have. Effective altruism faces risks at both extremes - it could seem like this unachievable thing that\u2019s way too extreme for the average person, or it could get so watered down that it ceases to mean anything but trying to sound smart on the internet. By all standing solidly behind a call to action which is significant but achievable to most people in rich countries, we can hopefully make sure that enthusiasm translates to impact.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>In the long run, I\u2019d like effective altruism being so common it\u2019s taken for granted, like vegetarianism already is. People used to attend vegetarian support groups to meet other people with their view of the world - that now feels amusingly redundant in places like the UK. I hope the same will happen for giving 10%, and that in the future when people are choosing where to donate or what job to get it will be the default to consider which option has the most social impact. Likewise, I look forward to a future where key decision makers, whether that be politicians or institutions like the World Bank, will automatically make their decisions with reference to how to do the most good.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Thanks for your time, Michelle. I really admire you and all the great work you\u2019ve done, especially in bringing together such a great team at CEA. Just to let readers know, CEA is running its </span><a href=\"/ea/qn/cea_is_launching_a_winter_fundraising_round/\"><span>winter fundraiser</span></a><span> until the end of the month.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><br><br><span>The EA Interview Series is currently produced by Jacy Reese, research associate at Animal Charity Evaluators, and Nicole Ross, operations associate at GiveWell. Disclaimer: the views expressed above are those of Michelle, Jacy, and Nicole, not their employers. We hope to continue producing one interview each month, as a way to highlight the incredible work being done in our community. There\u2019s a good chance the people running this project will change over time as people have shifting availabilities. </span></p></div></div>"},

{"date": "8th Nov 2015", "title": "(Publicly) Introducing the Local Effective Altruism Network", "author": "Tom_Ash", "num_comments": "2 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Local EA groups play an invaluable role. They\u2019re where much outreach and fundraising happens. They make people aware of effective altruism and strengthen their commitment to it. There are <a href=\"http://eahub.org/groups\">dozens of local EA groups</a> around the world from Auckland to Vancouver, with hundreds of truly dedicated people working on them. As part of their common mission, these groups share knowledge and resources with one another, though a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/localea/\">Facebook group</a>, <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/%23!forum/ea-group-leaders\">mailing list</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/localea/events/\">conference calls</a>, <a href=\"http://eahub.org/groups/resources/newsletter\">newsletter</a>, <a href=\"http://wiki.effectivealtruismhub.com/index.php?title%3DLocal_groups\">wiki</a> and other such channels.</p>\n<p>A small but growing team under .impact has been working on connecting, supporting and growing this network of groups. Our project is called the <a href=\"http://eahub.org/groups/network\">Local Effective Altruism Network</a>, or LEAN for short. It follows .impact\u2019s general model in providing a decentralised, transparent and open way for groups to help one another while maintaining their autonomy. Several local organizers around the world have got involved, sharing resources and knowledge with other groups in the network and providing support. For example, we\u2019ve worked with Peter McIntyre of Sydney\u2019s <a href=\"http://eaunsw.org/\">EA UNSW</a> to build <a href=\"http://eahub.org/groups/get-a-website\">free websites for local groups</a>, for which we provide hosting using .impact\u2019s web server, and buy domain names using LEAN funds.</p>\n<p>Our broad team includes many other such volunteers from groups around the world who want to use the experience and skills that they\u2019ve built up to help EA outreach elsewhere. <a href=\"mailto:lean@effectivealtruismhub.com\">Get in touch</a> if you\u2019d like to do this too - or we encourage you to use the network channels directly if you have a specific idea or offer, while still also dropping us a line. The most reliable way to reach all local groups is to send us an item to include in the <a href=\"http://eahub.org/groups/resources/newsletter\">newsletter</a> that we send to all their organizers.</p>\n<p>We also have a small team coordinating work, providing support themselves, and doing what\u2019s required to run LEAN as a lean organization. We began in January by <a href=\"/ea/ff/creating_a_local_effective_altruist_presence_in/\">recruiting people</a> to do local outreach in cities and countries without an existing EA presence, through which method we have seeded 80 groups; some already quite active. Back then relatively little other work was being done with local groups, but their importance and value is increasingly being recognised; we <a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/Coordination-of-chapter-creation-and-support-lg0geRIiGrH\">coordinate</a> our work with other EA organisations now working on this. This naturally required a \u2018central\u2019 team, but we\u2019ve since expanded our focus to growing and supporting these and other groups in their endeavours to do counterfactual good. In this we\u2019ve continued the work of THINK, the initial organisation focused on local groups at the dawn of effective altruism thus-named at 2012, which we are an official successor of.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re lucky to have some very dedicated people on both the \u2018central\u2019 LEAN team and the broader team across the whole network of groups. Listing them all would be impossible, but that\u2019s no reason not to thank a few, such as <a href=\"http://eahub.org/user/max\">Max Carpendale</a>, <a href=\"http://eahub.org/user/ben-clifford\">Ben Clifford</a>, Richenda Herzig, (board level watchdog), <a href=\"http://eahub.org/user/peter-mcintyre\">Peter McIntyre</a>, <a href=\"http://eahub.org/user/alex-richard\">Alex Richard</a>, <a href=\"http://eahub.org/user/brian-tse\">Brian Tse</a>, <a href=\"http://eahub.org/user/peter-hurford\">Peter Hurford</a> (a board level watchdog), and last but not least  <a href=\"http://eahub.org/user/marcus-davis\">Marcus Davis</a> (now sadly departed to coding bootcamp after many months of work, including two with me in Vancouver). Thanks are of course also due to everyone else who\u2019s helped - and most of all to those involved in the local groups themselves, who do the lion\u2019s share of outreach work and to whom the credit for it belongs.</p>\n<p><em>-- Tom Ash, currently serving as project lead.

The aim of this     research is to be able to found a charity that is good enough to be recommended by GiveWell.</p>\n<p>Please criticise this idea.</p>\n<p>We think it is a good idea to check whether the EA community sees problems with this idea. Many eyes see more than a dozen. We want this idea to be thrown     away if it\u2019s not good or improved if it is improve-worthy. Please criticise it if you feel that the idea of founding a charity is not great, or if you     think our plan to get there (set out in the rest of this post) is not great, then criticise that.</p>\n<p><span>The idea:</span></p>\n<p>Sam Hilton, some others and I have recently expressed interest in founding a charity that is good enough to be recommended by GW.</p>\n<p><span>Our reasons:</span></p>\n<p>We think that this project has high expected utility.</p>\n<p>There is a small chance that we could find a highly effective intervention and could create a charity that is better than any of the existing top     recommended GW charities.</p>\n<p>More likely we think that as the EA community grows then the room for more funding for GiveWell's current top recommended charities will shrink. Even if it     is relatively easy for GiveWell's current top charities to expand to other countries and they may find that the effectiveness of their interventions is lower in those countries. (Details on SCI\u2019s funding gap can be found    <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-03-31/charity-update-ii-schistosomiasis-control-initiative-sci\"> <span>here</span></a>. AMF has previously     lost its top spot due to limited room for more funding. We are assuming that GiveDirectly has a larger room for funding but is slightly less effective than     AMF and SCI and DtW.)</p>\n<p>We recognise the existence of organisations that scale up effective interventions, such as Evidence Action, but believe that there is a benefit to even     more work in this area.</p>\n<p><span>Step one \u2013 research:</span></p>\n<p>We want some research into which global poverty interventions are potentially highly promising. We want to look for interventions that have some evidence     behind them but where there is no charity working in this area (or no good effectiveness focused charity in that area, or no charity solely in that area).</p>\n<p>We want to compile a public list of promising interventions. This list should be a tool that anyone keen to start a global poverty charity can look at and     choose an intervention to start. It should list promising global poverty interventions some analysis and comparison of the different ideas. It should     include both promising ideas that could be better than GW\u2019s top recommended charities, as well as a no-go list of promising sounding ideas that can be     dismissed as not worth starting following some initial research.</p>\n<p>We envisage the process of generating ideas to fill out the list to be primarily through talking to existing research organisations in this area (beginning     with GiveWell and including GW, GWWC, JPAL, IPA, DCP, Evidence Action, Centre for Global Development, Copenhagen Consensus, and so on) and asking if they     have come across any promising high impact interventions.</p>\n<p>Once a list of intervention ideas is compiled the next step would be to do further analysis of each intervention. This could be carried out by talking to     the aforementioned organisations again in more detail, talking to experts in the fields and doing literature reviews.</p>\n<p>We are currently looking to provide funding for GWWC to take on an intern to do this research.</p>\n<p><span>Step two \u2013 more research:</span></p>\n<p>The list is complete, so we choose an intervention to start. If the intervention is not currently supported by a large body of research then we want to     fund/carry out a randomized controlled trial to test whether it\u2019s worth pursuing this intervention.</p>\n<p><span>Step three \u2013 found a new charity</span></p>\n<p>How hard can it be ...?</p>\n<p>So before you close this page, give us your feedback, even if it is just a score out of 10 in the comments below for how much you like this idea.

{"date": "11th Jan 2015", "title": "Why I Don't Account for Moral Uncertainty", "author": null, "num_comments": "16 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>A popular notion for some people interested in effective altruism is <a href=\"http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/research-topics/ethics/moral-uncertainty.html\">moral uncertainty</a><sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is much disagreement by intelligent people over what it is right to do, and while we each have our own beliefs about the matter, it would be foolish to be 100% certain that we are correct while all these others are not. Until further evidence is in, or until much wider consensus is reached, the only rational approach is to spread your degrees of belief between different ethical theories.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I find this notion unconvincing because I view morality as subjective. For example, if I believe bribery is wrong and someone else believes it's morally acceptable, I think neither of us is (in)correct. Instead, we simply differ in our moral preferences, similarly to how I might think apples are tasty while someone else thinks they're gross. This view is sufficient to reject the notion of moral uncertainty described above, but there are at least two ways we can plausibly attempt to preserve the conclusion that we should accommodate alternative moral frameworks in our decision-making.</p>\n<p>First, although it seems to me very unlikely and even incomprehensible to have a correct<sup>2</sup>\u00a0morality, one that is objective true independent of whose perspective we use, the existence of a correct morality (this belief is often called\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_moral_realism.html\">moral realism</a>) is an empirical belief so I do accept a <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/why-the-modesty-argument-for-moral-realism-fails/\">modesty argument</a><sup>1 </sup>for its possibility.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Start with the premise of</p>\n<p><span> </span><em>Nonrealist Nihilism</em>: If moral realism is false, then nothing matters.</p>\n<p>Now, suppose you think the probability of moral realism is P. Then when you consider taking some action, the expected value of the action is</p>\n<p><span> </span>P * (value if moral realism is true) + (1-P) * (value if moral realism is false)</p>\n<p><span> </span>= P * (value if moral realism is true) + (1-P) * 0</p>\n<p>where the substitution with 0 follows from the Nonrealist Nihilism premise. Therefore, we can prudentially assume that moral realism is true.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this link above, Brian Tomasik points out some good reasons for rejecting this argument. But even given the argument holds, moral realism seems so weird and incomprehensible that I see no reason to prefer any possible moral realisms (e.g. utilitarianism, libertarianism) over any other, so each possible moral realism is canceled out by an equally likely opposite realism (e.g. utilitarianism says happiness is good, but anti-utilitarianism says happiness is bad so these cancel out) and the argument fails.</p>\n<p>The second rescue of moral uncertainty is more tenable and, as far as I know, was first formalized by Ruair\u00ed Donnelly. We can call it\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ruairidonnelly.com/moral-uncertainty/\">anti-realist moral uncertainty</a>. This is how I'd describe this idea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I accept some uncertainty in what my future self will morally value. If I am a utilitarian today, I accept I might not be a utilitarian tomorrow. Therefore, I choose to give some weight to these future values.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I, personally, choose not to account for the values of my future self in my moral decisions. If I did, I might expect my future values to be more similar to the average human morality. So, it seems to be simply a matter of personal preference. I think this reframing of moral uncertainty makes sense, even if I don't see reason that I should adopt it.<br><br>Lastly, it is important to note that even without accommodating for moral uncertainty, there are still <a href=\"http://foundational-research.org/publications/reasons-to-be-nice-to-other-value-systems/\">good reasons</a> to cooperate with people whose value systems differ from our own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>[1] I am not sure who first came up with these two terms (moral uncertainty and the modesty argument), so I just used the most frequently used write-ups I know of for each term.</p>\n<p>[2] By correct, I mean correct in the way it is correct that the sky is blue.</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "25th Jan 2015", "title": "Dorothea Brooke: an alternative origin story for Effective Altruism", "author": "Bernadette_Young", "num_comments": "19 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><strong>Summary:</strong> A potential criticism or weakness of effective altruism is that it appeals only to a narrow spectrum of society, and exhibits a \u2018monoculture\u2019 of ideas. I introduce Dorothea Brooke, a literary character who I argue was an advocate for the principles of effective altruism -- as early as 1871 -- in a Christian ethical tradition. Rather than being of mere historic interest, I hope this will inform ideas for a wider and more inclusive conception of the philosophy of effective altruism. This is a contribution to the January blogging carnival theme \u2018Origin Stories\u2019</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Background__the_key_elements_of_effective_altruism_\">Background: the key elements of effective altruism </strong></p>\n<p>Many prominent figures in the movement are utilitarian philosophers, and the key principles of the movement are often placed in a tradition of utilitarian thought. The first key principle of this movement -- to do great good in the world, regardless of our personal ties to those who benefit -- does follow from utilitarian ethics but it is not unique to utilitarianism. Many major religions declare it a duty to help others, particularly those most in need: tithing, or giving a proportion of one's income, is a Sikh principle as well as is a tradition in the Abrahamic religions. The writings of St Thomas Aquinas and St Basil of Caesarea argue the radical alleviation of poverty is a key duty in Christianity.</p>\n<p>The second key element of effective altruism -- using evidence and knowledge to inform our efforts -- is a newer concept. For effective altruists it is not enough simply to aim to do good: we acknowledge a duty to do as much good as our resources allow, and to support our choices with evidence. The history of 'Evidence Based Medicine' is an interesting analogy here: for though physicians have clearly sought to improve health for millennia, it was only the latter part of the 20th century that the clear and conscientious application of evidence to clinical practice became widespread. The very idea now seems self-evident, so it is worth remembering that what is now standard practice has been contested -- sometimes bitterly -- over the last 50 years. The fear of doctors that \u2018cook-book medicine\u2019 would undermine their ability to exercise clinical judgment, and 'result in reducing the autonomy of the doctor/patient relationship'[1] resembles the argument of those who believe the wide application of metrics to philanthropy threatens the altruistic urge behind the act of giving, leaving the giver 'coolly looking across humanity as a detached god'[2] [a]. Effective altruism argues that reason is a product of rather than a threat to our altruism: it arises from our recognition of breadth and depth of suffering that exists, and the great variability we observe between the actions we may take to relieve or prevent that suffering. The seriousness with which we treat that potential good our actions can create is what motivates us to seek good evidence for our decisions.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"A_new_idea_\">A new idea?</strong></p>\n<p>Many of us -- myself included -- would have said that this practice of conscientiously applying scientific rigour to altruistic acts is what makes the effective altruism movement new and different This is why I was so surprised to find an advocate, albeit fictional, of both key principles of effective altruism dating back over a century, but such a figure exists in Dorothea Brooke, of George Eliot's novel 'Middlemarch'.</p>\n<p>Published in 1871, but set in 1830-2, Eliot's novel explores the life of a manufacturing town and surrounding countryside in the years leading up to the Great Reform Bill in Britain. At the heart of the novel is Dorothea. An orphan, recently returned from school to live with her uncle, she has some independent wealth and will inherit more if she has a son. Seeing that she has been narratively gifted with wealth, beauty and good parentage, to any reader of nineteenth century fiction it should be clear that Dorothea's plot arc will concern romance and end in matrimony. Confounding expectation and confusing her relations, Dorothea defies convention by devoting her time to improving the lot of others, in the most effective way she can.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Dorothea_s_evidence_based_altruism\">Dorothea\u2019s evidence based altruism</strong></p>\n<p>Altruism is at the core of Dorothea's life, both her words and her deeds. \u2018What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult to each other?\u2019 From our first introduction to her we see her actively pursuing opportunities to do so, with a sense of obligation and of moral urgency: \u2018I think we deserve to be beaten out of our beautiful houses with a scourge of small cords -- all of us who let tenants live in such sties as we see round us.\u2019 Her altruism is not a luxury, or a hobby to fill her time. It is so central that it remains with and sustains her when her circumstances have become unhappy:</p>\n<p><em></em></p>\n<p><em>\u2018If we had lost our own chief good, other people's good would remain, and that is worth trying for. Some can be happy. I seemed <span> </span>to see that more clearly than ever, when I was the most wretched. I can hardly think how I could have borne the trouble, if that <span> </span>feeling had not come to me to make strength </em> \u2019</p>\n<p>Thus she explains the benefits of altruism to an individual: the good of others matters just as much as our own, and increasing the well-being of others gives us a consciousness of having improved total welfare, even if we do not share in it directly.</p>\n<p>Dorothea's sense of duty is rooted firmly in her Christianity. Religion is a very serious matter to Dorothea: her sense of the importance of her God and the preeminence of the spiritual such that she refuses to wear a necklace of her mother's, an heirloom, because she feels that to decorate a cross with jewels is to trivialise it. Her religion does not simply require ascetic self denial or self perfection, but rather looks outward:</p>\n<p><em></em></p>\n<p><em><span> </span>\u2018I have always been thinking of the different ways in which Christianity is taught, and whenever I find one way that makes it a <span> </span>wider blessing than any other, I cling to that as the truest -- I mean that which takes in the most good of all kinds, and brings in <span> </span>the most people as sharers in it.\u2019 </em></p>\n<p>This expression resonates with Peter Singer's concept of 'The Expanding Circle' of moral concern (an idea that he attributes to WH Lecky in the late nineteenth century).[3]</p>\n<p>What sets Dorothea apart is the zeal with which she pursues education and evidence with the explicit goal of informing her actions and maximising their impact. Dorothea seeks knowledge because she believes there is an answer about what it is best to do: \u2018I am often unable to decide. But that is from ignorance. The right conclusion is there all he same, though I am unable to see it. \u2018 We find her at her desk pursuing what appears to be an early version of the Giving What We Can research team!</p>\n<p><em></em></p>\n<p><em><span> </span>'She sat down in the library before her particular little heap of books on political economy and kindred matters, out of which she <span> </span>was trying to get light as to the best way of spending money so as not to injure one's neighbours, or--what comes to the same <span> </span>thing--so as to do them the most good.' </em></p>\n<p>This sentence has an astounding resonance with the effective altruism project: the use of resources to help others is necessarily informed by politics and economy, and there is no demarcation in her impact between doing 'the most good' and avoiding harm. Moreover she also considers the benefits of experimentation to increase knowledge in the sphere of philanthropy. She exhorts her uncle to support his tenants by experimentation with farming methods. He decries the cost of this 'hobby' -- \u2018the most expensive sort of whistle you can buy\u2019, and she rebukes him -- \u2018It is not a sin to make yourself poor in performing experiments for the good of all.\u2019</p>\n<p><strong id=\"An_unsuccessful_project\">An unsuccessful project</strong></p>\n<p>Simply having these goals does not ensure Dorothea achieves the kind of impact she hopes to have. She faces a number of challenges. Firstly her own uncertainty: \u2018I don't feel sure about doing good in any way now: everything seems like going on a mission to a people whose language I don't know.\u2019 Secondly, her family find her ideas alien and even unseemly. Her uncle (and guardian) copes with his oddity of a niece by ignoring her suggestions for how he could improve the lives and homes of his tenants, while her sister admonishes her for her 'notions'. This sister even considers encouraging her to channel her oddity into a more conventional course by marrying the local squire who would 'let her manage everything and carry out all her notions.' (This might be considered an early version of earning to give for a nineteenth century gentlewoman!)</p>\n<p>She is frequently stymied by the power structures of the era. As a woman she is excluded from higher education despite her zeal for learning. She marries a scholar, thinking that by helping him she will be advancing the light of knowledge in the world and become more learned herself, but later discovers his studies are a failure, pursuing answers to questions long deemed irrelevant in his field. (He is unable to admit this, but instead attempts to extract a vow from her to pursue his fruitless enquiry after his death.) She is thwarted by her status, firstly an unmarried woman, and later a married one. Dorothea's altruistic plans for direct philanthropy depend upon having resources, but her ability to own and dispose of property is curtailed. She will only inherit her uncle's property if she has a son. When her husband dies, she finds his property willed to her but constrained by an injunction against remarriage. In the end Dorothea's impact is limited to a sort of political influence, when she marries a writer with political ambition: \u2018Dorothea could have liked nothing better, since wrongs existed, than that her husband should be in the thick of a struggle against them, and that she should give him wifely help.\u2019</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Doomed_or_unlucky_\">Doomed or unlucky?</strong></p>\n<p>Her altruistic project has clearly failed her early ambition: our author declares it 'a pity that so substantive and rare a creature should have been absorbed into the life of another, and be only known in a certain circle as a wife and mother.' As modern readers, we might dismiss the importance of authorial intent, but I think the framing of this narrative is key in whether we interpret Dorothea as a flawed character set forth to fail or as victim of circumstances. I would argue there is strong suggestion in the novel to the second of these.</p>\n<p>In the prologue and conclusion which frame this sweeping novel, Dorothea's story is contrasted with Saint Theresa, another woman whose 'passionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life\u2026the rapturous consciousness of life beyond self'. While Theresa founded a religious order, Dorothea finds no 'epic life' and is eulogised as a 'foundress of nothing' whose efforts 'are dispersed among hindrances, instead of centring in some long-recognisable deed.' In particular it is the lack of opportunity for a woman in the age to act that is presented as her chief \u2018hindrance\u2019: our impartial narrator states \u2018no one stated exactly what else that was in her power she ought rather to have done\u2019. But it is the obstacles, not her nature which are found to be at fault by this narrator, for her society has provided 'no coherent social faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge for the ardently willing soul.'</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Why_is_she_important_\">Why is she important?</strong></p>\n<p>Dorothea is a remarkable proponent of effective altruism for many reasons.</p>\n<p>Firstly I am particularly pleased to be able to draw attention to her as the female creation of a female writer, who makes as strong an argument for our ideas as I've seen in the nineteenth century. Women currently constitute much less than half of the numbers in effective altruism organisations and discussions, which may be surprising when women just as (or even more) likely as men to think giving is important and to donate to charity[5,6]. In discussing this skew, some people have argued that the relatively small number of women in EA arise from women being innately or culturally less likely to hold these views. Consider instead that women are less likely to be found in the places where the movement has had much of its momentum, in philosophy departments and rationalist internet communities. Rather than restricting efforts to these spheres, I would argue there is low hanging fruit to be found in seeking other communities who will engage enthusiastically with our endeavours.</p>\n<p>This doesn't just mean engaging women, but engaging a plurality of moral theories. It would be a great mistake to believe that effective altruism belongs only or mostly to utilitarianism. I've tried to make a case here for why EA may arise naturally out of Christian morality, a phenomenon that has been observed elsewhere [6,7]. While many influential people within effective altruism stress that it needn\u2019t rest on utilitarian foundations, this is still a very common misconception and more could be done to show how it can have a much wider appeal, including encouraging more voices that come to effective altruism from these other foundations</p>\n<p>Finally, through Dorothea's story Eliot is able to explore a number of barriers to the success of these ideas: a lack of education or evidence to put them into action; a lack of shared community to explore ideas; the opposition of friends and family. We can learn from the failure of Dorothea's projects, and fortify ourselves against these pitfalls, to avoid her 'tragic failure, which found no sacred poet and sank unwept into oblivion.'</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Larissa MacFarquhar, Toby Ord and Michelle Hutchinson for comments on an earlier draft</em></p>\n<p><strong id=\"References_and_footnotes_\">References and footnotes:</strong></p>\n<p>[Unless otherwise specified, quotations are from George Eliot <em>Middlemarch</em> 1871-2]</p>\n<p>[1] Aaron Michael Cohen, P.

Perhaps you\u2019re a 20-something single male, and an ad for a Cadillac minivan, touting how many kids it could fit, came on the air. Or maybe you\u2019re a vegetarian, health-focused mother and as you read a magazine you saw an ad showing just how much meat there is in Wendy\u2019s burgers, since they \u2018don\u2019t cut corners.\u2019</p>\n<p>Think back to how you felt after seeing that ad. Think about how you felt about the company being advertised. It\u2019s likely that you didn\u2019t have much of an opinion about them before, or at least didn\u2019t spend much time thinking about them or forming your opinion\u2026 we usually don\u2019t.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But afterward?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Chances are after seeing the ad, you felt worse about the company. Maybe if you\u2019d ever been in the market for a luxury car (ok, we\u2019re EAs, bad example, but whatever) you\u2019d consider a sleek Cadillac, but then that ad would automatically come to mind, and you\u2019d think maybe you ought to go for a luxury brand that doesn\u2019t also make a minivan. Perhaps if you were the health-focused, vegetarian mother, and your kids had said they wanted a Wendy\u2019s McFlurry, you would have occasionally acquiesced as a treat. Now though, there\u2019s an increased likelihood of you having a recoil reaction at the sound of Wendy\u2019s, and recommending Dairy Queen instead.</p>\n<p>These examples are meant to demonstrate a single point, the awareness of which seems to be all too often lacking in the EA community: <span>People exposed to a pitch, but not interested or compelled by it, are most often subsequently turned off.</span></p>\n<p>As you\u2019d expect, someone who\u2019s turned off is much more difficult to convince than someone who\u2019s never heard of you. They have developed the heuristic of your company/idea = not interested, so they most often don\u2019t take the time/attention to reevaluate it when further exposed.</p>\n<p>For this reason, well-strategized new ventures, products, pitches, ideas and more follow the game plan of avoiding too significant of attention until they\u2019ve put significant, well-strategized effort behind maximizing their conversion rate.</p>\n<p>Conversion rate is simple. It is the number of people who take your desired action divided by the total number of people exposed to your message.</p>\n<p>The highly simplified, informed approach to growing a company, spreading an idea, or whatever is:</p>\n<p><span> </span>1. Gather and keep gathering enough attention so that you have meaningful sample sizes.</p>\n<p><span> </span>2. Test your idea/product/message, measure the results. Make a change to try to improve, measure if it works, repeat. Go through <span> </span>tons of these iterations. Continue until anything major you think of doesn\u2019t seem to affect your conversion rate in a highly <span> </span>significant positive way.</p>\n<p><span> </span>3. Then, and only then, get mass attention. Throw fuel on that fire. Run the conversion machine to spit out people taking the <span> </span>actions you want! (Note: You\u2019ve exhausted all the big changes you can think of, within reason, but you continue to do step 2 with <span> </span>less major differences).</p>\n<p>I claim, that unfortunately, EA has done little to maximize conversion rates, and much to grab attention. We went to step 3 without nearly enough time on step 2.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Think about the enormous amount of press, YouTube views, book sales, etc. that we\u2019ve had. Then think about the low numbers of those who have taken the Giving What We Can Pledge, joined the Facebook group, donated to a top charity, or applied to attend EA Global.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Think of all the VIPs whom we\u2019ve emailed, who have read our books, attended meetings with us, been to our events, or who are within our personal networks that aren\u2019t donating their fortune, or in most instances even one cent. Think of all of the friends within our networks, and think about how often we fail to grab their attention. Think of the ridiculous high level of conformity within the core of the movement, and our continued failure to attract those who would truly represent diversity.</p>\n<p>Every exposure that isn\u2019t a win is indeed a loss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I believe EA organizations and individuals should immediately &amp; drastically stop being so attention seeking, realize the danger of what we\u2019re doing, and focus much more on being experimental, measuring our results, and optimizing for conversion in every single form of outreach that we do. Only once we\u2019re measuring and unable to improve on our conversion rates should we go back to our awareness-building, attention-seeking strategies.</p></div></div>"},

{"date": "26th Mar 2015", "title": "Room for Other Things: How to adjust if EA seems overwhelming", "author": "Lukas_Gloor", "num_comments": "15 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><h2 id=\"Overwhelming_obligations\"><span>Overwhelming obligations</span></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onsIdBanynY\">drowning child argument</a>, which has persuaded many people to join the effective altruism movement, highlights one of EA\u2019s central concepts: Opportunity costs. The money spent on expensive clothes/shoes could instead be used to donate to cost-effective charities, where it can save the life of a person in Africa. Of course, the force of the argument does not stop there: If you have more money left, or if you could work for a few extra hours to earn more money, that too can be used to help additional people. Every decision we make has opportunity costs \u2013 this realization can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onsIdBanynY\">feel overwhelming</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Several critics consider the ideas behind effective altruism flawed or impractical because they appear to demand too much from people. In his widely cited essay </span><em>A Critique of Utilitarianism</em><span>, Bernard Williams argues that the idea of always trying to bring about the best outcome</span><sup>1</sup><span> places too high a burden on a person by taking away their choice in what they want to do in life:\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>It is to alienate him in a real sense from his actions and the source of his action in his own convictions. It is to make him into a channel between the input of everyone\u2019s projects, including his own, and an output of optimific decision; but this is to neglect the extent to which <em>his</em> actions and <em>his</em> decisions have to be seen as the actions and decisions which flow from the projects and attitudes with which he is most closely identified. It is thus, in the most literal sense, an attack on his integrity.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>The same of course also applies to women.</span></p>\n<p><span>When I first read Williams\u2019 critique a few years ago, I already considered myself an effective altruist and, as such, I found the arguments surprisingly unimpressive. I felt that <em>obviously</em>, if someone\u2019s goal is to make the world a better place, <em>this</em> is the person\u2019s decision and chosen life-project. But, as I\u2019m now more aware of than before, people have the tendency to <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/\">overestimate how similar other people are to themselves</a>. \u00a0I was already so immersed into EA-thinking that I forgot how I felt before. Williams\u2019 critique highlights an important point: If people are altruistically motivated but have other goals in life besides doing the most amount of good, or if they have other commitments that contribute to their self-identity and happiness, then they might \u2013 consciously or unconsciously \u2013 view effective altruism as something that threatens the things they consider valuable. This might manifest itself either in rationalizations against the concept of EA, or \u2013 if the person is more rational \u2013 it might lead to a genuine conflict of internal motivations, which may result in unhappiness. The situation becomes especially difficult for such a person if he/she is being pressured, either externally (by other people\u2019s expectations) or internally (e.g. by comparing oneself to a very high moral standard or to a person who gave up everything else for effective altruism). \u00a0Needless to say, this outcome is very unfortunate, both for the people themselves and for them not getting involved because of it.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<h2 id=\"A_healthier_framing\"><span>A healthier framing</span></h2>\n<p>Perhaps it cannot be avoided completely that some people are going have this reaction, at least to some extent, when they learn more about effective altruism. There is truth to the saying \u201cignorance is bliss\u201d: Some ideas, like the drowning child argument for instance, irreversibly change the way things are viewed by us. Nevertheless, I believe that the feeling of \u201coverwhelmingness\u201d discussed above is not called for.</p>\n<p><span>In this article I want to present a way to see or frame effective altruism that I consider both philosophically correct and useful from a motivational point of view. I prefer to think of EA as a choice, rather than some sort of external moral obligation. In reply to people who are concerned that effective altruism is overwhelming or overly demanding, I want to point out two important considerations:\u00a0</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>If you view EA as a possible goal to have, there is nothing contradictory about having other goals in addition.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span>Even if EA becomes your <em>only</em> goal, it does <em>not</em> mean that you should necessarily spend the majority of your time thinking about it, or change your life in drastic ways. (More on this below.)</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"What_are_goals_\"><span>What are goals?</span></h2>\n<p><span>Imagine you could shape yourself and the world any way you like, unconstrained by the limits of what is considered feasible and what not, what would you do? Which changes would you make? The result describes your ideal world, it describes everything that is at all important to you. However, it does not yet describe how important these things are in relation to other things you consider important. So imagine that you had the same super-powers, but this time they are limited: You cannot make every change you had in mind, you need to prioritize some changes over others. Which changes would be most important to you? The outcome of this thought experiment approximates your goals<sup>2</sup>.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"1__Having_other_goals_besides_EA\"><span>1) Having other goals besides EA</span></h3>\n<p><span><span>This part is trivial. Someone could give more weight to personal well-being or favored life-projects, while still spending some amount of time and money on effective altruism. There is nothing contradictory about having multiple goals \u2013 it just means that one has to make tradeoffs because resources are limited. Some people may think that it is somehow wrong or \u201cinelegant\u201d to have several goals, but as long as the person herself is fine with it, that\u2019s all that matters.\u00a0</span></span></p>\n<h3 id=\"2__EA_as_a_goal_does_not_necessarily_imply_sacrificing_all_other_commitments\"><span>2) EA as a goal does not necessarily imply sacrificing all other commitments</span></h3>\n<p><span>Giving up all your personal commitments is bad if this would make you psychologically unable to continue working productively on EA-projects. Compared to a <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/stress\">perfect utilitarian robot</a>, humans have many shortcomings. This is true for all humans, but the degrees vary from person to person. It makes just as little sense to compare yourself to a perfect utilitarian robot than to compare yourself to a person who is, for whatever reason, unreachably in a different starting position than you are.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>When people think of effective altruists, what sort of EA are they typically thinking of? Perhaps they first think of the guys who went into investment banking, working excessive hours and night-shifts, to donate 50% of their income; or the people who quit promising career paths in order to work full time for EA organizations; or the famous philosopher who </span><a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/\">churns out paper after paper</a><span>. Of course, the sort of people who do something like that are outliers, high-achievers that don\u2019t represent the typical (university-)population. It takes specific personality traits and skills to be motivated and able to do EA almost like an extreme sport. A more typical EA would be someone with a more \u201cnormal\u201d job who donates say 10% of their income, or everything above a limit that is enough to live comfortably while having some financial security in the future.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>The \u201chigh-achievers\u201d mentioned first are arguably the EAs who make the most difference individually, yet they only represent a small minority of EAs, even more so when EA becomes more and more mainstream. Are these people more motivated than other EAs, are they the only ones who \u201ctake EA seriously\u201d? This seems highly implausible. These people aren\u2019t more motivated to be EAs; rather, they are more motivated and/or more </span><em>suited</em><span> to do the </span><em>things that are most effective from an EA-standpoint</em><span>. This distinction is important, it means they don\u2019t necessarily care more, but their personalities and skills are such that they are placed in a better position to contribute effectively</span><sup>3</sup><span>.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>For the typical person, therefore, being an EA does not imply trying to do all the things those high-achiever EAs are doing. One could be tempted to view this as a watered-down version of EA, as \u201cEA light\u201d, but this would be getting it wrong: If you\u2019re doing the best you can, there\u2019s nothing watered down about your goals. Comparing yourself to the most skilled and hardworking EAs would be making the same kind of mistake, on a lower level, as comparing yourself to a perfect utilitarian robot. Even the most hardworking EAs need breaks sometimes, and in comparison with a perfect robot, they too fall short. Rationality is about making the best out of what you have. Holding yourself to impossible standards is silly and counterproductive; instead, the better approach is to find smaller but sustainable ways to contribute.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"Personalities_are_different\"><span>Personalities are different</span></h2>\n<p><span>People don\u2019t only differ in regard to skills, they also differ in regard to what they\u2019re interested in. In my case, becoming an effective altruist was easy for me. I discovered all this information out there, <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/\">LessWrong</a> and the now less active <a href=\"http://felicifia.org/\">Felicifia</a>, and I couldn\u2019t stop reading and having discussions with people, it wasn\u2019t like I had to force myself to do any of that. I think about EA-related topics most of the time because this is what I enjoy doing; if I found it strenuous (as some people will), I would be doing it less.</span></p>\n<p><span>Personality differences also reflect what sort of things people are (de)motivated by. Some people are attracted to weird (i.e. non-mainstream) ideas because they enjoy discussions. Others might dislike having to talk about or defend their positions constantly on the internet or in social settings, and if that's the case, a lot of EA-related activities become much harder.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Finally, personality differences also affect the way people prefer their life to go as a whole. Having balance in life is important for everyone, but some need a lot of it and others are more okay with a life that is optimized obsessively towards one single thing. People might have life-projects or strong commitments that would make them miserable if they had to be abandoned, <a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/cheerfully.html\">wanting children</a> for example, or a specific job one loves. These things are compatible with EA, because EA doesn\u2019t solely work if done as an extreme sport.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<h2 id=\"Some_advice\"><span>Some advice</span></h2>\n<p><span>It is important to take into account that people differ from each other in many respects, including previous commitments, \u00a0personality differences and differences in skills. Being rational about achieving your goals means, among other things, to understand what is within your reach and what isn\u2019t, and to not hold yourself responsible for being unable to do the impossible. I have the impression that some personality-types, especially people who are very altruistic and caring, sometimes suffer from holding themselves to too high a standard, from being unable to allow themselves to relax in spite of all the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/l30/on_caring/\">world\u2019s suffering on their shoulders</a>. Ben Kuhn\u2019s blogpost <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/stress\">To stressed-out altruists</a> contains a great insight that is worth quoting at length:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>I think the culprit of stress for many EAs is a lack of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmentalization_(psychology)\">compartmentalization</a>. Now, to really understand the ideas of effective altruism, you need not to compartmentalize too much\u2014for example, I have a roommate who buys the idea of altruism in the abstract, but doesn\u2019t do anything about it because he separates his brain\u2019s \u201cabstract morality\u201d module and its \u201cdecide what to do\u201d module. Because of things like this, compartmentalization has an often-deserved poor reputation for letting people evade cognitive dissonance without really coming to terms with their conflicting ideas. But compartmentalization isn\u2019t always maladaptive: if you do it too little, then whatever you care about completely consumes you to the point of non-functional misery.</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Effective altruism requires less compartmentalization than the average person has, so standard effective altruism discourse, which is calibrated against the average person, tries to break down compartmentalization. But you probably aren\u2019t the average person. If you\u2019re stressed out about effective altruism, <em>ignore the standard EA discourse and compartmentalize more</em>!\u00a0</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span><br>Most of the advice I\u2019d give to people struggling with EA is along the lines Ben talks about. I collected a list of things I use myself or would recommend for others for trying to learn to compartmentalize more, but of course, not everyone will find these applicable or equally helpful.\u00a0</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoiding daily dilemmas</strong><span>: If you find yourself having internal struggles every time you go to the grocery store, wondering whether you should buy expensive products or rather save the money for donations, it might make sense to set up clear heuristics for yourself, e.g. <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/keeping-choices-donation-neutral\">a yearly budget for charity</a>, that take care of recurring EA-related decisions. Choosing to donate a percentage of your income every month instead of \u201ctrying to see how much you can save\u201d each day allows you to not have to worry about saving the additional fifty cents (= deworming one more child!) every time you spend money on something. This way, you can free your mind from opportunity costs and focus on your personal needs, while still having the altruistic impact through your regular donations.<br></span><span>\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><strong>Putting emotions into perspective</strong><span>: I find that a basic understanding of evolutionary biology can be helpful in some situations. To a large extent (the rest is upbringing, experiences, randomness), your emotional reactions to things are the way they are because these reactions proved beneficial, in terms of gene-copying success, in the environment of your ancestors. Your <em>personal</em> goals are not tied to gene-copying success, and the modern environment is very different from the evolutionary one. Therefore, we should expect that emotions are not calibrated well to fulfill EA-related goals in the modern world. When you\u2019re feeling bad about a mistake you made or about not doing something, it does not necessarily mean that just because the feeling is really bad, what you <em>did/didn\u2019t do</em> is really bad as well. From a pragmatic perspective, feeling bad only makes sense as a learning mechanism if there\u2019s something you learn to do different the next time. Often people blame themselves for things that couldn\u2019t really be anticipated or changed. And even if a genuine mistake happened, after the lesson is learned it is important to try to take a <em>forward-looking perspective</em> and not fret about the past.\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span><em><br>Note</em>: This next example works very well for me personally, but I can imagine that the competitive aspect of \u201ctrying to score as many points as possible\u201d is bad for some people.<br>\u00a0</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Viewing EA as a game with varying levels of difficulty</strong>: When you look at life from a consequentialist point of view where opportunity costs are always looming in the background, the vast majority of things to do will be \u201cwrong\u201d in the sense that a perfect robot with your exact goals would do them differently. However, that\u2019s beside the point. Instead of looking at things as \u201cright vs. wrong\u201d, it fits better to think of things like a score system in video games, where you can gather points open-endedly. Foregoing a few points here and there will be fine as long as you keep track of the important decisions. Because life isn\u2019t fair, the level of difficulty of the video game will sometimes be \u201chard\u201d or even \u201cinsane\u201d, depending on the situation you\u2019re in. The robot on the other hand would be playing on \u201ceasy\u201d, because it would never encounter a lack of willpower, skills or thinking capacity. So don\u2019t worry about not being able to score very many points in the <em>absolute</em> sense, focus instead on how many points are reachable within the <em>difficulty-level that you\u2019re playing on</em>. <br>\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Separating conflicting motivations</strong>: If you find it hard to donate to organizations recommended by other EAs because you have a commitment to other charities, e.g. because you\u2019ve been a donor there for a long time, have visited the charity, or have found that their approach strongly resonates with you, then consider splitting your charitable budget in two parts, separating what you feel good about from what you consider has the best effect in terms of helping people. <a href=\"http://reg-charity.org/splitting-ii-feeling-good-about-donating/\">See this blogpost for a better explanation</a>. \u00a0An additional benefit is that, if this splitting is always an option, it prevents you from rationalizing that your previously favored charity is also the one that just happens to be most effective from an EA-point-of-view.\u00a0<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Talking to other EAs</strong>: If you\u2019re feeling bad about something or have a problem with some aspect of EA, it is likely that you\u2019re not the only person to whom this ever happened. Talking to others who may be in a good position to help out or give advice might be a good thing to try.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div><span><br></span></div>\n<address><span><sup>1</sup>Williams is talking about utilitarianism as a moral theory, not about effective altruism as an idea/movement. I realize that the two are distinct, e.g. one can be an EA without subscribing to utilitarianism. Nevertheless, large parts of Williams\u2019 critique, and especially the passage I quoted, apply well to EA.\u00a0</span><span><br></span><span><sup>2</sup>This question is of course a very difficult one, and what someone says after thinking about it for five minutes might be quite different from what someone would choose if she had heard all the ethical arguments in the world and thought about the matter for a very long time. If you care about making decisions for good/informed reasons, you might want to refrain from committing too much to specific answers and instead give weight to what a better informed version of yourself would say after longer reflection.\u00a0</span><span><br></span><span><sup>3</sup>Of course, the matter is not black-and-white. Caring/commitment does matter to a significant extent, i.e. there will be people who would be suited to do the extreme-EA thing but don\u2019t try enough.\u00a0</span><span><br></span><span><sup>4</sup>This also goes the other way (cf. \u201cscope insensitivity\u201d), but standard EA discourse talks a lot about this already.\u00a0</span></address>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},

In this post, Jess and I would like to explore some concrete ways in which we can all be more supportively sceptical.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Supportive scepticism requires a conscious effort</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>First, let\u2019s just highlight that for most of us, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to take criticism well - and that\u2019s natural. In his best-selling book \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People\u201d, Dale Carnegie goes so far as to advise that you should </span><span>never criticise anyone</span><span>. Criticism puts people on the defensive, he claims, so they\u2019ll rarely take it on board or learn from it - most likely, it will just lower their opinion of you. But most of us care about more than simply winning friends and influencing people - we want to try and figure out true answers to difficult questions.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>This suggests that we face a tough challenge if we want to both give critical feedback </span><span>and </span><span>remain motivated and caring towards each other. Although we\u2019re a community of people who value feedback and scepticism more than average, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that we\u2019re all human, and all likely to find critical feedback difficult. It\u2019s not just a matter of \u201cnot being mean\u201d - we\u2019re all going to need to make a conscious and deliberate effort to think about how the things we say might come across and affect others. This isn\u2019t just a problem we can brush off - it needs a lot of thought and effort if everyone is going to feel positive and supported.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Why are you giving feedback?</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Before giving someone a piece of feedback, you might want to think about a couple of questions: How are you feeling? Why are you giving this feedback, and why now? What is the best possible outcome? </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zenhabits.net/how-to-give-kind-criticism-and-avoid-being-critical/\"><span>This post</span></a><span> has a nice breakdown of the various different reasons we might give critical feedback:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>To help someone improve</span></li>\n<li><span>To see a change we would like</span></li>\n<li><span>To further the discussion</span></li>\n<li><span>To hurt someone</span></li>\n<li><span>To vent frustrations</span></li>\n<li><span>To boost our ego</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Hopefully the latter three don\u2019t occur too much in this community, but it\u2019s worth being aware that </span><span>sometimes </span><span>we might say something critical for bad reasons. So it may be helpful to check whether the reason you\u2019re commenting is one of the first three. If it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s probably best to refrain from saying anything.</span></p>\n<p><span>One way to check that you\u2019re not motivated by the latter reasons could be to consider how you\u2019re feeling as you comment - whether you feel angry or hurt, for example. As well as knowing that you\u2019re motivated by one of the first three reasons, it\u2019s often useful to know which, because it means you can focus on framing your criticism in the best way to achieve that goal.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Consider context</span></p>\n<p><span>Some situations are more appropriate for critical feedback than others. It\u2019s important to consider the content of the post, who the poster is, who they are addressing and where they are posting it, for example. </span></p>\n<p><span>Suppose someone posts a \u2018feel good\u2019 article about some way in which the world is getting better on their own facebook wall. They may well find it demotivating to have the article criticised, and the benefit of criticism in this situation is also probably quite minimal. This seems quite different to a case in which someone posts an idea they had in a group, asking people what they think of it - where critical feedback is much more appropriate.</span></p>\n<p><span>Timing can also be important: is the feedback about a project which the person is about to embark on, such that they can take your feedback into account? This seems an ideal time to provide feedback. On the other hand, giving someone feedback when they\u2019ve already completed a project and can\u2019t act on it risks just making them feel bad. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you\u2019re in an ongoing conversation, it might be useful to take note of how the person is responding to your comments. If they appear to be at all upset or defensive, it is likely to be better to step back from criticising them. Another piece of advice Carnegie has is taking care to avoid arguments. He points out that they often simply cement each side\u2019s views, and leave both parties feeling worse about each other. If a discussion seems to be taking that turn, it might be better simply to listen to the other side, and be grateful for their input, rather than continuing to put forward your view. If you find that too difficult, then the best move is probably to bow out entirely.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>The importance of positive feedback</span></p>\n<p><span>Whether you\u2019re giving feedback on an idea, a blog post or a whole project, the person you\u2019re talking to has likely put in effort and good work towards a valuable goal. Highlighting what you think they\u2019ve done well, what is valuable and what you admire in what they have done is likely to make them feel more motivated and more likely to take improvements you suggest on board. Likewise, people tend to feel motivated by acknowledgement of and gratitude for their hard work. We\u2019re so lucky to be part of a community where there are so many nice people working so hard to help others, which thankfully makes it easy to find positive things to say under most circumstances (though unfortunately it\u2019s also really easy to forget to look for them!).</span></p>\n<p><span>The popular management handbook \u2018The One Minute Manager\u2019 highlights the importance of using praise to encourage people, not just highlighting flaws in people\u2019s work. It contains a favourite sentiment of Michelle\u2019s: \u201cHere we put the accent on the positive. We catch people doing something right.\u201d It\u2019s so much easier to produce work and to share your thoughts when you feel they\u2019ll be appreciated and useful than if you expect only negative reactions to them.</span></p>\n<p><span>It might be particularly good to start and end your comment by telling the person what you like and admire about their post. This is particularly the case if you think the overall idea is a good one, though you think there are particular refinements that could be made. That way the person has an overall positive feeling toward your comment, which will hopefully leave them feeling enthused to carry out the specific suggestion you had. </span></p>\n<p><span>An underlying theme here is to cultivate an attitude of appreciation for others. Being grateful for the hard work people put in and respectful of the good work they are doing, whether that\u2019s in writing a blog post or carrying out a project, allows us to discuss with them ways in which they might be able to do even better without putting them on the defensive. Since it\u2019s </span><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier\"><span>well established that being grateful makes you happier</span></a><span>, this should benefit you, too!</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Highlighting areas of agreement</span></p>\n<p><span>Highlighting areas of agreement between you and the person you\u2019re addressing could also work well to improve a discussion. Adam Grant writes in Give and Take about the fact that \u2018rare commonalities\u2019 can bring people together: you naturally feel close to someone who has something in common with you, and the more so the more rare the thing you have in common is. </span></p>\n<p><span>Highlighting the assumptions you share with someone you\u2019re talking to could make you feel more like you\u2019re engaging in a collaborative search for truth rather than arguing. Similarly, if you\u2019re suggesting some improvement, frankly acknowledging that it\u2019s something you could also be doing better can help you connect, and also prevent you from coming across as patronising - thereby again cultivating a feeling of shared pursuit for knowledge.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Focusing on actions rather than people</span></p>\n<p><span>Feedback about character traits, or general tendencies that people have, can often feel like personal attacks. For that reason, it can be better when suggesting improvements to focus on particular actions, rather than on people\u2019s dispositions. For example, it might be more constructive to say \u2018claim X in this argument seems overconfident\u2019 rather than \u2018you seem overconfident\u2019. While the latter feels like a criticism of you as a person, the former is more like a suggestion that you rephrase a particular claim you made.</span></p>\n<p><span>One complication of this might be when criticising projects people feel extremely invested in. When we invest a lot of time and energy in a project, we often end up investing a large part of ourselves in them too. This means an attack on that project can end up feeling like an attack on your identity. It\u2019s worth bearing this in mind when we give feedback on a specific project we know someone is somewhat invested in. In this cases, we probably need to make even more effort to give positive encouragement as well as constructive feedback, and to be extra conscious of the language and tone we use.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Being specific and constructive</span></p>\n<p><span>The more specific and constructive a piece of advice is, the easier it is to act on, and the easier it is to feel positive about. In an ideal world, we would each have the time and motivation to look into every piece of feedback we got, and work out how we could act on it. In practice, frequently we don\u2019t. Making a comment actionable could ensure it gets acted on rather than forgotten about. </span></p>\n<p><span>Framing is also important - framing a comment as a way of making something even better than it already is, is likely to empower the person to want to improve their post. On the other hand, saying that a particular feature is bad runs the risk of creating an <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/21b/ugh_fields/\">ugh field</a></span><span> for that person around that area.</span></p>\n<p><span>It might also be helpful to think about what the other person\u2019s goals are, in order that you can frame your comments to align with those goals. That can help prevent you from talking past each other, and is extra helpful to them because it makes clear to them how they might be able to better achieve their goals. </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Hedging and warmth</span></p>\n<p><span>Using language that conveys warmth, support and humility may is easier said than done, but can make a </span><span>huge </span><span>difference. It\u2019s difficult to know how other people will take what you write. A few things that might help:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Using \u2018adding strength words\u2019 (like \u2018definitely\u2019, \u2018absolutely\u2019, \u2018extremely\u2019) when agreeing with someone or giving positive comments, but not when criticising. People often take criticism strongly to heart. For that reason, you might, for example, want to say something like \u2018this doesn\u2019t seem quite true\u2019 rather than \u2018this is totally untrue\u2019, since the former conveys your message while dealing less of an emotional punch.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Using exclamation marks. I was once with someone who texted two people to say he was going to be late to see them. One replied \u2018Fine\u2019 and the other \u2018Fine!\u2019. The sense we both got was that the former of these might be rather irritated by the lateness, but the latter wasn\u2019t - which even at the time seemed pretty ridiculous!</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Hedge: make clear that what you are saying is simply your opinion on the matter. Err on the side of saying \u2018it might be that...\u2019, \u2018my intuition is that...\u2019 rather than \u2018this is wrong\u2019. Online, simply stating something can seem aggressive when that was in no way the intent.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Being vulnerable: If a commenter takes a dominant tone, the person receiving the feedback is likely to feel put-down and defensive. They might react better to a tone which made clear that you have similar difficulties to theirs. For example, you might want to frame your suggestion as something that has worked for you, when you faced similar difficulties. Or, you might want to frame it as something the person may have already thought about: rather than saying \u2018you should have done x rather than y\u2019, you might ask \u2018I was wondering why you decided on x rather than y?\u2019.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Remember, it\u2019s a </span><span>person </span><span>you\u2019re talking to</span></p>\n<p><span>When commenting on blog posts or having conversations with online strangers, it seems rather easy to forget that there\u2019s a real person sat at a computer receiving your feedback. That person, like the rest of us, struggles to stay motivated and happy. Like the rest of us, they don\u2019t have the time or skill to do everything perfectly. Remembering that could help us to remain friendly, constructive and positive in our feedback, even when we are short on time and irritated by the imperfections in a post.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>We thought it might be helpful to provide what seems to us like a great example of supportive scepticism. The following is a quoted email: </span></p>\n<p><span>\u201cSome feedback attached. It sounds like things are going very well, apart from [feature eggplant]. Congratulations! </span><span>One thing I'd encourage you to do with these reports is, in the very first section, list something like:</span></p>\n<p><span>A. Top 3 achievements over last 6 months (this is for qualitative stuff beyond members increases) (I'm thinking just like 3 bullet points with a sentence or two)</span></p>\n<p><span>B. Biggest problem you have right now</span></p>\n<p><span>This would give us an opportunity to zero in on things you might need advice on. Anyway, glad it's going well! </span><span>Thanks for your hard work.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span>This acknowledges and is grateful for the work put in. The person makes clear that they are happy with the overall progress, and that they are enthusiastic about that (exclamation marks!). This made it really motivating to work on the changes suggested. Acknowledging that feature eggplant was less than ideal indicates that the overall view was genuine rather being fakely positive. The suggestion in the body of this email (as with the attached feedback) is very specific and actionable, making it easy to implement, and it explains the benefit of the suggestion. The whole inspires a spirit optimism and collaboration.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Where to go from here? </span></p>\n<p><span>It might be useful, going forward, for us to communicate to each other a bit about how we experience feedback. Someone might find it useful to hear that a you found a particular piece of feedback they gave you upsetting or stressful. Even better might be to convey to someone when a piece of feedback they gave you was really helpful to you. You might also like to follow up on feedback you\u2019ve given others, by asking them whether they found it helpful, and how it could have been more so. Hopefully we can work together to be a really supportive (as well as sceptical!) community.</span></p>\n<p><span>Further reading: </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>How to Win Friends and Influence People</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>The One Minute Manager</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Give and Take</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul></div></div>"},

{"date": "23rd Aug 2015", "title": "Why I Became an Effective Altruist", "author": "HaseebQ", "num_comments": "1 comment", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>EA Global, the largest ever public gathering of EAs, has left me reflecting on what it means to be an effective altruist.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, 400+ attendees and prominent EA activists, including Will MacAskill and Nick Bostrom (and Elon Musk!), converged on a Google Campus in Mountain View to discuss the state and direction of the EA movement. I ended up donning a volunteer shirt and helping out\u2014time-keeping for talks, directing and crowd-control, moving heavy objects (a weakness of many Effective Altruists), and scrambling to save the conference from various minor emergencies.</p>\n<p>It was an exhausting and important weekend, although it didn\u2019t feel important at the time.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, EA has come to guide the direction of my life. I\u2019m earning-to-give with my career (giving a third of all my earnings to high-impact charities), I\u2019m helping to lead <a href=\"/%E2%80%9Ddotimpact.im%E2%80%9D\">.impact</a>, a global EA volunteer group, and I\u2019m helping run Bay Area effective altruism <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/392649784261768/\">workathons.</a></p>\n<p>I\u2019m taking an active role in helping effective altruism to grow. And it\u2019s growing at a meteoric rate. Since the formalization of the movement in 2011, it\u2019s more than doubled every year. Effective altruism is going to be big, and it has the potential to seriously impact the world.</p>\n<p>I want to make sure that happens, and to make sure that impact is as big as it can be. For me, it\u2019s probably the highest-leverage way that I can change the world.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://airquipinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Separator_line-01-01.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In saying this though, I\u2019ve glossed over an important question. Why did I become an effective altruist to begin with?</p>\n<p>There are two ways to answer that.</p>\n<p>The first way is to say that all of the arguments are compelling. EA\u2019s critique of conventional altruism is rigorous and persuasive. If you, like me, are committed to moral consistency, it\u2019s hard not to be convinced. In a way, effective altruism begins by pulling softly on the threads of your beliefs, and by the time it\u2019s done, your moral imperatives look completely different.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s call that the ideological answer. It\u2019s the first reason why I\u2019m an EA, and maybe someday I\u2019ll tell the story how effective altruism changed my mind.</p>\n<p>But right now, I want to tell another story. I want to tell the story of why effective altruism changed not my mind, but my life. Why EA makes me do things that I wouldn\u2019t otherwise dream of doing\u2014like devoting my life to it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not because of the arguments or the ideologies. Those things are powerful, but arguments are paltry against all the history and conditioning behind a human life. It takes something more blunt than that to change someone\u2019s life. It takes something powerful and human.</p>\n<p>Really, it takes a punch to the stomach.</p>\n<p>The other night while walking home, I had such a punch.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://airquipinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Separator_line-01-01.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I was at the office exceptionally late.</p>\n<p>It was 1AM when I finally summoned the awareness that I ought to go home. I closed up my laptop, grabbed my messenger bag, put in my earphones and began down the stairwell. On the ground floor, the security guard, a weathered and prunish Asian man, was fast asleep in a leather chair. I gently opened and closed the building door behind me and stepped out onto Market Street.</p>\n<p>At 1AM on a Tuesday, SoMa is deserted. The crisp, young professionals are nowhere to be seen. Even the homeless, usually selling their wares or arguing on a street corner, are absent. There are only a few scuffed-up bundles here and there, dreaming against the walls of buildings.</p>\n<p>I turned the corner onto 5th street. It was silent, illuminated with street lights. Cars occasionally floated past. The night felt so barren, I could have been in any city in the world.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t explain it, but it was a scene of almost transcendent beauty. Do you know what I mean when I say that? There was nothing special about the sight of it. It\u2019s just that this was the world, undisturbed, and I was, for a moment, its only witness.</p>\n<p>How long has it been since I felt completely alone, I wondered? A long time. It\u2019s an important feeling\u2014perhaps the most important feeling of my entire life. Time and time again I return to it, or if I can\u2019t find it I go searching for it.</p>\n<p>Looking up at the lights, walking down 5th street, hands in my pockets, I was thinking: this is it. This is the world. The only one I\u2019ll ever get to experience. I never asked for it, I don\u2019t even deserve it, but here it is.</p>\n<p>I became aware of a song in my headphones. It was this one:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lMUMwxvmBWE/\">Youtube link</a></p>\n<p>And I then remember: damn, am I lucky.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m lucky to be born in a rich country.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m lucky to have headphones, to own this messenger bag. To have two strong legs. To not be in a bundle on the side of this street. To not have grown up fighting drugs, or malaria, or theocracy, or a war. I\u2019m lucky. I\u2019m so goddamn lucky, and right now I barely even feel it.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t earn my birth. I didn\u2019t earn my intelligence. I didn\u2019t earn my privilege, my health, my values, my messenger bag. It may as well have been divvied to me in an ancient, secret coup.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t stop walking. The song was building in my ears.</p>\n<p>Billions of humans in this world. And so many lives burdened and stunted by poverty, illness, trauma, war. Billions. Imagine if you could hear the sound of it all at once. That furious ocean of suffering, which is invisible to me because I\u2019m here. Because of how quiet this street is. Because this street has conspired to squelch the sound and magnitude of that ocean.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://airquipinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Separator_line-01-01.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>But you see, it\u2019s not the suffering that gets me. I can accept suffering. Somewhere, someone will always be suffering, and I know that.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just the injustice of it. It\u2019s that the injustice is so big, so absolute, it\u2019s almost suffocating. It\u2019s so much that you can\u2019t swallow right. All around the world, billions of lives\u2014billions, never given any relief, never given a way out of that ocean.</p>\n<p>So why me? Why do I get to walk down this street in silence? Why am I the one with a laptop and a messenger bag?</p>\n<p>You see, when I think about this, it makes me angry. It makes me fucking outraged. What would you do if you lived in such a world? In a world that conspires against itself, in a world that is arbitrary and unjust?</p>\n<p>Would it make you sick? Would it make you want to goddamn do something about it? To start a revolution? To throw up arms against this invisible oppressor?</p>\n<p>That\u2019s what it does to me.</p>\n<p>It makes me the kind of mad that I almost don\u2019t care what I do.

He may be responsible for articulating the idea, though. Re http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/02/20/moved-by-stats/ the probable source is a chapter titled \"The Aims of Education\" in Russell's 1926 \"Education and the Good Life\" (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The next stage in the development of a desirable form of sensitiveness is sympathy. There is a purely physical sympathy: a very young child will cry because a brother or sister is crying. This, I suppose, affords the basis for the further developments.</p>\n<p>The two enlargements that are needed are: first, to feel sympathy even when the sufferer is not an object of special affection; secondly, to feel it when the suffering is merely known to be occurring, not sensibly present. The second of these enlargements depends mainly upon intelligence. It may only go so far as sympathy with suffering which is portrayed vividly and touchingly, as in a good novel; it may, on the other hand, <em>go so far as to enable a man to be moved emotionally by statistics</em>. This capacity for abstract sympathy is as rare as it is important.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0I love this.

This aligns with my experience running the Technology and Innovation department at the</span><a href=\"http://arnoldfoundation.org/\"><span> </span><span>Laura and John Arnold Foundation</span></a><span> and with YCombinator\u2019s recently announced</span><a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/\"><span> </span><span>Requests for Startups</span></a><span>.

We will introduce projects that pass the evaluation to our network of individual and institutional funders and help find new funders if needed. We also provide strategic guidance, recruiting help and more. We are both cause-neutral and neutral on organization type (e.g. nonprofit, for-profit, benefit corporation etc.) Applications are rolling, but we devote more time to evaluations at set intervals throughout the year. The next evaluation sprint will be </span><span>May 1</span><span>, so interested projects should apply by then.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>To get a better sense of our evaluation process and of Effective Altruism Ventures itself, we completed an evaluation of ourselves using the EA Ventures evaluation framework. You can read the evaluation <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1qxem7YHEVweTNRSnBIMEJZT00&amp;authuser=0\">here</a>. The results of our evaluation indicate that there is insufficient evidence to recommend making donations directly to Effective Altruism Ventures at this time.

We will learn about your funding priorities and then introduce you to vetted projects that meet your priorities. If you don\u2019t like a project you are free to decline to fund it. We simply ask that you provide us with your reasons so we can improve our evaluation procedure.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong><br></strong></span></p>\n<p><span>We also help improve funder coordination for new projects.

told me there's \"a gold rush\" around getting new people involved with the effective altruist movement. \u00a0It's easy to see why this is so. \u00a0EA has been more frequently in the press in the past year. \u00a0And there are <em>four</em>\u00a0different books on effective altruism coming out, at least two of which will be marketed heavily by professionals. \u00a0<a href=\"/ea/gq/ea_advocates_announcement/\">EA Advocates</a> are helping spread EA content on Facebook and Twitter. \u00a0The <a href=\"http://eao.causevox.com/\">EA Outreach</a> team is also working full speed on other projects and the upcoming <a href=\"http://www.effectivealtruismsummit.com/\">EA Global conference</a> sounds like it will be pretty awesome.</p>\n<p>So, fingers crossed, the EA movement will be growing a lot in 2015. \u00a0But what should we do once those EAs show up?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"From_Intro_to_Impact\">From Intro to Impact</h2>\n<p><strong id=\"Stages_of_Effective_Altruism\">Stages of Effective Altruism</strong></p>\n<p>Having someone self-identify as an effective altruist is great, but ideally we want them to do something <em>significant and impactful, </em>such as donating 10%+ of one's income to effective charities, spending a similarly significant time doing direct work, considering a more ethical diet, and/or advocating to others.</p>\n<p>While it definitely has happened with people in this community, my guess is that people don't usually pick up a copy of Singer's book, read it, and then instantly decide to give 10%. \u00a0Instead, there seems to be some intervening stuff between getting introduced to EA and giving 10%.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"A_Funnel\">A Funnel</strong></p>\n<p>From this, we can then theorize an \"EA funnel\", similar to any other <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchase_funnel\">marketing / sales funnel</a>, where you maximize the impact of the EA movement by getting as many people involved with EA as possible and then getting as many of those people do give as much as they can. \u00a0People can drop off at any stage along the way, which is what we seek to minimize.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_Involvement_Problem\"><strong>The Involvement Problem</strong></h2>\n<p><strong id=\"Introduction_is_Well_Funded\">Introduction is Well Funded</strong></p>\n<p>Many people are working hard to introduce people to EA. \u00a0There's the four books I mentioned. \u00a0There's this forum you're at here, plus the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/\">active Facebook group</a>. \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com\">LessWrong</a> also has a lot of EA activity. \u00a0And there are many orgs -- such as The Life You Can Save, Giving What We Can, Charity Science, Raising for Effective Giving, and 80,000 Hours -- all working full-time to bring people into the movement. \u00a0There are <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/groups\">many meetups across the world</a> and people are <a href=\"/ea/ff/creating_a_local_effective_altruist_presence_in/\">working full speed to make more</a>. \u00a0Lastly, there's <a href=\"/ea/d1/list_of_introductory_ea_presentations/\">a lot of EA introductory talks</a> going on throughout the world, including\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en\">Peter Singer's TED talk</a>\u00a0which has received over 1.1M views.</p>\n<p>There certainly are many more things that can be done to introduce people to EA. \u00a0I've heard many interesting proposals I'd like to see go forward, such as <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/dg/tlycs_pamphleting_pilot_program/\">experiments with flyering</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Involvement_is_Relatively_Underfunded\">Involvement is Relatively Underfunded</strong></p>\n<p>What can people do once they join the movement, to further their involvement?<br><br>...They certainly can join things. \u00a0Facebook groups, this EA Forum, <a href=\"/ea/g3/announcing_the_effective_altruism_newsletter/\">mailing lists</a>. \u00a0They can begin to post and comment.</p>\n<p>...They can <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/profiles\">make an EA profile</a>.</p>\n<p>...They can start doing certain small actions, like <a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/fundraisers.html\">running a fundraiser</a> or doing <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/actions/shopping\">Shop for Charity</a>.</p>\n<p>...They could start earning and donating small amounts.</p>\n<p>...They could try to volunteer for an EA org.</p>\n<p>...They could join another action group, like <a href=\"/ea/gq/ea_advocates_announcement/\">EA Advocates</a> or <a href=\"http://www.dotimpact.im\">.impact</a>.</p>\n<p>...They could <a href=\"http://www.reducetarian.com/\">change their diet to be more animal-friendly</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But it seems hard for people to do more than that and many of these actions aren't even that well advertised anyway. \u00a0So what can we do?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"I_m_an_EA___Now_What_\"><strong>I'm an EA. \u00a0Now What?</strong></h2>\n<p>There is little between the introduction and quitting your job. \u00a0We should fix that. \u00a0So what do I propose?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Get_engaged_on_the__small_things_\">Get engaged on the \"small things\"</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"/ea/7k/what_small_things_can_an_ea_do/\">We've previously compiled a list of small things people can do</a>. \u00a0People's identities are reinforced by taking action, so doing small actions can lead to people doing larger actions in the future. \u00a0Moreover, these actions are quite valuable in their own right.</p>\n<p>We should update the list, think of what more we could add to it, think about how to <a href=\"http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~mmjhh/stuff/findmeatask/\">make it more digestible</a>, and then try to publish it widely (such as prominently on effectivealtruism.org).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Talk_1_on_1_with_an_EA\">Talk 1-on-1 with an EA</strong></p>\n<p>Several people are trying to talk to a lot of EAs, but they're busy with other things. \u00a0I've been lead to believe that there are more people who want conversations than there are people willing to talk, though I'm not sure if this is true. \u00a0Giving What We Can seems to have their member base covered with their latest hires, but no one is currently doing this for the wider EA community. \u00a0There seems to be little standardized network to connect a new EA to a relevant person to have a friendly chat about how to get involved, whether by email or by Skype.</p>\n<p>We could try to build an informal network, but I think it might be easiest just to hire (as in pay, potentially well, with money) someone or multiple people to dedicate time to being in contact with new EAs. \u00a0In particular, we'd be looking for people who are (1) knowledgable about the community, (2) relatable and friendly, (3) generally reliable, and (4) has the time and desire to commit to do this moderately long-term.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"More_work_on_building_and_sustaining_local_groups\">More work on building and sustaining local groups</strong></p>\n<p>Despite the world of the internet, meeting in person is still important. \u00a0There have been a lot more resources into building up local EA groups lately, but I'm less sure if there's sufficient resources going into maintaining existing groups -- checking in, making sure people have sufficient funding, trying to apply lessons learned elsewhere, etc.</p>\n<p>We also should have better norms for EA meetups. \u00a0I've heard of many people, myself included, neglecting EA meetups because they have more impactful things to do than what usually turns out to be glorified socializing. \u00a0But socializing is valuable for getting people involved and we should take this more seriously. \u00a0To make things a bit better, remember you don't have to meet monthly -- even quarterly is probably better than never. \u00a0Lastly, you could try to do more hands-on stuff in your meetups, like working through the aforementioned \"small stuff\" in groups, or doing other volunteering / outreach projects.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"An_Online_Hangout\">An Online Hangout</strong></p>\n<p>For those people not fortunate enough to be in a sizable local group, we can offer an online hangout. \u00a0Currently, <a href=\"http://www.dotimpact.im\">.impact</a> is serving this role by providing a meetup for anyone to join and learn about how they can get involved in the community. \u00a0And now we'll start running these biweekly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Think_about_scalable__more_meaningful__projects_to_offer_more_dedicated_volunteers\">Think about scalable, more meaningful, projects to offer more dedicated volunteers</strong></p>\n<p>Many people get involved in groups and do the small stuff, but want more. \u00a0Generally, though, orgs are disappointed by people -- despite having the best of intentions -- finding themselves unable to follow through. \u00a0This is totally understandable, but ends up giving a reputation of volunteers as unreliable and not worth the time.</p>\n<p>However, once we have enough small stuff for people to do, we can refer them to finish the small stuff and establish a track record. \u00a0If someone has done a good job, say, running a fundraiser, than chances are that they'll also do a reasonable job at some other task. \u00a0You can build from there.</p>\n<p>Right now, we don't really have that much readily available work to give to those people who are proven. \u00a0So we need more work to develop some projects that anyone can do, but are a bit bigger than the current ones. \u00a0Maybe current EA orgs could work to better open source tasks that are typically done by interns? \u00a0Maybe we could think of something else?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Connect_the_funnel_together\">Connect the funnel together</strong></p>\n<p>Lastly, we need to finish connecting introduction to further involvement. \u00a0People who are introduced through any of the various materials should be funneled to a place where they can learn about how to get involved, or they might end up dropping off. \u00a0And getting involved should include a clear progression from joining things, doing some small stuff, maybe talking 1-on-1, and progressing to more meaningful projects. \u00a0Hopefully, this eventually culminates with someone either earning to give or working full-time on EA stuff.</p>\n<p>Right now, many people aren't getting any answers about what to do next after seeing EA content. \u00a0And people who do get answers frequently get inconsistent ones. \u00a0It might be hard with the books that have already gone to print, but I think we could standardize this some more.</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "21st Dec 2015", "title": "Impossible EA emotions", "author": "ClaireZabel", "num_comments": "10 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>[This is a personal and emotional post about my feelings about EA. Probably not for everyone! Could cause sadness, scrupulosity concerns, and guilt.]</p>\n<p>I think it's true that 2x the suffering is 2x as bad, and it would be emotionally accurate for it to make me 2x as sad, i.e. if it did then my emotions would better reflect reality. But I worry that a lot of people get tangled up with the distinction between emotional accuracy and instrumental value of emotions. They're often correlated; it's useful to be more scared of dying in a car crash than dying by lion attack. And emotions can be motivating, so having emotions that reflect reality can cause greater effectiveness.</p>\n<p>But this gets tricky with EA.</p>\n<p>I believe the moral importance of suffering increases linearly as suffering increases, but there are non-linear marginal returns to having emotions that reflect that. Just as there are instrumentally rational techniques that require irrationality, there are instrumentally useful emotions that require emotional inaccuracy. I don't know what emotions are most instrumentally useful for improving the world, but they're probably not going to be the ones that correspond linearly to the reality of the amounts of suffering in the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I only know from the inside my own seemingly morally relevant experiences, my subjective feelings of joy and serenity and curiosity and sorrow and anger and apathy. In practice, I can only at my most emotionally expansive moments hold in my mind all the morally relevant experiences I think I have in my median hour. So I can maybe comprehend less than 1/140,000 of the morally important things I've personally felt*. I don't know if I'm an outlier in that regard, but I'm pretty certain\u00a0that I am<strong>\u00a0completely incapable</strong>\u00a0of emotionally understanding a fraction of the value of a life (even when I have the huge advantage of having felt the life from the inside). And that's not changing any time soon.</p>\n<p>Yet, it somehow seems to be true that billions or trillions of beings are having morally relevant experiences\u00a0<strong>right now</strong>, and had them in the past, and (many times) more could have morally relevant experiences in the future. My emotions are not well-equipped to deal with this; they can't really understand numbers bigger than a three or experiences longer than an hour (true story) (I may be unusually incompetent in this regard, but probably not by many orders of magnitude).</p>\n<p>The cost to save a human life might be a few thousand dollars. The value of each sentient life is incomprehensibly vast**. EA is a \"bargain\" \u00a0because so many lives are so drastically undervalued by others. And resources are scarce; even if some lives weren't undervalued relative to others, we still couldn't give everyone what their value alone would compel us to, if we had more.</p>\n<p>Having to triage is desperately sad. The fact that we can't help everyone is terrible and tragic; we should never stop fighting to be able to help everyone more. I worry about losing sight of this, and denying the emotional correctness of feeling an ocean of sorrow for the suffering around us. To feel it is impossible, and would be debilitating.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I can't emotionally comprehend all of what I'm doing and not doing, and wouldn't choose to if I could. That's why, for me, effective altruism is a leap of faith. I'm learning to live a life I can't emotionally fully understand, and I think that's okay. But I think it's good to remind myself, from time to time, what I'm missing by necessity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>*Assuming I have no morally relevant experiences while sleeping, which seems untrue.</p>\n<p>**With the exception of borderline-sentient or very short-lived beings that have lives with little (but nonzero!) moral value. \u00a0</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "26th Dec 2015", "title": "The big problem with how we do outreach", "author": "Lila", "num_comments": "17 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>A familiar pattern: EA organizations promote charities that help people in the developing world. A critic accuses EA of forcing people to be rationality robots. EA defends the use of rationality in altruistic decisions. But both sides miss the point: it demonstrates at best a lack of imagination and at worst coldheartedness to think that only a rationality robot would believe that African lives matter. I'm guilty of this too: it reveals my own prejudices when I think about helping people in the developing world (or livestock) as \u201cgiving from the head\u201d, rather than \u201cgiving from the heart\u201d. Promoting EA will require changing values, not just making people more rational.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"People_are_not_malfunctioning_utilitarian_robots\">People are not malfunctioning utilitarian robots</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Frequently, EA outreach starts from the implicit assumption that, deep down, people value all lives equally. In this narrative, the reason that people don't give to GiveWell-recommended charities is Kahneman-style irrationality. For example, supposedly people have biases such as scope neglect that prevent them from implementing their consequentialist values.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A typical EA example is the comparison between paying for a guide dog to help a blind person in the developed world versus curing many people of blindness in the developing world. To a utilitarian, choosing the former could only result from irrationality. But it's plausible that most people aren't utilitarians and don't care very much about people in the developing world. Even in surveys of philosophers, who would be expected to be more utilitarian than the general population, only a quarter are purely consequentialist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Rationality_alone_probably_won_t_lead_to_EA\">Rationality alone probably won't lead to EA</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some people might argue that non-utilitarians will become utilitarian if they become more rational. This argument relies implicitly on a belief in moral convergence, which is difficult to defend if one rejects moral realism, as many EAs do. These are very complex debates, which I'll discuss more in a followup post, but the idea that EAs can be created through rationality training alone should be viewed with skepticism. (This is another reason I'm skeptical of the ability of CFAR and similar organizations to have a positive effect outside of some very specific populations.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"A_comes_before_E\">A comes before E</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In short, people can't optimize for values that they don't have. For the majority of ordinary people, who don't share the egalitarian, utilitarian-ish values of EA, \u201cthe most good you can do\u201d is meaningless. This means that we need to start by spreading our values, before talking about implementation. Though rationality exercises won't be useful for this, countless social movements have proven that it is possible to change people's values, typically by combining various types of emotional appeals. Research into the causes of changes in values will be extremely important for the future of EA.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Expanding_the_circle_of_compassion\">Expanding the circle of compassion</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead of \u201cthe most good you can do\u201d, a better message for some audiences may be \u201cexpanding the circle of compassion\u201d. The idea that human culture has become more enlightened by being compassionate to those different from ourselves is catchy, emotionally appealing, and tends to approximate utilitarianism in practice.

So it might be important to have more people trying to spot opportunities and start effective charities with support from large funders or current EtGers. For instance, the Gates Foundation has <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation\">1200 employees</a> trying to help them deploy their money (and that\u2019s presumably not counting the people who help them start new organizations); applying a similar ratio to Good Ventures would suggest they should have on the order of 100 people helping them, whereas today they have ~10.</p>\n<p>Given that doing a normal job and making large donations is psychologically more attractive than trying to start nonprofits for a lot of people (including myself), this suggests that marginal EtGers (also potentially including myself?) might want to give more weight to trying to find opportunities to start new effective organizations, and leave the funding to people like Dustin Moskovitz.</p>\n<p>One counterpoint might be that \u201clarge funders\u201d are not actually that large; for instance, <a href=\"http://www.nptrust.org/philanthropic-resources/charitable-giving-statistics/\">72% of total giving is from individuals</a>, but I don\u2019t know if that ratio holds for global poverty or other causes EAs are interested in. And even if it does, it seems like you have to be a certain size of organization to raise grassroots funds effectively, and right now we don\u2019t have enough orgs of that size.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d love to get other people\u2019s thoughts on this.</p></div></div>"},

And, as detailed below, last year\u2019s EA survey </span><span><a href=\"/ea/da/a_taxonomy_of_ea_origin_stories/\">showed</a></span><span>\u00a0that a good number of people got involved through it. I\u2019d be interested in people\u2019s thoughts on all this. Below, I raise a few questions, make some scattered observations, and describe a pretty extreme hard and widely targeted sell I\u2019ve tried recently.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"Word_of_mouth_as_a_powerful_way_of_spreading_effective_altruism\"><a></a><span>Word of mouth as a powerful way of spreading effective altruism</span></h3>\n<p><span>Drawing on data from the EA survey, I discussed how people got into effective altruism in </span><span><a href=\"/ea/da/a_taxonomy_of_ea_origin_stories/\">A taxonomy of EA origin stories</a></span><span>. I distinguished between how people first heard about the term or the community, and what convinced them of EA ideas or got them into EA. 126 survey respondents reported first hearing about EA from friends, 237 said personal contact was important in getting them into it, and 196 said the same of friends or family. Note that since the question about the factors that were important in getting people into EA was multiple choice, there was some overlap between the last two categories. Also, as </span><span><a href=\"/ea/da/a_taxonomy_of_ea_origin_stories/\">discussed in the taxonomy post</a></span><span>, these figures are underestimates within the survey sample.</span></p>\n<p><span>These are sizeable numbers within a small movement. </span><span>To them I\u2019d add the following</span><span>:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>My anecdotal observation is that word of mouth\u2019s been a common factor among EAs I know.</span></li>\n<li><span><a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/conversation-with-michael-bitton-about-ea-marketing/\">Michael Bitton</a></span><span>\u00a0suggests that there\u2019s a core group of people inclined to quickly buy EA and that it\u2019s thus valuable to reach them through \u201cspray and pray\u201d marketing - spreading shallow exposure to our ideas to as many people as possible.</span></li>\n<li><span>There are also others who require in-person conversations, repeated exposure, or peer pressure (though these people\u2019s commitment to effective altruism may thus be fragile, particularly if the peer pressure doesn\u2019t persist). Friends are an unusually good way to get this. </span></li>\n<li><span>To the extent that peer pressure (or, to put it more positively, a social norm) is important, friends are an unusually strong and lasting source of this. </span></li>\n<li><span>EA\u2019s grown disproportionately in a few cities, and in those cities with which I\u2019m familiar this </span><span>seems</span><span>\u00a0to have been more through friendship circles than through people simply hearing talks.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"People_s_resistance_to_selling_EA\"><a></a><span>People\u2019s resistance to selling EA</span></h3>\n<p><span>Despite this, many people are reluctant to raise EA with friends, let alone to try selling it,</span><span>\u00a0let alone to</span><span>\u00a0apply moral pressure or give a hard sell of the sort I describe trying below. It\u2019s socially awkward, can feel implicitly boastful, carries some relationship cost, can make our friends uncomfortable, and conflicts with some common norms. And, given all this, we\u2019d expect to have a strong irrational bias against it too.</span></p>\n<p><span>I\u2019d argue that we should try to counteract this bias, because there\u2019s a possibility that doing so will lead to people taking EA actions (such as donating even small amounts to effective charities) which would outweigh these costs. The size of this possibility is very uncertain though; it would be valuable to pin down.</span></p>\n<p><span>It\u2019s interesting that people are willing to donate or pledge 10% of income but not raise EA with friends. Gently describing EA ideas to them seems less costly than donating 10% (although this would not obviously be the case with giving a hard EA sell to every single person you meet).</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"Possible_actions\"><a></a><span>Possible actions</span></h3>\n<p><span>Given the above, it could be valuable to find a way to make spreading EA messages to friends less awkward, and to coordinate and motivate people to do so. I\u2019ve created an </span><span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://impact.hackpad.com/Getting-people-to-sell-friends-on-some-EA-ideas-3hVuBam0yeK\">idea entry</a></span><span>\u00a0for this on .impact in case anyone\u2019d like to take it on. For instance, people could write sample messages or I-was-asked-to-forward-this-email campaigns. It would also be useful to gather evidence as to how well it works. To this end, I\u2019ve </span><span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LS9Jc1RP4vxJ5yrkhw_h3DX_XFyOXxBYANKp-BRUT0c/edit#gid=0\">created a spreadsheet</a></span><span>\u00a0in which anyone can record their attempts and results, and put in some of my own to start with. And it\u2019d be valuable to learn about the conclusions of other groups with more experience of evangelism through friends, such as peer-to-peer salespeople, religions and veg*ns.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"What_to_say__and_how_hard_a_sell_to_make\"><a></a><span>What to say, and how hard a sell to make</span></h3>\n<p><span>There are many different EA messages which you could choose to communicate, and different ways to present them. This raises a number of questions. Should you mention your own example? How much moral pressure should you apply? How hard a sell should you make? What are the risks of making people defensive?</span></p>\n<p><span>Participating in a fundraiser can be one of the best excuses to bring up the subject, as it\u2019s normal to approach people for donations or sponsorship. Charity Science runs several of these fundraisers for the EA community, including </span><span><a href=\"http://birthday.causevox.com/\">birthday</a></span><span>\u00a0and </span><span><a href=\"http://christmas.causevox.com/\">Christmas</a></span><span>\u00a0fundraisers and </span><span><a href=\"http://experiencepoverty.causevox.com/\">Experience Poverty</a></span><span>. That\u2019s one good reason to take part in them (consider joining Experience Poverty today!) There are also even less demanding opportunities to bring up EA ideas, like sharing some interesting content or a cost-free action that your friends can take, like </span><span><a href=\"http://effective-altruism.wikia.com/wiki/Shop_for_Charity\">directing 5% of their Amazon spending to top charities</a></span><span>. (It is</span><span>\u00a0less natural to make a pitch for donating to particular charity in these contexts though.)</span></p>\n<p><span>I\u2019ll conclude with an extreme example of spreading one EA message. I recently took advantage of my own Experience Poverty fundraiser to send the following message to every single non-EA I reasonably could. I used an expansive definition of \u2018reasonably\u2019, sending the message to everyone I knew except for rare cases where I\u2019d talk to them often and the social cost would be too high. This included many people I hadn\u2019t spoken to in years, every colleague at every past workplace, most people I\u2019ve ever studied with, every past neighbour I knew, people I\u2019d only spoken to once since I was five, etc. It was an uncomfortable thing to do! As you\u2019ll see, my message was quite the hard sell:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>Hi [who I was writing to],</span></p>\n<p><span>[Any personal things I wanted to write to them about anyway, such as checking what they were up to. I always enjoy catching up with people anyway.] For my part, we now have our core budget funded and after quite a search have found a </span><span><a href=\"https://www.google.ca/maps/@49.230341,-123.008752,3a,75y,316.14h,82.54t/data=%213m4%211e1%213m2%211sGFvIuA4DCv5IWOSnJ-1PIg%212e0\">new apartment</a></span><span>\u00a0to move into. I have one big thing coming up, which partly prompted me to write: I'm taking part in a large international fundraiser that I created and have led on (eating my own dog food - almost literally, as you'll see!)</span></p>\n<p><span>From Monday the 20th to Friday the 24th, I'll be living on less than \u00a31 (~CAD$2)'s worth of food a day, and getting sponsored to help those living in extreme poverty. We've signed up over a hundred people around the world to do something similar simultaneously, going for three days and spending \u00a31.50 (what the median person in the world spends on food). I picked \u00a31 because it's the international poverty line, and I really want my fundraiser to have the biggest positive impact possible. Both figures are already adjusted for how much they'd buy in poor vs. rich countries.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>I'm writing in case you want to sponsor me </span><span><a href=\"http://ukexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/tom-ash\">here</a></span></strong><span><strong>\u00a0- entirely up to you - but much more importantly to pass on what may be the most important fact you ever learn (seriously).</strong>\u00a0This is</span><span>\u00a0the reason why I picked the charity I did, and why it'd be a good one for you to donate to through this, or (what'd make it important) for the rest of your life. It's that some charities are hundreds or even thousands of times better than others, that an excellent charity evaluator called </span><span><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a></span><span>\u00a0picks these based on solid evidence, and that the one I've picked cures children of horrible parasitic worms for around 20p each. This means that if you donate \u00a3250 today you'd spare a whole village from this suffering, for at least a year - and if you donated nothing else, this would likely do more good that anything else in your entire life, even including all the deeply important things you do for those you know. (I personally find that a startling, profound and challenging thought.)</span></p>\n<p><span>If you donate \u00a325,000 to the best charities over your life you'd help a staggering number of people a great deal, doing more good than most ever do. Donate to other top charities and you'd save many lives; if you saved someone in person, you'd see it as something enormous, the greatest difference you ever made, and there's no less reason to do it when you can't see who you help. The numbers would scale as you donated ten times as much, and so on. And donating to charities which aren't quite as effective means that many more people suffer than otherwise would have. That's why these facts would be the most important ones you ever learn, if you act on them in any of these ways.</span></p>\n<p><span>The charity I picked is </span><span><a href=\"http://www.evidenceaction.org/dewormtheworld\">Deworm the World</a></span><span>. You can dig into it by reading the \u200b</span><span><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/deworming-charities.html\">short summary I wrote for Charity Science</a></span><span>, or \u200b</span><span><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative\">GiveWell's detailed review</a></span><span>. If you have any questions or concerns or thoughts about the charity or anything I've said, there's nothing I'd like more than to talk about them by email or Skype. Because it's so good you might want to consider making any sponsorship be your overall donation for the year, but in truth I don't care whether you donate through sponsoring me or not, and the important thing would be these facts influencing your future donations.</span></p>\n<p>I know this email is a strong sell, and heavy stuff; I'm essentially doing what evangelists do. I wouldn't normally do this and have never sent an email like this before for anything, but I hope you can tell that the reason I'm doing so this once is that I care passionately about it, and think that it would spare huge amounts of suffering if you acted on it, either now or throughout your life. I do promise never to bring it up again if you don't want to talk about it! I would love to hear what you're up to, and don't want fear of preaching to put you off ;)</p>\n<p><span>All the best,<br></span>Tom</p>\n</blockquote></div></div>"},

At the end, there is one parapgrah which I think concedes too much, however, regarding the triviality of the EA message. He writes:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>\u00a0Have I now defined \u2018effective altruism\u2019 to be so obvious that nobody could challenge it?</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>Here he seems to agree that <em>if</em> this were the case, then that would be a problem. However, he then goes on to argue that this isn't in fact the case - people do challenge the EA message, even if we understand it in his thin sense (as trying to do the most good you can, using analysis and evidence).<br></span></p>\n<p><span><span>I guess it's true that some people do challenge the EA message, but I don't agree with the notion that it would be a problem if that weren't the case.\u00a0</span></span><span>It would be if we were at an <em>academic seminar</em>,\u00a0trying to argue for a philosophical thesis. Philosophical theses shouldn't be trivial or obvious. We are not at an academic seminar, however - we are trying to\u00a0</span><em>change the world</em><span>. And in the real world, lots of altruistic work isn't remotely effective. This includes </span><em>lots of work done by people who would agree that it is obviously true that you should be effectively altruistic if asked</em><span>. It is one thing to intellectually agree that you should be effectively altruistic, if someone asks you that question. It is </span><em>quite</em><span> another thing to actually be effectively altruistic. In order to be so, I would guess you need to be constantly reminded of the necessity of thinking about evidence and cost-effectiveness.</span></p>\n<p><span>Here I think the EA movement has a very substantial role to play.\u00a0</span><span>My hypothesis is thus that the EA message is very fruitful <em>even</em> though it may be philosophically trivial. M</span><span>y anecdotal observations of EA members support this hypothesis - EAs seem to me to be highly effectively altruistic on average -\u00a0</span><span>but they're only anecdotal.\u00a0</span><span>Ultimately, this question needs to be settled through empirical research.</span></p>\n<p><span>As Robert notes, lots of criticism against the EA movement is not directed against the central EA message - what <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/13786913/Whats_Wrong_With_Effective_Altruism\">Iason Gabriel</a> in a critical piece calls \"the thin version\" - but rather against a number of \"associated ideas\", as Robert calls them (what Gabriel calls \"the thick version\").\u00a0These include criticisms of RCTs, particular conceptions of what's valuable, and so forth.\u00a0</span><span>I think this is at least partly due to confusion over the triviality objection.</span></p>\n<p><span>To see that, note that Gabriel motivates his choice to criticize the thick rather than the thin version of the EA movement as follows.<br></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>This paper focuses on the thick version of effective altruism. <em>Not everyone who identifies with the movement shares each individual belief, but, taken together, they capture much of what makes the approach interesting and unique. </em>They also explain many of the moral judgments that effective altruists make.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>My emphasis. Here Gabriel seems to imply that the thin version is trivial and not worth discussing. Well, it may be <em>philosophically </em>trivial, but again, the point isn't to be philosophically interesting, but to improve the world. And as a matter of fact, the EA movement is the first social movement which defines itself<em> </em>as a movement that is\u00a0</span><span>trying to improve the world in the most evidence-based and cost-effective way possible. Unlike other movements, the EA movement is thus not committed to any specific strategy, but rather to whatever strategy turns out to be most effective.\u00a0</span><span>Like I said above, my guess is that this means that the EA movement has an enormous potential for doing better than all other social movements, precisely because its members are constantly thinking about evidence and cost-effectiveness. Far from being uninteresting, the thin version of the EA movement is thus very interesting and unique indeed - it is one\u00a0</span><span>of the great innovations of the 21th century, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Doing-Good-Better-Effective-Difference/dp/1592409105\">as Pinker rightly has said</a>. Hence those who want to discuss the EA movement has every reason to focus on the thin version.</span></p>\n<p><span>As a side-note, it seems to me that the (thin) EA message has been </span><em>explicitly designed</em><span> to be trivial/obvious, at least for large swathes of the liberal, educated part of the population (whether this is indeed true someone who knows more about the EA history could perhaps tell me). The fact that the EA movement is such a \"broad tent\" - </span><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hx4/four_focus_areas_of_effective_altruism/\">that it includes organizations which work on poverty reduction, animal suffering, X-risk and meta causes</a><span> - makes it easy for these kinds of people to find a place within the EA movement. To my mind, this is not a weakness, but a strength.<br><br>[Slightly edited]</span></p></div></div>"},

An intervention that changes an individual\u2019s diet usually has only a temporary effect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on the data, ACE estimates that the average new veg*n lasts about 7 years, and they consider this an important factor affecting the cost-effectiveness of interventions to promote veg*nism. \u00a0But I'd submit that veg*n recidivism is actually even more important than ACE realizes.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I highly recommend <a href=\"/ea/ke/vegn_recidivism_seems_important_tractable_and/4a2\">this comment</a> to read along with the rest of this post.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3 id=\"Shifting_the_net_growth_rate_of_the_veg_n_movement\">Shifting the net growth rate of the veg*n movement</h3>\n<p>If a quantity is growing exponentially, the rate of growth is much more important in the long run than the quantity's current value. \u00a0A veg*n movement that constitutes 1% of the population and reliably doubles in size every 2 years will quickly surpass a veg*n movement that constitutes 10% of the population and reliably doubles in size every 20 years.</p>\n<p>Exponential growth seems like a good way to think about the growth of the veg*n movement because the growth rate of the veg*n movement is related in an important way to the movement's current size. \u00a0A larger movement means more word of mouth and more resources to plow back in to movement growth, creating a positive feedback loop. \u00a0And indeed, Google searches for the term \"<a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=vegan\">vegan</a>\" seem to be on a rough exponential trend, having doubled in the past 4-5 years.</p>\n<p>Exponential growth gets harder and harder to sustain the more you grow, and I think it'd be wishful thinking to say that the current exponential trend will continue forever. \u00a0The animal rights movement has been around for decades and the vast majority of the population is still omnivorous. \u00a0But the exponential model is still a powerful way to think about veg*n movement growth.</p>\n<p>Based on the exponential model, it makes sense to pay less attention to the current size of the veg*n movement and more attention to the net rate of growth in the veg*n movement. \u00a0And there are two factors affecting that rate of growth: the rate at which people come in, and the rate at which people leave.</p>\n<p>The rate at which people come in roughly corresponds to the quality of veg*n messaging. \u00a0Throwing your resources behind a message that converts at a higher rate means a higher rate of growth regardless of how many resources you have. \u00a0Fortunately for veg*ns, organizations like <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/organizations/the-humane-league-review/\">The Humane League</a>\u00a0systematically test different messaging strategies to see which work best. \u00a0(But note that more aggressive veg*n marketing strategies may backfire in the long run if they turn some people off of veg*nism and make it so exponential growth tops off sooner.)</p>\n<p>On the other hand, many fewer people seem to be working on the other factor that effects the net growth rate of the veg*n movement: the rate at which people leave. \u00a0And there are independent reasons to believe this number is more important. \u00a0Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sama/status/608327459252150274\">writes</a>\u00a0on Twitter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a much better metric than growth rate for early-stage startup success is how much users love the product. \u00a0but it's much harder to measure.</p>\n<p>they eventually converge, but it often takes years.</p>\n<p>in the mean time, lazy investors use growth rate as a proxy for product love, but often get tricked by growth hackers.</p>\n<p>the best investors dig in and figure out the answer to the first-order question.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To someone like Sam, the current veg*n movement might look like a startup that has a bunch of talented growth hackers but an uninspired product. \u00a0Most users abandon it. \u00a0In fact, it's even true that the <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animals-and-us/201109/why-are-there-so-few-vegetarians\">majority</a> of self-described \"vegetarians\" eat meat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3 id=\"Why_is_veg_n_recidivism_so_high__and_what_can_be_done_to_decrease_it_\">Why is veg*n recidivism so high, and what can be done to decrease it?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why do most vegetarians go back to eating meat? According to data collected by Hal Herzog the major reasons are, in order of frequency, declining health, hassles and social stigma, irresistible urges and shifts in moral thinking. Interestingly only 2/77 reported shifts in moral thinking made them go back to eating meat. This jives with what I\u2019ve read about former vegans. From the small sample of ex-vegans interviews I\u2019ve read, most seem to experience cravings or health problems and then rationalize their choices with changes in moral ideology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From <a href=\"http://sentientist.org/2013/06/15/oystersmusselspt2/\">here</a>. \u00a0Animal Charity Evaluators <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/foundational-research/social-movements-project/animal-activism-case-study/\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was also found that half of all veg*ns replaced meat with more vegetables, where legumes and grains would be a better choice nutritionally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it seems that the veg*n movement is not doing a very good job of helping veg*ns get all the nutrients they need in the absence of animal products.</p>\n<p>To delve in to this question further, it might be interesting to try to understand whether veg*n recidivism is higher in areas that have more veg*n food options (likely confounded with the number of veg*ns living in an area and providing social support).</p>\n<p>How might the veg*n movement work to reduce recidivism? \u00a0These <a href=\"http://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/\">blog</a> <a href=\"http://sentientist.org/2013/06/15/oystersmusselspt2/\">posts</a> on the ethics of eating oysters and mussels seems like a good step. \u00a0Educating veg*ns on how to get nutrients like creatine and choline that are mostly found in animal products could be valuable. \u00a0There might also be value in copying elements of traditional, and therefore proven, vegetarian and pescetarian diets.</p>\n<p>Why has the veg*n movement neglected recidivism thus far? \u00a0Note that many veg*ns insist that maintaining a veg*n diet doesn't require much ongoing effort. \u00a0I think the evidence shows pretty definitively that there's a large segment of the population that finds it difficult. \u00a0So perhaps veg*ns are self-selected to find veg*nism easy.</p>\n<p>Veg*n recidivists leave the veg*n movement, leading to them being underrepresented in the movement's decisionmaking. \u00a0The leadership of the veg*n movement is thus made up entirely of non-recidivists.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>As you might have guessed, veg*nism advocacy isn't my current guess for the best cause and I don't restrict my diet. \u00a0(I won't get in to details on this because I'd prefer to keep the discussion focused.) \u00a0But I know I appreciate people providing informed, thoughtful <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/01/show-outside-critics.html\">outside</a> <a href=\"/ea/df/the_outside_critics_of_effective_altruism/\">criticism</a> of the causes I support, and I guessed many veg*n Effective Altruists feel the same way, so that's what I tried to do for them. \u00a0Even though I don't think veg*n advocacy is the best cause, being veg*n seems admirable from my perspective and I thank veg*ns for their commitment to sentient life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},

The project ran longer than its initial funding period due to Effective Altruism Global events and one of the team member\u2019s need to take a job and work part time to guarantee future employment. In this write up, we\u2019ll be presenting a summary of our project, what we learned, mistakes we made, and a narrative of the project describing our work on policy comments.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Summary:</span></p>\n<p><span><span><br></span><span>Over the course of 15 weeks, Effective Altruism Policy Analytics produced policy comments on the United States Federal Register with the intent of improving regulatory action and collecting data on how to affect regulatory action. Since our last </span><a href=\"/ea/lj/effective_altruism_policy_analytics_update/\"><span>update</span></a><span>, we continued making changes in the same direction while also improving the formating of our comments. We also devoted some attention into regulatory reviews, which offer the potential to be more proactive in targeting bad policies for improvement while having a slightly lower probability of good feedback. Due to this project\u2019s speculative nature, predicting impact is difficult, </span><span>however on expectation the project was worth it.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Even assuming that most of our comments did nothing, the comment that we think is most likely to succeed involves roughly doubling the cost effectiveness of a $7.7 million program via changing building requirements and improving prioritization. As far as we could tell, our comment had no competition and was modeled after a successful change to international building codes that was accomplished via comment. If only this comment is successful, we\u2019d be generating over $2,500 in housing benefits per hour worked for some of the poorest Native Americans. If in the coming year, we receive feedback that we successfully influenced such a policy, the project is almost certainly likely to be worth the time invested, without the need to consider experimental value. Furthermore, many of the comments we worked on involved much larger possible impacts, though there was much more uncertainty about our chance of influence. </span><span><br></span><span> </span><span><br></span><span>Nevertheless, the primary value of this project is likely to be experimental value. With failed comments, agency responses will give us a window into what mistakes we made and other possible ways to influence policy. Successful comments may also help generate ideas for where effective altruists should focus their efforts to influence policy.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Overall, we think it is likely that this or a similar project will be worth funding in the future, though not in the same manner. We would benefit greatly from having people more experienced in economics, data science, and public policy working full-time on the project. Other than this, good changes are hard to predict and going forward should be informed by the policy feedback we receive over the coming year. </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>General Lessons Learned:</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>The comments that we think are most likely to cause changes were targeted at small programs with many obvious technical problems</span><span>. For example, a housing improvement program run by the Department of Interior, which used proxies for building code in areas with no building code, has requirements which are clearly worse than current building codes. We proposed a simpler and less stringent set of requirements that aligns better with current building codes, and would reduce building cost, allowing more people to obtain housing through the program. We believe agencies could avoid oversights such as this simply by consulting economists and engineers.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><span><span><br></span></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>The more expensive a policy is, the more attention it will attract, and the more research and opposition research will have already been done. </span><span>This caused our comments on larger regulations to be more uncertain, presenting information rather than always making a strong argument for change in a particular direction. In some cases, we just tried to simplify the way policies and equations were designed so that they would be easier to change and understand by regulators in the future. In a Department of Energy comment, for instance, we took ten lines of text describing an equation for program funding and re-wrote them in equation format. We highlighted that the original equation may not have been in-line with the regulation\u2019s intentions and that it may be possible to use a simpler equation that aligns more closely with the agency\u2019s actual goals. </span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><span><span><br></span></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>U.S. Government agencies vary a lot. </span><span>It can be hard to predict where there are opportunities for improvement</span><span> and to difficult understand the effects a policy may have. Specialization is often important in order to provide advice that exceeds the knowledge an agency already has.</span><span><br><br></span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>If you submit a factually incorrect comment, you are less likely to have influence than if you submit a factual one, even if an incorrect comment is written convincingly</span><span>. This is why we believe policy comments based on Fermi estimates can still have value, because they draw attention to the big picture. In the absence of the commenter having accurate info, regulators can fill in the blanks to make a better policy. </span><span><br><br></span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>In terms of time, it is very expensive to read through the federal register, especially without domain-specific background knowledge</span><span>. Much of our time working on the project was spent searching for policies to comment on. At first glance, it can be very difficult to detect if a proposed rule is worthy of investigation, and it can take a very long time to fully understand a policy. In some cases, we actually began drafting a policy comment before we realized that we had misunderstood the proposed rule. Several proposed rules had mistakes and ambiguities that prevented us from properly understanding their contents. A key lesson we learned from this was to review possible mistakes to understand how they were made. This could mean checking for typos by consulting other areas where the government agency had posted its proposed rule and making sure the posts are identical. Prevention could take the form of looking through older agency databases, looking for mechanisms that counter the an apparent policy problem , and reading the regulatory history surrounding an issue. </span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><span><span><br></span></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Economists like Richard Bruns are very good at working around hard problems quickly and finding decent proxy/estimated data when none is available for cost benefit analysis.</span><span> Many of the skills known by economists can be used to quickly estimate the positive and negative effects of a policy. This is contributing factor to why policy comments during the semester were faster than ones over the summer: we had full time access to Richard on the weekends that we did policy comments. Likewise, familiarity with data science and modeling can also be valuable for generating high quality comments rapidly as we noticed from our interactions with David Roodman.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><span><span><br></span></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Correspondence can be very attention-draining</span><span>. Communication time with outside groups and individuals who didn\u2019t respond pulled attention away from our direct work and many experts that did respond brought us no new useful information. Of the many people who wanted to be occasional volunteers at one point or another, only about 5 were consistently productive to work with. Until we made an email form, most requests for feedback were not worth the time we put into them. Countering some of these problems, also we developed a good habit of assigning small well defined tasks to occasional volunteers, and asked expert questions that were more likely to nudge them into giving us information we didn\u2019t already have. It is not easy to increase in scale, without focusing only on increasing scale and managing volunteers. Over time we concluded that without high-level guidance like we received from Richard, new versions of the project at other universities would have difficulty operating independently. Until that type of infrastructure can be established, we think it would be best to decrease prioritization for scaling the project up.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><span><span><br></span></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>It is very difficult to develop good performance metrics for producing policy comments</span><span>. Feedback is slow, and because of that, it is difficult to assess the probability of success. In addition, comments are reactive rather than proactive, so we were not able to propose new ideas unless they were relevant to content on the federal register. However, the benefits of influencing regulations in the federal register are potentially massive. A single comment could influence millions of dollars and save many Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years. While metrics like dollars and QALYs can be used to estimate how effective a given comment could be, they don\u2019t tell us much about our personal performance, as we don\u2019t yet know the likelihood that our suggestions will be adopted. We tried to use feedback from experts and people working in policy to improve our comments over time, but that isn\u2019t an objective metric. As we receive feedback from government agencies, we will gain insight about the success rate of our policy comments, and become more able to make concrete predictions about the expected value of given future comments. Direct feedback should be returning within 6 to 18 months.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><span><span><br></span></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Time management for this type of project is difficult</span><span>. Forming arguments and equations before completing citations, formatting comments, or following up on communication can greatly speed up the production of comments, but often leads to last minute surprises and large time consuming changes. We would first conduct a Fermi-Estimate, then replace estimated numbers with better data, to prevent the need to overhaul a comment from the ground up based on new information. However, rigorously verifying specific facts before trying to use them to fully form arguments is a risky time investment, since the facts that may initially seem the most relevant may not be relevant in the finished product. Better division of labor and communication norms improved our performance over time.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><span><span><br></span></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Small sample size paired with the complexity of regulations will make it difficult to make strong inferences of causation from just the outcomes of regulations</span><span>. We will be relying on responses of regulators to verify that we actually caused any impact. </span><span>Because regulators must respond by argument, there are several cases where we should be able to find out if the regulators made changes specifically due to our arguments. </span><span>In the first response we received, our group was addressed by name.</span><span><br><br></span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Significant Mistakes</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Comments were not optimally formatted at first (numbered, responding by question, etc). Formal correspondence in the federal government is fairly redundant, so including sections like executive summaries is counter-intuitive when our goal is to pitch an idea succinctly. It also greatly increases the workload per comment (resulting in less comments). Though our formatting improved over time, we still think future attempts at comments should pay more attention to format, and that a lot of attention should be given to the problem of how to quickly change format ahead of time. Rigorously checking every format change for errors results in a lot of wasted time, but failing to do so can lead to large problems.</span><span><br><br></span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>We had an equation for break-even analysis assuming that many people had a rational risk-informed preference to still ride motorcycles without a helmet or with an unsafe helmet. In our submission, a ratio was used which was not intended, that made new helmet regulation fare worse on break even analysis than our estimate would imply. This is likely inconsequential, because despite this mistake, proposed changes still passed break even analysis.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><span><span><br></span></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>We had over ten cancelled comments, which was a significant drain on time. Fortunately, many of these comments did not have a large amount of input before we made the decision to cancel them. Rather, we had marked them for consideration and performed introductory research before determining that the comment was not worthwhile and further time investment would be a waste.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><span><span><br></span></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>We had inconsistent values for the statistical value of life due to finding better sources over time, while also finding out that some of the currently used agency VSLs are not public. The method we settled with was to use the relevant government agency\u2019s most recent publicly published VSL and adjust based on time. </span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Responses</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span><span>Regulatory responses can take quite a lot of time. While we searched for comments to make on regulations with guaranteed feedback deadlines (usually final rules), most of the opportunities we found for this involved very specific issues which we were unable to gain the relevant domain knowledge on (railroad taxes, compliance cost for a specific set of businesses, etc.) within time constraints. Given that we were uncertain we could make correct comments on such issues, we opted for commenting on proposed rules and advanced notices of proposed rules more frequently. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Based on estimates from Richard and contacts in think tanks, we estimate it will take between 6 and 18 months for responses to come back. Accordingly, our only response received so far is from one of our experimental comments before EAPA started. </span><span><br><br></span></p>\n<p><span>EPA response to SNAP comment:</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eapolicy.wordpress.com/2015/07/09/protection-of-stratospheric-ozone-change-of-listing-status-for-certain-substitutes-under-the-significant-new-alternatives-policy-program-response/\"><span>https://eapolicy.wordpress.com/2015/07/09/protection-of-stratospheric-ozone-change-of-listing-status-for-certain-substitutes-under-the-significant-new-alternatives-policy-program-response/</span></a></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Work Credit</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Full-Time:</span><span><br></span><span>Matthew Gentzel</span><span><br></span><span>Emma Atlas</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Interns:</span><span><br></span><span>Lawrence Roth</span><span><br></span><span>Miles \u201cMilo\u201d King</span><span><br></span><span>Vincent Wu</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Significant Volunteers:</span></p>\n<p><span>Richard Bruns</span><span><br></span><span>Matthew Dahlhausen</span><span><br></span><span>Landry Horimbere</span><span><br></span><span>Rachael Kubicek</span></p>\n<p><span>Eileen Martz</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span><span>Donors:</span></p>\n<p><span>Jaan Tallinn</span></p>\n<p><span>Matt Wage</span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>Ben Kuhn</span></span> </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><br><span><span>If you'd like to learn more, comment below or read our in-depth project </span><span>narrative <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sLLh-flfi2cW28siEZyP6LwAtyP3Pk8kevcLMQkLL8E/edit\">here</a> which goes through what we worked on and commented on during our project.</span></span></span></p></div></div>"},

In short, the EAW is a 24/7 web-chat with optional video streaming where people work alongside each other in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique\">pomodoros</a> and chat during the breaks. Malcolm and I have been working on the project during the last months and you may have heard about it under its previous working title, the \u201cEA Study Hall\u201d.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vBzj1xC.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\"></p>\n<p>It is now online under <a href=\"https://complice.co/room/ea\">https://complice.co/room/ea</a> and has an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-ToHu5llC41ysh-fB6ocsdMzCv9TNC9Hf1hYuatKRh4/edit\">FAQ</a> for all open questions. Note that there might still be hiccups with the video broadcasts that are being fixed at the moment.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Why_use_the_EAW_\">Why use the EAW?</h1>\n<p><strong>Increase your productivity.</strong> Many people find it easier to work in a group, even if everyone is working on their own task. The pomodoros will help you get into a regular work/break rhythm, so the social norm is to work when everyone else does. This will also remind you to take regular breaks to recharge. The integrated pomodoro-counter makes it easy to track how much you\u2019ve worked on a task, and you\u2019re explicitly encouraged to celebrate your accomplishments during breaks. Setting up commitments within the hall is easy - e.g. announce your working goal for the next pomo or agree with another user to meet on the hall at a specified time. Even more ambitious users may also find it helpful to use a program to broadcast their screen for everyone to see, or to have other users hold them accountable if they don\u2019t meet a certain goal within a given time span (like 20 pomodoros over a weekend).</p>\n<p><strong>Make and keep connections.</strong> Many of us have full schedules and Skype calls to uphold friendships pose a real cost on time and flexibility and can be a pain to arrange. Keeping in touch via the EAW is easy - you\u2019re bound to bump into each every once in a while if you work at similar times. It doesn\u2019t cost you any additional time since you were having a break anyways, and you can make progress on your projects in the meantime. Win-win!</p>\n<p>Most people you will meet on the chat however will be new to you, so you\u2019re constantly getting to expand your circle of EA acquaintances, especially if you don\u2019t know many people within the movement yet. Some of these people will become your friends over time as well, and perhaps you\u2019ll even find some people close enough to visit.</p>\n<p>Based on experiences with the forerunner to the EAW, the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/m3z/less_wrong_study_hall_year_two/\">LessWrong Study Hall</a>, the social aspect that this space offers is easily overlooked and underestimated. Many people who decided to join the Study Hall mostly to increase productivity have stayed because of the warm and welcoming atmosphere and the friendships they formed during their stay there. We made this space because we believe the EA community will benefit greatly from having a similar place to, yes, work, but also socialize and create bonds.</p>\n<p><strong>Participate in the EA community.</strong> Learn which new or ongoing EA projects are out there, and get to know the people who are working on them. Or meet the people with whom you are working on a project. Or perhaps, join someone else with their project or find others to help you with yours. This is a space for coordination just as much as a space to get work done. That said, you can work on absolutely anything you\u2019d like while being on the EAW - it doesn\u2019t have to \u201cbe EA\u201d.</p>\n<p>Another thing is sharing resources: Don\u2019t hesitate to pick your fellow coworkers\u2019 brains during the breaks! Often you might find it useful to ask for feedback or advice where you\u2019re stuck, do <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging\">rubber ducking</a> or simply ask for some empathy for your struggles. Maybe they can point you to some of the many resources available to the EA community (e.g. for a presentation), connect you with someone you should meet or answer a question of yours.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How_to_get_help\">How to get help</h1>\n<p>If you have any questions that aren\u2019t covered in the FAQ, or something bothers you about the chat, you can talk to our moderators, who will hang out in the EAW to make your life better. Moderators have a star next to their name, so they're easy to spot. For all other questions, comments or feedback email Anne at anne (dot) wissemann (at) gmail (dot) com.</p>\n<p>In short: Meet aspiring EAs from all over the world, whenever you want, while getting work done.</p>\n<p>Sounds good? <a href=\"https://complice.co/room/ea\">Try it out!</a></p>\n<p>Malcolm &amp; Anne</p></div></div>"},

I <a href=\"http://vipulnaik.com/donation-history/\">myself donated</a> $125 to the Wikimedia Foundation around 2007/2008.</p>\n<p>Donating to Wikipedia makes <em>prima facie</em> sense: Wikipedia is an extremely valuable resource to humanity. How valuable? Take a look at the <a href=\"http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesPageViewsMonthlyCombined.htm\">numbers</a>: English Wikipedia alone gets 10 billion views a month, and all the other language Wikipedias get another 10 billion. That's a total of about a quarter of a <em>trillion</em> views a year. To put it another way, the mean world resident human views a little over 30 Wikipedia pages a year (and if you restrict to the population with Internet access, the number grows to over 100). If you very crudely estimate the average value of a pageview at somewhere between 0.1 and 4 cents, then the annual value delivered by Wikipedia is somewhere between $250 million and $10 billion. In comparison, the Wikimedia Foundation's <a href=\"http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/2014-2015_Annual_Plan_Questions_and_Answers\">annual plan for 2014-2015 calls</a> for $58.5 million in spending. So, looking at averages alone, we seem to be getting somewhere between a 4-fold and a 160-fold return on investment.</p>\n<p>But does donating to the Wikimedia Foundation <em>actually</em> make sense, once you think more closely about it? I think it could, for some particular sets of values that the donor may hold, and some particular set of beliefs about the world. However, I think that many of the arguments that people make for donating to the Wikimedia Foundation are flawed, based on a combination of factually mistaken beliefs and incorrect reasoning. In this post, I consider some of these arguments.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>We need to donate to the Wikimedia Foundation in order to make sure that Wikipedia continues running</strong>: I believe this is wrong, <em>even if you ignore the issue of marginal versus average donation</em>. Reasons: the foundation is sitting on large reserves, operations costs (including server costs and associated engineering costs) are less than 20% of the budget, and even if donations from individual donors (the main source the WMF relies on in its fundraising) reduced, there are a number of large foundations that would be willing to fill in the gap. Finally, in the highly unlikely event that the WMF did go under, backups of the content as well as publicly available copies of the underlying software could be used by others to set up a clone quickly (this is also compatible with the licensing agreement for the site's content and software, so legal issues are minimal). But in any case, if the WMF does go under, that's more likely to be due to lawsuits or malice on somebody's part rather than directly because of a lack of funds.</li>\n<li><strong>The Wikimedia Foundation is unusually well-run and efficient, so there is value in rewarding it for this by donating to it</strong>: The Wikimedia Foundation is reasonably well-run and efficient, but not extraordinarily so. Some people have made a big deal of alleged inefficiences in the WMF, but I think such apparent inefficiency is par for the course for a software organization of that size and scope. At the same time, there isn't good evidence of very high efficiency. Appropriate organizations in the broad reference class include the Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation, the WordPress Foundation and Automattic (the company that runs WordPress), and GitHub. Comparing the Wikimedia Foundation to Google or Facebook and then noting that it is much leaner and therefore more efficient is misguided.</li>\n<li><strong>The marginal and/or average donation contributes to improving content quality on Wikipedia</strong>: Donations don't go directly to content creators. Rather, they go into running the Foundation, whose main costs are staff salaries (staff includes software engineers as well as others) and grants to local chapters. One could argue that some of the activities sponsored spur greater editor participation, but the evidence for this isn't clear-cut. The software improvements that would allegedly improve editor participation have generally met with heavy backlash from the community and often been retracted. You might examine the data and come to the conclusion that donating does spur more contribution, but this isn't something that can be assumed offhand.</li>\n<li><strong>Wikipedia has helped me so much, it's important to pay back</strong>: The WMF has done a reasonable job of stewardship, but I believe that insofar as there inheres a strong moral obligation to pay back, this obligation is to content creators. Donating to the WMF does not reward past content creators.</li>\n<li><strong>If everybody donated $1, then ...</strong>: The \"if everybody donated $1\" argument is a dangerous slippery slope to get on. The argument is generally made from a Kantian moral imperative standpoint. But it proves too much, because if everybody gave $1 for any service that appeared to vaguely benefit them, that would lead to a lot of careless spending and a lot of overfunding for sectors of the economy whose value hadn't been proven out. This is also related to the <a href=\"http://www.commentarius.com/2011/03/09/concentrated-benefits-and-diffuse-costs/\">concentrated benefits, diffuse cost problem</a> that plagues politics.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"1_2__Where_I_m_coming_from__background_and_potential_conflict_of_interest_\">1.2. Where I'm coming from (background and potential conflict of interest)</h3>\n<p>As I noted above, I <a href=\"http://vipulnaik.com/donation-history/\">donated</a> about $125 to the WMF in 2007/2008. I haven't donated to the WMF since then. My reasons for donating back then were partly that the WMF had much smaller budgets and so the marginal impact of additional money (or what GiveWell and others have called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_for_more_funding\">room for more funding</a>) seemed more clearly positive. That said, with my current set of beliefs and goals, I probably wouldn't donate to the WMF even in a situation similar to what it was back then. Nonetheless, I don't have any deep regrets about the donations. They were a relatively small amount and I've made far bigger and more costly financial decisions of dubious and in some cases even negative value.</p>\n<p>I've written up my history of editing Wikipedia <a href=\"http://vipulnaik.com/wikipedia\">here</a>. TL;DR: I edited it a bit when I was an undergraduate (around 2005 and 2006) then reduced my editing involvement for a few years, then resumed around 2012. I've created <a href=\"http://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?tag=Pages%20created%20by%20Vipul%20Naik&amp;allmonths=allmonths\">over 200 Wikipedia articles that get a total of over 100,000 monthly pageviews</a>.</p>\n<p>Around 2008 or 2009, I had become quite interested in issues related to Wikipedia's management problems and the challenges facing the WMF. I had grown somewhat skeptical of the WMF and of Wikipedia, which was somewhat related to my reducing my editing involvement there. Some of that skepticism lives on in modified form, but my way of thinking about the issue has changed, and I don't endorse the connotations of some of my earlier writing about Wikipedia and the WMF, even if I don't have any object-level disagreements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1_3__What_I_m__not__trying_to_do\">1.3. What I'm (not) trying to do</h3>\n<p>This post holds plenty of potential to be construed as a smackdown of the WMF in the vein of those regularly published in venues such as Wikipediocracy, the Daily Dot, and the Register (all of which are linked here; seems like most of the external publications that cover WMF minutiae generally do so from a somewhat negative angle, and these are the three top ones). So before embarking on a more detailed justification of my claims, let me clarify a little bit more what I hope to accomplish:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don't intend to connote that there is anything particularly morally wrong or imprudent about making small donations to the WMF. I think that the arguments that people make in favor of it being virtuous, desirable, or necessary are misguided, but it's not a particularly evil use of money. People <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/06/limits-of-generosity/\">spend money in a variety of ways</a>, not many of which yield the sort of great returns we aspire to in our \"effective altruist\"-style resource allocation. If you think of donating to the WMF as a tip (which goes to the waiters and waitresses rather than the cooks!) it doesn't seem unreasonable. (I've made the analogy with a tip in an <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Wikimedia-Fundraising-Donations/Does-Wikipedia-collect-more-money-than-it-requires-to-run/answer/Vipul-Naik?share=1\">earlier Quora answer</a>).</li>\n<li>I don't intend to categorically rule out the possibility that donating to the WMF could be an effective use of resources. I don't think many of the arguments people commonly make for it are epistemically sound or factually well-informed, but there could be more sophisticated arguments and reasonable sets of goals and beliefs of the world where donating to the WMF is a great choice.</li>\n<li>Although it's a possibility I don't rule out, I don't claim categorically that the WMF is particularly inefficient as an organization, relative to other organizations in its reference class. Nor do I claim that it is failing to pluck any obvious low-hanging fruit. Rather, my claim is that the WMF so far hasn't produced a huge bang for the buck or shown signs of strong ability to deliver value on donations (beyond keeping the site running, which is no mean feat). I believe this is largely because the problems are inherently very hard, but I don't take a position on the extent to which intractability is a barrier.</li>\n<li>From a consequentialist perspective, I don't expect this post to significantly affect donations to the WMF. In the highly unlikely event that it reduces annual donations by something like $150,000 (more than a full-time software engineer's salary!) that still wouldn't dent the WMF's annual budget by more than 0.3%. But actually, even if my post influences donation decisions of $150,000, the WMF is likely to still meet its fundraising target by extending the fundraising period a little longer to make up for the forgone donations. So what could be the effect of this post? First, the set of people who might be persuaded by it is likely the set of people with the most sympathies to effective altruist ideas, so in a sense, substituting their donations away from the WMF would be more high-impact than substituting the donations of somebody who isn't interested in effective use of money in general. Second, I hope that my article helps spark a discussion, both about the WMF's activities and about some of the broader topics (philanthropy, nonprofit software organizations, obligations to give).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"1_4__A_bit_more_on_what_this_post_is_not_about\">1.4. A bit more on what this post is not about</h3>\n<p>The Wikimedia Foundation was in the news in December 2014 for allegedly misleading and alarmist language in its fundraising drive. You can see a mailing list discussion about these concerns <a href=\"http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/wiki/foundation/534599#534599\">here</a> and read some criticism from <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/12/01/penniless_and_desperate_wikipedia_sits_on_60m_cash/\">The Register</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/business/wikipedia-fundraiser-banner/\">The Daily Dot</a>, <a href=\"http://wikipediocracy.com/2014/12/11/the-wikipedia-fundraising-banner-sad-but-untrue/\">Wikipediocracy</a>, <a href=\"http://newslines.org/blog/stop-giving-wikipedia-money/\">NewsLines</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/wikipedia-millions-bank-beg/\">Make Use Of</a>.</p>\n<p>This post is not about that controversy, though I used some of the discussion engendered by the controversy to inform my views. In other words, I'm not focused on the question of whether the WMF's messaging is deceptive or whether it is morally culpable for the (in my view misguided) reasons people feel it is virtuous, desirable, or necessary to donate to the WMF. Interesting as that issue is, I'm more interested in articulating my reasons for believing that the arguments (as I believe many people formulate them) are flawed.</p>\n<p>Also, I am <em>not</em> claiming that the views here represent a consensus view of the effective altruist community, or even a dominant view within that community (for a broader spectrum of views from within the EA community, see <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/789939494395743/\">here</a>, and also wait for comments on the post you are currently reading). My views and perspective are informed by beliefs that are consonant with effective altruist values, but others who identify with these values may come to fairly different conclusions. Nor do I think you need to embrace general EA principles to derive value from, or even be convinced by, my arguments in this post.</p>\n<p>Further (unlike the case of <a href=\"http://qz.com/249649/the-cold-hard-truth-about-the-ice-bucket-challenge/\">William MacAskill's critique of the Ice Bucket Challenge</a>), the purpose of this post is not to say something like, \"instead of donating $100 to the WMF, donate it instead to a GiveWell-recommended charity.\" Of course, if somebody reads this post and decides to not make a donation to the WMF that they otherwise would, that leaves that extra money unallocated, and insofar as they have a specific total charity budget out of which that WMF donation was coming, they have the option of allocating the money to other charities. Otherwise, that money saved goes into their general pool of fungible money, which they can allocate to charity, saving, or consumption. But the <em>negative</em> decision to refrain from donating to the WMF does not imply any immediate <em>positive</em> decision to allocate the money thereby saved in a particular way. I do have thoughts on the latter, but this post is not the place to voice them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2__Evaluation_of_the_arguments\">2.

The ~$8 million operations costs include the server costs and relevant engineering costs. Note that the Internet hosting costs themselves are even lower: <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/e/e3/FINAL_13_14From_KPMG.pdf#page=5\">about $2.5 million projected for 2014</a> (the new plan doesn't seem to include a corresponding number).</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-arguments-against-donating-to-the-Wikimedia-Foundation/answer/Andreas-Kolbe\">Quora answer</a>, Andreas Kolbe quoted Jimmy Wales from back in 2005:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span><span><span><span><em>\u201cSo, we\u2019re doing around 1.4 billion page views monthly. So, it\u2019s really gotten to be a huge thing.

We could actually do without the employee \u2026 We actually hired Brion [Vibber] because he was working part-time for two years and full-time at Wikipedia so we actually hired him so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes.\u201d</em></span></span></span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>Wikipedia pageview counts have gone up by a factor of about 15X (about 20 billion monthly page requests) and pure Internet hosting costs have gone up by a factor of about 40X (from $60,000 annually to $2.5 million annually). This is roughly expected, because Wikipedia now aims for substantially greater reliability and has become a more critical resource.<br></span></p>\n<p>I think the total engineering operations costs are a more reliable proxy for the \"cost of maintaining the website\" than pure Internet hosting costs. They could overcount costs because some engineering operations aren't directly necessary to keep the site running. They could also undercount costs because, even if the goal were just to keep the site running, there would likely be other administrative overhead. I think that, extrapolating somewhat, an annual cost of about $12 million would be enough to keep the site running at its current performance, if that were the sole goal. And in the event that the WMF is able to raise no additional money, it could draw down its reserves and keep running the site <strong>for about four years</strong> (the Foundation has cash reserves of $28 million and other assets of $23 million).</p>\n<p>However, if individual donors cut back on donations and the WMF weren't able to meet its fundraising goals, it likely would simply fill in the funding gap from larger foundation and corporate donors. The reason the WMF relies on individual donors to the extent it does (about 85%) is to maintain independence from the agendas of these large donors. But this does mean that there are other lines of defense before the WMF would need to pare itself down considerably.</p>\n<p>Finally, <em>if </em>the Wikimedia Foundation had to close its doors, it wouldn't take long for another resource to create a replica of Wikipedia. The entire content of the encyclopedia is available as a public dump, updated every few weeks. There would be a painful transition but it wouldn't be a permanent loss. The content is also cached by Google and the Internet Archive. Needless to say, this is unlikely to happen, and the biggest risk factors associated with it happening are natural disasters and lawsuits rather than running out of money. But lawsuits themselves won't result in an immediate shutdown. If there were some sort of lawsuit or legal trouble, people would have ample time to prepare and respond to the site going down.</p>\n<p><strong>ETA</strong>: Andreas Kolbe has done a similar calculation as mine <a href=\"http://wikipediocracy.com/2014/09/21/wikipedia-keeping-it-free-just-pay-us-our-salaries/\">here</a>. I hadn't seen this calculation (though I had read his Quora answer linked above) before I did my own.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2_2__Is_the_Wikimedia_Foundation_unusually_well_run_and_efficient_\">2.2. Is the Wikimedia Foundation unusually well-run and efficient?</h3>\n<p>Co-founder Jimmy Wales hints at this efficiency in his letter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are the small non-profit that runs one of the top websites in the world. We only have about 200 staff but serve 500 million users, and have costs like any other top site: servers, power, programs, and people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people might interpret this as a claim that, compared with Google or Facebook or YouTube, Wikipedia is an extraordinarily efficient-to-run website. Where Google has over 50,000 employees and Facebook over 8,000, the WMF employs a mere 200. And while Google and Facebook measure their expenses in the billions, the WMF's $50 million is a bargain.</p>\n<p>However this is a misguided conclusion for a few reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The complexity of the task undertaken by Google and Facebook is substantially greater than that of the task undertaken by Wikipedia in terms of page serving. The majority of Wikipedia pages are loaded statically from a periodically updated cache, and require little computation or user-specific customization. Facebook, on the other hand, has to generate every pageview dynamically based on user-specific information. It's a much harder problem. Similarly, Google's search algorithm relies on indexing huge amounts of data, and its personalized search results rank them in real time using a fairly complicated strategy. YouTube probably comes closest to Wikipedia in terms of serving a predetermined page to users, but that's video streaming, which is fairly expensive in terms of bandwidth (that said, I believe the operating costs of YouTube are probably comparable to the WMF's annual budget, though much more than WMF's operations costs).</li>\n<li>On priors, we shouldn't <em>expect</em> that the Wikimedia Foundation should have figured out a technology or strategy to be so much more efficient than others. The median WMF employee may be somewhat better than the median Google or Facebook employee, but the top 200 employees at companies like Google or Facebook are likely to be a lot better than the 200 Wikipedia employees, if only because of the ability of substantially higher salaries to attract substantially better people.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here are some organizations that I believe fall in the broad reference class that the WMF does with respect to scope and influence on the Internet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automattic\">Automattic</a> is the company that runs <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress.com\">WordPress.com</a>, the platform where people can create their own WordPress blogs. It has also supported the creation and development of the open source and free WordPress software, though the software itself is managed by the WordPress Foundation. <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/automattic\">According to CrunchBase</a>, Automattic has raised a total of $310 million since its launch in 2005, of which $120 million was through secondary markets in 2013, and $160 million was a venture capital round in 2014. Automattic is a for-profit company that makes its money by offering WordPress hosting for big websites (such as <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a>) and its freemium WordPress.com offering. WordPress powers over 60% of websites, and WordPress.com has an Alexa rank of 33 when I last checked. It has 303 employees.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation\">Mozilla Foundation</a> is the steward for the open-source web browser Mozilla Firefox (and other related products) which powers <a href=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-200807-201502\">between 10% and 33% of web pageviews</a>. It had an annual revenue of $300 million when last reported, most of it coming from a deal to have Google as the default web search engine (the deal partner is now Yahoo!, but revenue for the deal has not yet been reported).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub\">GitHub</a> is widely used by open source projects to coordinate diverse contributions, as well as by companies, particularly small and middle-sized ones, to manage their codebases. The website had an Alexa rank of 95 when last checked. The company was largely self-financed to begin with but raised $100 million in 2012. It has 241 employees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We see that the WMF's revenue and expense numbers are within the same ballpark as those of these other organizations that are doing comparably complex stuff with reach that is roughly comparable, albeit in different ways.</p>\n<p>I don't have a clear assessment of the quality of WMF's software engineering. Considering that they've successfully kept the site functional and running, one can be reasonably confident that they're at least reasonably competent. But the value of many of the software innovation efforts is ambiguous at best. The basic MediaWiki software was written as far back as 2001 and its rate of change has been declining (it has been fairly stable since about 2013). This isn't necessarily a bad thing, since MediaWiki is a fairly good piece of software for something like Wikipedia. But insofar as it's great software, the credit goes to a team of people who built it long before the WMF started employing full-time software engineers.</p>\n<p>Two of the main products of recent years of software engineering effort, the <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/news/wikipedia-visualeditor-kww-patch/\">Visual Editor</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/08/18/class_war_wikipedias_workers_revolt_after_bourgeois_papershufflers_suspend_democracy/\">Media Viewer</a>, met with significant revolts from many vocal sections of the user community. Whether this was because the software was poor or because the community (or relevant sections thereof) were resistant to change is unclear, but either way, given that the goals of these products were to improve engagement and participation by the community, the failure of the products speaks to the Foundation's software engineering work often not furthering its stated goals. That said, there are some clear successes: the mobile version of Wikipedia and Wikipedia Zero are well-executed and generally liked.</p>\n<p>To take another example of more personal relevance: last year, I was interested in getting information on the total number of pageviews of Wikipedia pages I've created or edited. To its credit, the WMF publishes anonymized hourly logs that provide information on how many people viewed each page. In late 2007, Domas Mituzas created a tool, <a href=\"http://stats.grok.se\">stats.grok.se</a>, that processes these logs and allows people to get easy information on the number of pageviews of a particular page in a particular month. It's currently maintained by Wikipedia user Henrik. Note: This tool, which has been the main means for accessing analytics information for Wikipedia, wasn't created or maintained by the WMF, but by volunteers (the WMF has recently come up with its own tool, but I think it's still in beta, and Wikipedia's official statistics page still recommends stats.grok.se).</p>\n<p>In the beginning of 2014, I would manually query stats.grok.se for the monthly pageviews of all pages I created and enter the results into a spreadsheet to get an estimate of my impact. Finally, I decided to automate the process of retrieving the data, and I created the <a href=\"http://wikipediaviews.org\">Wikipedia Views website</a>, where you can now get the <a href=\"/&lt;a%20href=\">breakdown by page and month for pages I created</a>. When I made Wikipedia Views, I didn't have any experience managing a software project (though I had edited/tweaked pre-existing projects in the past), and I still managed to pull it off, over a few weeks of a few hours a week. Given the WMF's interest in attracting and maintaining contributors, and its having a full-fledged analytics team, I would have expected this sort of tool to have come from the WMF itself a while back. (Incidentally, MediaWiki itself, which is a far more complex project, was created by Magnus Manske over two weeks because he was interested in learning PHP and applying it to the wiki content creation problem).</p>\n<p>But what surprised me recently, when I was drafting my <a href=\"http://vipulnaik.com/blog/the-great-decline-in-wikipedia-pageviews-full-version/\">post on the great decline in Wikipedia pageviews</a> (something I noticed based on stats.grok.se data as viewed through my tool, and again something that I wasn't able to find any discussion of), was that the statistics on stats.grok.se (that are still listed as the best source for pageview statistics) <em>do not include mobile pageviews</em>. In fact, the WMF started publishing logs including mobile and Wikipedia Zero pageviews as recently as September 2014, but stats.grok.se is still using the old logs. This, despite stats.grok.se being cited and linked to as the canonical source of information on Wikipedia pageviews. And <em>bot pageviews still aren't excluded</em>, even though both the filtering out of bots and the inclusion of mobile pageviews have been on the agenda since <a href=\"http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/wiki/wikitech/334598\">as far back as February 2013</a>.</p>\n<p>There are many ways of interpreting these facts. Perhaps these analytics just aren't that important to the WMF or to their users, so they are not giving the analytics a lot of attention (my own interest in analytics is arguably quite atypical). Perhaps this takes a lot more resources than I think it does. Maybe a mere $50 million isn't enough, perhaps a $500 million annual budget is needed to get a quality analytics product. Whatever the case, I want to take this example to highlight that even with this large budget, many things that some might consider basic and relatively straightforward may end up not happening. So I think this is some evidence against the WMF being unusually efficient or good at getting things done (but it may not be evidence of incompetence <em>per se</em>). It also means that if your goal is to get some very specific project done, such as a new analytics tool, it's better to build it yourself or fund it directly, going through the WMF only if necessary.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2_3__Does_the_marginal_and_or_average_donation_contribute_unambiguously_to_improving_Wikipedia_quality_\">2.3. Does the marginal and/or average donation contribute unambiguously to improving Wikipedia quality?</h3>\n<p>Once we know that the servers that host Wikipedia can keep running for a small fraction of the annual budget of the WMF, the best argument in defense of the WMF lies in the value add of the Foundation to the underlying software and to the content created.</p>\n<p>I already noted above that the Visual Editor, the WMF's most high-profile software engineering effort to improve user participation, was rejected by the community after several months of effort. Apart from these software efforts, the Foundation has also tried a number of other techniques to increase user participation. These seem like valiant efforts, but they don't seem to have had a clear track record of success. For instance, efforts to improve article quality <a href=\"https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2014-March/070728.html\">appear to have stalled</a> because there is very little consensus on what article quality even means. There is much sporadic discussion about how to improve gender ratios in Wikipedia editing, but the end results are unclear.</p>\n<p>I don't think the difficulty with improving content quality, or expanding the range of editors and the quality of contributions, are evidence of any unique incompetence on the WMF's part. These are very hard problems, and it's possible that they can't be solved even if a lot more resources (including high-quality thought) were poured into them. Any steps taken to attract new people run the risk of alienating the current contributor core (as happened with the Visual Editor).</p>\n<p>So the pushback against the idea that donations to the WMF improve content quality isn't intended as a criticism of the WMF's competence, but rather of the idea that improving quality is a relatively easy task that the WMF is executing well.</p>\n<p>Outgoing WMF chief Sue Gardner has said <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/business/sue-gardner-log-rolling-corruption-wikimedia-chapters/\">something</a> <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/10/08/wikipedia_foundation_money_in_wrong_place/\">similar</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Too large a proportion of the movement's money is being spent by the chapters [whereas] the value in the Wikimedia projects is primarily created by individual editors: individuals create the value for readers, which results in those readers donating money to the movement. ... I am not sure that the additional value created by movement entities such as chapters justifies the financial cost,\" Gardner wrote.</p>\n<p>Worse is the risk for trading favours, taking advantage of positions and <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=trougher\">troughing</a> in general, she said. Gardner warns that the FDC [Funds Dissemination Committee] process is \"dominated by fund-seekers, does not as currently constructed offer sufficient protection against log-rolling, self-dealing, and other corrupt practices. I had hoped that this risk would be offset by the presence on the FDC of independent non-affiliated members\".</p>\n<p>Gardner questioned whether bankrolling local chapters was the way to go - and urged the community to look for alternatives.</p>\n<p>\"With such a high proportion of movement resources now funding [chapters' staff and offices], we need to ask if the benefits are turning out to be worth the cost. It's possible that a well-managed shift to some staff support can help a volunteer community stay energized and enthused, but the risks and costs of setting up bricks-and-mortar institutions also dramatically increase, alongside sometimes difficult dynamics between staff and community.\"</p>\n<p>She added: \"I believe we're spending a lot of money, more than is warranted by the results we've been seeing. I am concerned by the growth rates requested by the entities submitting funding requests to the FDC.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"2_4__Does_Wikipedia_helping_you_personally_make_it_morally_obligatory_or_desirable_to_donate_to_the_WMF_\">2.4. Does Wikipedia helping you personally make it morally obligatory or desirable to donate to the WMF?</h3>\n<p>First off, as noted earlier, the WMF <em>doesn't reward either past or future content creators</em>. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/wikipedia/9581813/Wikipedia-charity-faces-investigation-over-trustee-conflict-of-interest.html\">Past</a> <a href=\"http://wikipediocracy.com/2014/04/01/business-as-usual/\">experiments</a> with paid editing to improve quality <a href=\"http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Assessment_of_Belfer_Center_Wikipedian_in_Residence_program\">didn't go well</a>. It's not clear whether such efforts were inherently doomed or the execution was flawed. But whatever the case, it seems that payment of content creators is not part of the current agenda of the WMF.</p>\n<p>I think there could be a good case for donating to the WMF based on a sense of moral obligation if the money were going to those whose services most directly helped you (the reciprocity/returning favors perspective), and/or if it were clear that the WMF's use of funds, either at the margin or on average, were the most effective ways of furthering the goals of building the better encyclopedia that you benefited from (the effective altruist perspective). Neither of these seem true to me.</p>\n<p>As Bryan Caplan <a href=\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/04/jason_brennans.html\">noted in his blog post</a> reviewing Jason Brennan's book <em>The Ethics of Voting</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2. There are many extrapolitical ways to exercise civic virtue and contribute to the common good:<br>[M]any activities stereotypically considered private, such as being a conscientious employee, making art, running a for-profit business, or pursuing scientific discoveries, can also be exercises of civic virtue.\u00a0 For many people, in fact, these are better ways to exercise civic virtue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the same way, even if there is a generic obligation to \"pay back\" the world for the great resource called Wikipedia, that obligation can be fulfilled through many means other than donating to the WMF.</p>\n<p>This isn't to say that there is anything categorically <em>wrong</em> about donating to the WMF as a way of discharging the (perceived) obligation. I don't think it's the most effective or sensible apprach, but it's not obviously wrong.</p>\n<p><em>Aside: </em>Andreas Kolbe has <a href=\"http://wikipediocracy.com/2014/12/01/make-your-wikipedia-donations-count/\">proposed</a> that, rather than donating to the WMF, you seek out people to do paid editing and pay them if the quality of the work satisfies you, using the Wikipedia Review Board to find and communicate with the relevant editors. I don't have clear thoughts on this, but I do think that if your goal is to improve content quality or quantity on Wikipedia, editing it yourself -- or paying others to directly edit it through appropriate mechanisms (and not in violation of Wikipedia's guidelines) is probably a more cost-effective approach.</p>\n<p>The English Wikipedia has a little under 5 million articles, and all the language Wikipedias together have between 10 and 20 million articles, with a growth rate of about 10% per annum for the English Wikipedia and perhaps a little higher for other Wikipedias. So if we think of half the money going to the WMF as effectively being for the English Wikipedia, that's an annual spend of $25 million for about 500,000 new articles, so the cost per new article comes to about $50 (of course, this cost calculation is problematic because much of the new article creation is unrelated to much of the WMF's spending). At this kind of cost, creating new content yourself might well beat out making a donation.</p>\n<p>However, the \"engage in or fund content creation on Wikipedia directly\" argument is not essential to my main point here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2_5__Is_there_a_Kantian_imperative_to_donate_\">2.5. Is there a Kantian imperative to donate?</h3>\n<p>The Kantian moral imperative to donate is about seeking a good general rule that, if everybody (or sufficiently many people) followed, the world would be a better place. From this perspective, the rule \"don't donate to the WMF\" isn't a good rule, because if everybody followed that, the WMF would not have any money, and Wikipedia would not be able to survive. The Kantian imperative argument is not an argument about the practical consequences of your marginal decision to not donate, but about what general principles are best for the overall working of society.</p>\n<p>A slight variant of this is the argument: \"if every Internet user who has accessed Wikipedia gave $1 a year, then clearly everybody is donating far less than the value they get from the encyclopedia, but Wikipedia would have something like $500 million a year in revenue. So a $58 million annual budget is a bargain deal in comparison.\"</p>\n<p>It is true that $1 seems like a trivial sum of money for most donors relative to the value they appear to get from Wikipedia. But this type of argument proves too much. We can come up with lots of things that one could use the \"if everybody paid $1\" argument. But if everybody followed this argument literally, then people would rapidly spend out all their money in these $1 tips, and the providers of the relevant services would be flush with cash that they don't have good ways to allocate. I believe that this has already happened to some extent with the WMF, but even if you don't think so, it seems reasonably clear that it <em>would</em> happen at 10X the scale.</p>\n<p>Rather than adhering to the Kantian imperative, I think it's better to look at the issue from the perspective of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_for_more_funding\">room for more funding</a>: is the WMF in danger of failing to meet its core functions that have been known to deliver value, or of exploring directions that I think are particularly promising? The answer for me is a clear <em>no</em> at the current margin. But if the answer changed, either because funding went down a lot or because they started taking up much more promising projects, then I'd reconsider my decision in light of the new evidence (and blog my modified views, to set straight the public record).</p>\n<p>I think that there is some appeal of the Kantian imperative in that it avoids complicated game-theoretic coordination issues of the sort that GiveWell outlined in its December 2014 <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/12/02/donor-coordination-and-the-givers-dilemma/\">blog</a> <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/12/19/donor-coordination-and-the-givers-dilemma-part-ii/\">posts</a> on coordinating the contributions of several large donors. And if the WMF fell in the category of contenders for a top place to donate to (i.e., it were something I think there are strong reasons to give to, but we are just constrained on cash and there are somewhat better opportunities) then I think the sort of coordinated solution GiveWell tried to orchestrate would be worthwhile. I don't think that's the case with the WMF.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3__Conclusion\">3. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I will reiterate that this post is a reasoned criticism of donating to the WMF but not intended as a smackdown (I believe many of the problems being tackled by the WMF are intrinsically hard). Rather, I am using this post to explore what I perceive as factual and epistemic flaws in particular reasons to donate to the WMF. Given the publication venue (the Effective Altruism Forum) I believe some potential donors who read this might find the information contained here sufficient to tip them away from considering donating to the WMF, but it is likely that the majority of readers will not change their decision (some will continue to donate, some will continue to not donate).</p>\n<p>I hope this post is informative both regarding some of the facts surrounding the WMF's situation and regarding how somebody might use effective altruist principles in evaluating a particular giving opportunity. I'm interested in hearing other people's thoughts on both these counts.</p>\n<p>PS: I had posted about my plans to write this blog post on the Effective Altruists Forum in December 2014. You can see the post and the comments on it <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/789939494395743/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>PS2: Related to point 4 above, I have been experimenting with <a href=\"http://vipulnaik.com/sponsored-wikipedia-editing/\">sponsoring other people's Wikipedia contributions</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4__Addenda\">4. Addenda</h2>\n<h3 id=\"4_1__ADDED_December_2015__Remarks_in_light_of_renewed_interest_due_to_the_2015_fundraiser\">4.1. ADDED December 2015: Remarks in light of renewed interest due to the 2015 fundraiser</h3>\n<p>In its December 2015 fundraising drive, the Wikimedia Foundation hopes to raise $25 million. Skepticism of the Wikimedia Foundation's fundraising drive seems to be getting more mainstream now, with the <em>Washington Post</em> using a title that might have been seen on <em>The Register</em> a few years ago: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/12/02/wikipedia-has-a-ton-of-money-so-why-is-it-begging-you-to-donate-yours/\">Wikipedia has a ton of money. So why is it begging you to donate yours?</a> Despite the moderate increase in skepticism, I expect that the WMF will be able to successfully close its fundraising drive.</p>\n<p>However, the inherent challenge in raising more money given declining pageviews has been noted both in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2015-10-14/News_and_notes\">fundraising meta discussions</a> and in the <em>Washington Post</em> and other mainstream media coverage of the fundraising round. It is possible that this will place an effective ceiling on the amount of money that can be raised through fundraising drives in the coming years.</p>\n<p>As for the criticisms I made in my post of arguments for donating to the WMF, I believe that they mostly remain intact. The WMF has made some progress in various areas, but it's still quite unclear to me if this progress is impressive relative to the financial and manpower resources at their disposal. To take an example I've sort-of-been keeping up with, they've made a number of improvements in their analytics (they now have an API endpoint to get desktop/mobile and user/bot/spider views of a page by date) which is quite useful to me personally. But it's not clear that this is an impressive accomplishment relative to the amount of time it took and the amount of financial resources available to the Wikimedia Foundation. Also, the extent to which the various initiatives around analytics pay off in terms of better content and more pageviews remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>It's possible that I will revise my estimate of the WMF more favorably over the coming years, but as of now I still stand by what I wrote in my post.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4_2__ADDED_March_2016__Remarks_in_light_of_the_executive_shake_up_at_the_WMF\">4.2. ADDED March 2016: Remarks in light of the executive shake-up at the WMF</h3>\n<p>In February 2016, the Wikimedia Foundation revealed that it had applied for a grant from the Knight Foundation to build improved search functionality for the Wikimedia projects. This was consistent with WMF Executive Director Lila Tretikov's goal of making the organization <a href=\"http://time.com/wikipedia/\">focus on technology so as to facilitate greater engagement by editors and readers</a>. The ambitiousness of the project and the opportunity cost of going down that route attracted negative attention and comment from both WMF employees and influential community members. In addition, the lack of prior disclosure about the grant was not taken kindly by people who expected a higher degree of transparency form the WMF. WMF Executive Director Lila Tretikov resigned with her effective departure date the end of March 2016. Vice has two good articles on the subject (<a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/wikipedias-secret-google-competitor-search-engine-is-tearing-it-apart\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/wikimedia-foundation-executive-director-lila-tretikov-resigns\">here</a>) and Molly White provides a comprehensive <a href=\"http://mollywhite.net/wikimedia-timeline/\">timeline of events</a>.</p>\n<p>As an outsider, I don't have a strong enough view regarding how realistic the search functionality plans are. To some extent, I can see merit in both sides. I agree with Tretikov, and others, that the decline in traffic to Wikipedia is a significant issue for the future of Wikipedia and, by extension, the Wikimedia Foundation. In fact, I wrote a <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/lxc/the_great_decline_in_wikipedia_pageviews/\">blog post</a> about this decline a year ago. Given that at least part of this decline appears to be because people searching on Google are presented with knowledge cards on Google itself and therefore don't even click through to Wikipedia, providing a better in-site search experience could, <em>potentially</em>, address the traffic decline. It's not clear to me that this is necessarily a worse idea than others. I can also understand somewhat the need for secrecy in the initial stages of such a plan, given the potential both to alert competition about it and to alienate people within the community even before any details had been fleshed out.</p>\n<p>But that said, given that the Wikimedia Foundation's software engineering team had not, in recent years, done anything of comparable complexity to designing a full open search engine, and the fact that similar projects by other companies took huge amounts of resources, skepticism is in order.</p>\n<p>But regardless of which side you take in this debate, the attempt to build a search engine, and the subsequent executive fallout, suggest that it would in general be hard to do ambitious things with Wikipedia. You could argue that this is because a visionary executive director is hampered by a bureaucratic organization and community, or you could argue it is because the Executive Director lacked vision or the ability to cooperate with the community to move things forward. I think this on the whole supports my rebuttal on (2). Wikipediocracy, a website whose content I mostly don't endorse but that still provides an interesting genre of Wikipedia criticism, sums up the situation by saying that <a href=\"http://wikipediocracy.com/2016/02/26/unicorns-are-a-myth-lila-tretikov-resigns-as-wikimedia-foundation-executive-director/\">unicorns are a myth</a>.</p></div></div>"},

Rather than linking to your accounts on any EA sites I've just set up logins via Google accounts, which should provide most of the benefits in terms of spam prevention and easy account creation. I've added a few other extensions like semantic mediawiki which will allow structured data collected from infoboxes on organizations to generate neat tables with a little in-page query and some which allow you to embed hackpads, google docs, and a few other sites (</span><a href=\"http://wiki.effectivealtruismhub.com/w/index.php?title=User:Eric_Bruylant/sandbox\">examples</a><span>). There are still a handful of bits of improvement and polish on my to-do list (most notably caching which will speed page load times for non-logged in users considerably), but I've been encouraged to ship rather than waiting for the wishlist to be complete.\u00a0</span><span>There's probably a few things which need attention, please let me know if anything seems to be not working right.</span><span>\u00a0</span><span>\u00a0If you want any features in particular ping me and I'll let you know if it's plausible to add to MW.</span></p>\n<p><span>Thanks to Peter Hurford for the initial idea (I think?) and early work on wikia,\u00a0</span><span>Tom Ash and Giles Edkins for doing most of the recent work on content, Yanick Steinbeck for creating one of the version of the main page (integrating this with the current one is on the to-do list!) and useful discussions, Ozzie Gooen for setting me up with access and trying to get SSO working, and everyone else who's helped out or encouraged this to happen.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you're interested in joining in the </span><a href=\"http://wiki.effectivealtruismhub.com/w/index.php?title=EA_Wiki:Help_out\">to-do list</a><span> is a good place to look for open tasks.

{"date": "11th Jul 2015", "title": "The Bittersweetness of Replaceability ", "author": "Lila", "num_comments": "23 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><h2 id=\"Everybody_s_replaceable\">Everybody's replaceable</h2>\n<p>When I first became interested in effective altruist ideas, I was inspired by the power of one person to make a difference: \"the life you can save\", as Peter Singer puts it. I planned to save lives by becoming an infectious disease researcher. So the first time I read about <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/02/the-road-less-travelled-replaceability-and-neglected-causes/\">replaceability</a>\u00a0was a gut punch, when I realized that it would be futile for me to pursue a highly competitive biomedical research position, especially given that I was mediocre at wet lab research. In the best case, I would obtain a research position but would merely be replacing other applicants who were roughly as good as me. I became deeply depressed for a time, as I finished a degree that was no longer useful to me. After I graduated, I embarked on the frustrating, counterintuitive challenge of making a difference in a world in which <a href=\"http://www.houseoflists.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/replaceable.gif\">everybody's replaceable</a>.</p>\n<p>Replaceability evokes ambivalence: on the one hand, it makes one's efforts to improve the world feel Sisyphean. On the other hand, replaceability is based on a fairly positive perception of the world, in which lots of people are pursuing worthwhile goals fairly well. Lately I've become more optimistic about the world, which makes me more inclined to believe in replaceability. This makes certain EA options appear less promising, but an understanding of incentives can lead to the identification of areas in which one can make an irreplaceable difference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Donation_saturation\">Donation saturation</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/earning-to-give/\">Earning to give</a> avoids some of the problems of replaceability, but a major challenge is finding an effective charity that needs donations. As GiveWell <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/\">discusses</a>, there are few promising charitable causes that are underfunded. GiveWell often mentions lack of room for more funding when it fails to recommend a charity. It's somewhat easier to find funding gaps when considering more esoteric causes, such as existential risks, but as the GiveWell post mentions, even these areas receive considerable funding. A <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/k81/organisations_working_on_multiple_global/\">number of organizations</a>\u00a0work on global catastrophic risks. I've sometimes donated to EA organizations such as the Centre for Effective Altruism, only to feel a twinge of regret when their funding goals are quickly met or even exceeded. \u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"_Do_your_job_\">\"Do your job\"<br></h2>\n<p>Because of the limitations of earning to give, I've considered pursuing a career that would give me control over large amounts of money, particularly scientific funding. But lately I've been having a mental conversation like this:\u00a0</p>\n<p>me: If I take a job funding scientific research, I can do a lot of good. \u00a0I could potentially move tens of millions of dollars to effective research that helps people.\u00a0</p>\n<p>me: But isn't \"funding effective research that helps people\" already the goal of NSF and other major funders?\u00a0</p>\n<p>me: Well I would do it better, because I'm awesome.</p>\n<p>me: That's awfully cocky of you. What's something specific you'd change?</p>\n<p>me: I would fund more pandemic prevention, for example.\u00a0</p>\n<p>me: The U.S. government already spends $1 billion a year on biosecurity, as the GiveWell blog post mentioned. For comparison, the budget of NSF is less than $8 billion. The government is also <a href=\"https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/media/35695/cioce_current_vaccine_and_adjuvant_stockpiles.pdf\">stockpiling vaccines</a>\u00a0to prevent pandemics. There might be more work to be done, but you're running out of low-hanging fruit. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Many EA career ideas reduce to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTaZkf4dih8\">\"Do your job. Do the shit out of it.\"</a>\u00a0This is sound advice, but it's not as radical or inspiring as one might hope.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Is_everyone_else_an_idiot_\">Is everyone else an idiot?</h2>\n<p>If everyone else were completely incompetent, being good at one's job could allow one to make a large difference in the world. The narrative that \"everyone but me is an idiot\" is popular among open mic comedians, and there are hints of this feeling in much of the rationalist literature. Proponents of this viewpoint often point to problems in scientific research, particularly the lack of reproducibility. While I agree that there are issues to be addressed in the research process, there are some people who are beginning to address them, as the GiveWell blog post discussed. Additionally, <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/\">a single study</a> doesn't make or break a discipline. My experience in academia (I'm a bioinformatics PhD student) has been quite positive. Most published research in my field seems fairly good, and I think there are several factors that contribute:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Saturation: There are <a href=\"http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/27918/title/Is-America-competing-/\">1.47 million</a> researchers in the U.S., and they occupy almost every niche imaginable. I recently began a project in which I was trying to develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to filter binding events from background noise in Hi-C data. It was as arcane as it sounds, but as I was in the middle of it, another group published a paper doing exactly what I was trying to do, with an approach far better than mine. Even if you believe that most people aren't very clever, the sheer numbers mean that nearly every good idea is already taken.</li>\n<li>Feedback: While an individual researcher has incentive to make her own research look good, there's a pleasure to be had in destroying someone else's research. This can be witnessed at the weekly lab meetings I attend, in which adults are nearly brought to tears. Though the system is brutal, it results in thoughtful criticism that greatly improves the quality of research.\u00a0</li>\n<li>System 2 thinking: Daniel Kahneman describes system 2 thinking as <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kahneman-excerpt-thinking-fast-and-slow/\">slow, analytical thinking</a>. Many cognitive errors and biases result from the snap judgments of\u00a0system 1 thinking. I'd expect scientists to use system 2 thinking, because they think about problems over long periods of time and have a lot of domain-specific knowledge.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<div>These factors imply that being good at one's job won't have a large marginal benefit in many fields.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<h2 id=\"How_to_be_irreplaceable\">How to be irreplaceable</h2>\n<p>Finding irreplaceable EA work requires identifying areas of society that have systematic implementation problems. Focusing on cognitive biases may not be the best strategy, given that certain areas of society, such as scientific research and the stock market, seem to have avoided the worst of these biases, even without explicit training. Instead, the Austrian school of economics can offer insight here. Austrian economists define rationality as actions that people take to pursue goals. Goals are not explicit but are revealed through behavior. For example, a commonly cited example of irrationality is that if people are made organ donors by default, most people will be organ donors, but if organ donation is not the default, most people will not be organ donors. An Austrian economist would say that this behavior reflects the fact that most people don't want to research the pros and cons of the boxes they check on forms. Perhaps they value their time too much and have found that the default is usually decent enough. Even if they express different preferences in surveys, their \"true\" preferences are revealed by their behavior. Thus, most human behavior is rational. Even though this is a tautology, it's useful in understanding human behavior by focusing on incentives and preferences rather than nebulous attempts to pin down the platonic ideal of rationality.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The following figure is often used by libertarian economists to explain problems with economic incentives. The incentives of the state are represented by the red box. Though governments do some good, they also commit some of the largest and most blatant misappropriations of resources, including policies such as the drug war that are downright harmful. The charitable donations of the average person would be in the top right corner. This characterization seems accurate given that charitable donation is relatively stingy (<a href=\"http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/content.view/cpid/42#.VaGhGvlViko\">2% of GDP</a>) but largely ineffective: the most popular charitable causes are education (much of this is wealthy universities catering to wealthy students) and religion, which together account for <a href=\"http://www.aefonline.org/ranking-top-charitable-causes\">45% of charitable giving</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.slobodaiprosperitet.tv/sites/default/files/images/4%20ways%20to%20spend%20money.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>However, in the strictest sense, scientific research and high-impact charities like the Gates Foundation would fall into the red box as well, and I've been arguing that there's more efficiency in these areas than one might expect. Thus, I'd characterize the matrix as a spectrum, rather than being binary. My lab is not exactly spending our money and we're not exactly spending it on ourselves. But we spend a lot of time thinking about how to spend the limited money we receive, and we have deep domain-specific knowledge of what we're spending it on. Because we associate the money and our research so much with ourselves, we're much closer to the top left corner than the U.S. president is when he creates a budget.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, saturation, feedback, and system 2 thinking promote high-quality scientific research. How do charities and governments compare on these dimensions? The market for charities is fairly saturated, and there are several organizations that do high-quality research, engage in system 2 thinking, and provide feedback. On the other hand, charitable donations from ordinary people are not subject to system 2 thinking and appropriate feedback. An analogous situation exists in government policy: a saturated field of think tanks and wonks engages in high-quality analytical thinking and provides feedback on policy proposals. However, the world of governments is not saturated, and individual governments face little competition. The feedback that governments receive is often perverse: citizens want lower taxes and higher government spending. System 2 thinking is notoriously lacking in public policy.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusions\">Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Replaceability is a problem in almost every aspect of EA (though some EAs may see it as a weight off their shoulders). I feel slightly more favorably toward earning to give than I did previously, but I'm concerned about the lack of good giving opportunities. Direct EA work seems to be a good option, but there should be much more advocacy than research. EA organizations are probably reinventing the wheel through their research. Nitpickers will point out that advocacy itself is saturated and replaceable - this is probably true to an extent. Instead of advocating for specific policies, it may be better to focus on creating systems with favorable values and incentives. Compared to academic discussion of fallacies, an understanding of incentives can provide more insight into why systems fail. EA could benefit from the perspectives of libertarian economists.\u00a0</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "14th Apr 2015", "title": "How We Run Discussions at Stanford EA", "author": "MichaelDickens", "num_comments": "3 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Stanford EA holds weekly discussion-focused meetings, with an average turnout of around 15 people. These are based around sheets with a list of questions and relevant background; you can see examples of previous ones <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7BGumocZjekfjJXYVBaWWF6S0ZPN1czSVF5QVNnWUhORFpIWkw2Nms4RU9TOXhuU0FYa00&amp;authuser=0\">here</a>. (Thanks to Kelsey Piper for writing these!) At one point we planned to consistently provide a page of background on the other side of the sheet; we've partially stopped doing so, as the background didn't seem to really guide the conversation.<br><br>First we have a few minutes to write down our answers to the questions on the sheet. We then go around the circle doing introductions, as specified at the top of the sheet. Then, for each question, we go around the circle and give our response to it.<br><br>Most of the interesting discussion happens as prompted by things people say when providing their answers. It\u2019s pretty loose: people ask you about your answer, and you respond to them, and the discussion kind of goes where it will. When it\u2019s gone on a long enough tangent, Kelsey moves the conversation along by asking the next person to give their answer to the question. This is a great way of ensuring that the conversation can stay roughly on track and everyone gets a chance to speak. Often meetups have a problem where new people don\u2019t know what to say; this goes some of the way to solving that.<br><br>These questionnaires also make the discussion more accessible to people who know less about effective altruism, because often it\u2019s easy to grasp the complex natures of questions like \u201chow much do you value IQ increases vs saving more lives\u201d. The Stanford EA meetup, like all meetups, occasionally veers pretty hard into jargon and confusing advanced territory, but Kelsey is able to somewhat restrain that by moving the conversation to the next person or next question. The background info on the sheets, when present, also helps.<br><br>It\u2019s rare that we actually make it all the way through the questions. Usually we discuss some aspects of a later question when talking about an earlier one, or we do a quick straw poll about a later one and don\u2019t discuss it further. Generally, the topics which lead to the most digressions are the more abstract or philosophical ones; when we talked about population ethics, we spent an hour and a half discussing the first question.<br><br>The meetup lasts for an hour and a half, after which most of us get dinner together. Dinner discussions tend to still be about EA topics, but instead about anything people who want to talk about. They also tend to be where we discuss/plan ideas for non-discussion meetings; the larger number of people allows the leaders to get better feedback on which future events should be run.<br><br>(Thanks to Buck Shlegeris for writing the first draft of this post; thanks to Kelsey for running the meetups and writing the discussion sheets; thanks to Alex Richard for revisions.)</p></div></div>"},

It has the direct effect of preventing people from getting malaria, but it might have much larger <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">flow-through effects</a>. Here are some effects AMF might have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increasing human population size by preventing deaths</li>\n<li>Decreasing human population size by accelerating the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition\">demographic transition</a></li>\n<li>Increasing people\u2019s economic welfare, which causes them to eat more animals</li>\n<li>Increasing people\u2019s economic welfare, which causes them to <a href=\"http://foundational-research.org/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/\">reduce wild animal populations</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Increasing population might be good simply because there are more people alive with lives worth living. Accelerating the demographic transition (i.e. reducing population) might be good because it might make a country more stable, increasing <a href=\"http://foundational-research.org/a-lower-bound-on-the-importance-of-promoting-cooperation/\">international cooperation</a>. This could be a very good thing. On the other hand, making a country more stable means there are more major players on the global stage, which could make cooperation harder <sup><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Some of these long-term effects will probably matter more than AMF\u2019s immediate impact. We could say the same thing about GiveWell\u2019s other top charities, although the long-term effects won\u2019t be exactly the same.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Everything_Is_Uncertain\">Everything Is Uncertain</h2>\n<p>There\u2019s pretty clear evidence that GiveWell top charities do a lot of direct good\u2013but their flow-through effects are probably even bigger. If a charity like AMF has good direct effects but harmful flow-through effects, it\u2019s probably harmful on balance. That means we can\u2019t say with high confidence that AMF is net positive.</p>\n<p>Among effects that are <em>easy to document</em>, yes, AMF is net positive (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCoYq7kzcH0\">maybe</a>). Maybe we could just ignore large long-term effects since we can\u2019t really measure them, but I\u2019m uncomfortable with that. If flow-through effects matter so much, is it really fair to assume that they cancel out in expectation?<sup><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup> We don\u2019t know whether AMF has very good or very bad long-term effects. I tend to think the arguments are a little stronger for AMF having good effects, but I\u2019m wary of optimism bias, especially for such speculative questions where biases can easily overwhelm logical reasoning; and I think a lot of people are too quick to trust speculative arguments about long-term effects.</p>\n<p>So where does this leave us? Well, a lot of people use GiveWell top charities as a \u201cfallback\u201d position: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced by the evidence in favor of any intervention with potentially bigger effects, so I\u2019m going to support AMF.\u201d But if AMF might have negative effects, it makes AMF look a lot weaker. Sure, you can argue that AMF has positive flow-through effects, but that\u2019s a pretty speculative claim, so you\u2019re not standing on any better ground than people who follow the fairly weak evidence that <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/interventions/online-ads/\">online ads</a> can cost-effectively convince people to eat less meat, or people who support <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/ai-risk/FutureOfLifeRFP\">research on AI safety</a>.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t like speculative arguments. I much prefer dealing with questions where we have concrete evidence and understand the answer. In a lot of cases I prefer a well-established intervention over a speculative intervention with <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/\">supposedly higher expected value</a>. But it doesn\u2019t look like we can escape speculative reasoning. For anything we do, there\u2019s a good chance that unpredictable long-term effects have a bigger impact than any direct effects we can measure. Recently I contemplated the value of starting a <a href=\"http://mdickens.me/2015/09/12/charities_i_would_like_to_see/\">happy rat farm</a> as a way of doing good without having flow-through effects; but even a rat farm still requires buying a lot of food, which has a substantial effect on the environment that probably matters more than the rats\u2019 direct happiness.</p>\n<p>Nothing is certain. Everything is speculative. I have no idea what to do to make the world better. As always, more research is required.</p>\n<p><em>Edited to clarify</em>: I\u2019m not trying to say that AMF is too speculative, and therefore we should give up and do nothing. I strongly encourage more people to donate to AMF. This is more meant as a response to the common claim that existential risk or factory farming interventions are too speculative, so we should support global poverty instead. In fact, everything is speculative, so trying to follow robust evidence only doesn\u2019t get us that far. We have to make decisions in the face of high uncertainty.</p>\n<p><em>Some discussion <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/979015585488132/\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"Notes\">Notes</h2>\n<div><ol>\n<li>\n<p>I recently heard Brian Tomasik make this last argument, and I had never heard it before.

rather than here]</p>\n<p>Effective altruism is really extraordinarily good at telling people where to give money, and pretty okay at telling people how to create less animal suffering. \u00a0Guidance on how to do anything else is\u00a0substantially more opaque, because EA\u00a0discourages a lot of traditional\u00a0<a title=\"How effective is volunteering at a suicide hotline?\" href=\"http://acesounderglass.com/2015/03/25/how-effective-is-volunteering-at-a-suicide-hotline/\">volunteering</a>\u00a0(at least as a way of improving the world. \u00a0As a hobby most people are still okay with it). \u00a0That\u2019s a shame, because there\u2019s a lot\u00a0left to do.</p>\n<p>There are an enormous number of unsolved problems in effective altruism, and philanthropy in general. \u00a0And there\u2019s actually a fair amount of support for you, if you want to research or attempt a solution. \u00a0But the support is not\u00a0very discoverable. \u00a0\u00a0A lot of the information spreads via social osmosis, and if you\u2019re more than two degrees out from one of the big EA hubs\u00a0the\u00a0process is slow and leaky. \u00a0 It\u2019s not always obvious from the outside how approachable many people and organizations in EA are, or what\u00a0problems are waiting for solutions. \u00a0But once you have that knowledge, it\u2019s really hard to remember what it was like when you didn\u2019t, which makes it hard to figure out what to do about the problem.</p>\n<p>This is my attempt to address that. \u00a0Below I have listed info\u00a0on the major EA organizations, with emphasis on what problems they are interested in, how to learn more about them, and what kind of contact they encourage. \u00a0 I would be surprised if this was enough to enable someone to go from 0-to-implementation on its own, but my hope is that it will provide some scaffolding\u00a0that speeds up the process of learning the rest of it.</p>\n<p>Institutions: did I get something about you wrong? \u00a0Miss you entirely? \u00a0Please let me know and I will update, I want this to be as accurate as possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"General_Misc\">General/Misc</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a

the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.openphilanthropy.org/\">Open Philanthropy Project</a>. \u00a0OPP investigates not just specific interventions, but causes, trying to determine which areas have the crucial combination of importance, tractability, and neglected-ness. \u00a0The good news is that you can read about it in detail on their blog. \u00a0The bad news is that you can read about a great many\u00a0things in a great deal of detail on their blog, so\u00a0if you\u2019re looking for a particular thing it can be hard to find. \u00a0To that end, here\u2019s are some links to get you started

Charity Evaluators, Life You Can Save, Global Philanthropy Project, EA Ventures\u2026 \u00a0all of which I have included in this document. \u00a0 Their\u00a0<a href=\"https://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/homepage/special-projects/\">current plan</a>\u00a0appears to be that, plus some outreach.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.eaventures.org/\">EA Ventures</a>\u00a0is a new agency dedicated to matching up\u00a0people with EA projects, people with money, and people with relevant skills. \u00a0EAV\u2019s official areas of interest are the effective altruism trinity: global poverty, animal suffering, and existential risk, and a lot of the things on the list\u00a0of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/fr/a_call_for_ideas_ea_ventures/\">community suggestions</a>\u00a0they solicited fall into those\u00a0three +\u00a0meta-EA work. \u00a0 And yet, the list is almost 10 pages long. \u00a0Even within those spaces (one of which the rest of the world already looks at pretty closely), there are a lot of ideas. \u00a0I\u2019m also heartened to see \u201cmental welfare\u201d as a category, even if it\u2019s empty. \u00a0Next time, EA Ventures, next time.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://dotimpact.im/\">.impact</a>\u00a0started as a\u00a0combination of \u201cThe Volunteer Committee to Spread and Improve Effective Altruism\u201d and a platform to publicize and network for\u00a0your own projects. \u00a0They have just started branching out into more direct support with a\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/ie/introducing_the_impact_fund_paying_for_small/\">slush fund</a>\u00a0to help people put the finishing touches on their projects. \u00a0If you want to get involved formally, there are biweekly meetings with agendas and people leaving with action items and everything, but you\u2019re also encouraged to just make a wiki page for your project and announce it on the facebook group. \u00a0Presumably because you\u2019re looking for comments or help, but it doesn\u2019t obligate you to the formal group in any way. \u00a0They maintain a list of\u00a0<a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/Projects-aRiPtncmuKS\">projects</a>, most of which are related to movement building, but Tom Ash has confirmed that\u2019s a matter of circumstance, not policy. \u00a0This seems like a great resource if you want to invest some time, but not necessarily a whole job\u2019s worth of time, in EA, or if you\u2019re looking for learning projects. \u00a0One thing I particularly appreciate\u00a0about the list is that it calls out useful practice problems; if you\u2019re going to learn Ruby, it might as well be while patching up

of a narrow cause focus still having a lot of room for innovation. \u00a0 Their\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/planned-research/\">planned research</a>\u00a0includes the very specific (\u201chow does viewing a video on animals affect diet in the medium term\u201d), but also the very broad (\u201cHow to measure animal welfare?\u201d, which is itself at least\u00a0five different questions, and \u201cHow have other social justice movements done things? \u00a0How would those things work for us?\u201d, which is several graduate thesises all on its own).

My primary motivation for writing this analysis is to share the information set out in the summary at the top of this piece.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1__What_are_the_expected_sales_figures_for_these_books_\">1. What are the expected sales figures for these books?</h2>\n<p>Predicting the number of books sold is far from an exact science. In order to make some rough estimates, we need to draw conclusions from historical data and the behaviour of publishers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Historical_Data\">Historical Data</h3>\n<p><strong> The spread of books sales appears to be power law distributed. </strong>This is supported by a 2007 paper on power law distributions in empirical data, and it matches the experience of most of the industry people I spoke to. (Unfortunately it is very expensive to get access to large datasets on book sales.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9mO45xk0aKiCiwnEoDp7EEcDxcFlaEkVCOrZ4H6PK_TbMqMp-JK-Rf-ZyJUDgjkwy-Rpa_1Pjrf2NVE6CZ6CXFRVa2AOQ-UkR0X1KFKkqqEiNcAe3mzTqshmQ8B1z93bxc2X7Aw\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 2: A sample power law distribution</p>\n<p>Power law distributions are characterised by an initial sharp decline, which then levels out into a long tail. As a result, <strong>the the best-selling books don\u2019t sell twice or three times as many copies as the median books, they sell thousands of times more copies.</strong></p>\n<p>Because of the shape of the distribution, the mean number of sales will also be far higher than the median. This means that the typical or median book sells relatively poorly. <strong>There are different estimates for how many copies the median book sells, but for professionally published books it is probably less than 1000 copies.</strong></p>\n<p>Bearing this in mind, it is predominantly the small chances of extraordinary success that bring up the mean or \u201cexpected\u201d number of book sales to more substantial numbers. <strong>Our goal must be to chase these much higher numbers.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"Publishers__Behaviour\">Publishers\u2019 Behaviour</h3>\n<p>Publishers have their own metrics for estimating a book\u2019s sales, using their own data and industry experience. Unfortunately we don\u2019t have access to these estimates from the publishers of the books in question. However, I have attempted to reconstruct these estimates using the following process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Estimate the size of the advance given to each author, based on media reports, discussions with the authors and my own calculations. (I only know the exact size of William MacAskill\u2019s advance.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Apply the reverse of the \u201cpublisher\u2019s rule of thumb\u201d (which I have learned through my discussions). This is how publishers use their estimated sales to determine the size of the advance given.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong> These figures should be taken as mean best guesses only. </strong>Any errors in my estimate of the advances will scale with the publisher\u2019s formula applied, and in any case the size of the advance may be affected by other factors: for example, the size of William MacAskill\u2019s advance was partly the result of a bidding war between different publishing houses.</p>\n<p>So with that said, <strong>my best guess is that the publishers have estimated the following mean lifetime sales figures for each of the upcoming books:</strong></p>\n<div>\n<table>\n<colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> \n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Author</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Book</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Estimated Sales</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Peter Singer</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>The Most Good You Can Do</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>~20,000 copies</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Nick Cooney</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>How To Be Great At Doing Good</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>~10,000 copies</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>William MacAskill</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Doing Good Better</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>~60,000 copies</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Larissa MacFarquhar</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Strangers Drowning</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>~300,000 copies</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Figure 3: Estimated mean sales based on publishers\u2019 rule of thumb.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Note_that_these_are__mean__lifetime_estimates__not_median_lifetime_estimates__We_should_expect_all_of_the_books_to_do_significantly_worse_than_this_in_the_median_case_\">Note that these are \u2018mean\u2019 lifetime estimates, not median lifetime estimates.

The only downside to this is that her book is the least directly about effective altruism. As a result, we will need to put extra effort into harnessing the interest and momentum built by this book in order to get people more interested in effective altruism.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2__How_much_can_we_boost_the_sales_of_these_books_through_marketing_\">2. How much can we boost the sales of these books through marketing?</h2>\n<p>The success of these books will depend on some combination of marketing (whether by the publisher, specialist marketing firms or vendors), word-of-mouth publicity (which is itself largely determined by the quality of the book) and luck. But how does the interaction between these lead to sales figures?</p>\n<p>I will now introduce a model that is often used to explain power-law distributions, which was suggested to me by Owen Cotton-Barratt.</p>\n<p>Say that five new books are published at pretty much the same time, including one of ours. Let\u2019s suppose that the total number of these books which our target demographic will buy is fixed: the question is how many of these purchases will be of our book rather than one of its rivals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QZvgxRj1JK-Zu_YbfIWlon1YS9IOD6EDILnbvH7ec3MiMzQ7Lt7TbzOgo21MKHeopte3ejlwtfKdS4kxBDm6tNg3pnWMzIrMraE9hck6QjsoUoHFeaVoc-hYHlLVEmawa_FCUbU\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 4: A more complicated toy model of word of mouth influence on book sales.</p>\n<p>In this diagram, book sales are modelled as dots, with each colour corresponding to one of the five books. The initial distribution, shaded at the top, is based primarily on marketing - here it is assumed that the public buy one of each book.</p>\n<p>However, after this point the choice of book for each additional purchase is based on word of mouth, and it is a function of all previously purchased books. In the diagram, it\u2019s based at each stage on a random draw from the previous dots.</p>\n<p>When this process is repeated a large number of times for a large number of initially published books, the frequency of book purchases (or the colours of dots) is described by a power law distribution.</p>\n<p>Now in the real world, the chances of being recommended a book depend not just on the number of people who have read the book before, but also on the quality of the book. So we can add an extra variable to the model, which is the quality of each book.</p>\n<p>Book sales will be a function of n, the number of initial purchasers who bought the book (which depends on marketing), and j, the likelihood of this book being recommended above the others (which depends on quality).</p>\n<p>Working through this model, an increase in n leads to a linear increase in sales; however an increase in j leads to a superlinear increase in sales. <strong>This points towards quality having a greater impact than marketing. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>This model also shows the importance of luck to the process. </strong>In the diagram, the colour green had an equal chance of being picked after the initial distribution. However time after time it was not picked, purely by chance, and each time the chances of it being picked decreased. Marketing could plausibly improve the initial distribution and quality could increase the chances of being picked, but bad luck could bring it all to naught.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3__Once_the_sales_figures_come_in__how_confident_can_we_be_that_our_efforts_made_a_difference_\">3. Once the sales figures come in, how confident can we be that our efforts made a difference?</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, the answer to this is \u201cnot very\u201d. The exception is that if a book sells extremely poorly, we can be pretty sure it would have performed similarly poorly even if we had not marketed it, and that we had very little impact.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Presuming_a_reasonable_degree_of_success__it_is_very_difficult_to_establish_how_much_of_this_is_down_to_marketing__how_much_to_quality_and_how_much_to_luck_\"> Presuming a reasonable degree of success, it is very difficult to establish how much of this is down to marketing, how much to quality and how much to luck.</strong></p>\n<p>There may well be anecdotal data which supports the idea that marketing has made a difference, but even this has limits. For example, one of the key drivers of sales of Nick Bostrom\u2019s Superintelligence was Elon Musk\u2019s tweet about the book. Now, during the marketing phase Nick and his team sent out dozens of copies to thought leaders, including to Elon Musk. But can we be sure that he read the book because of this? Perhaps word of mouth reached him instead? Perhaps it was some combination of the two? Even in a case like this, it is unclear whether the Future of Humanity Institute\u2019s marketing efforts really did make that difference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4__What_does_the_success_or_failure_of_these_books_mean_for_future_publication_attempts_\">4. What does the success or failure of these books mean for future publication attempts?</h2>\n<p>As this is our first foray into publishing, we have had to devote significant resources to learning about the publishing and book marketing worlds. As a result, regardless of whether the book sells well or not, <strong>I would expect that next time around we would need to devote fewer resources to the project.</strong></p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start by imagining that William MacAskill\u2019s book is successful. In this scenario, if he were to write another book he would be more likely to get a good book deal. Also publishers, vendors and the media would be likely to take him more seriously next time around.</p>\n<p>This would probably slightly improve the chances of this book also being a success. However, remember regression to the mean: if this book is particularly successful, we should expect his next book to do less well.</p>\n<p>What about if his books is unsuccessful? Unfortunately, as discussed above it would be difficult for us to determine to what extent this was caused by marketing, quality or luck. The publishers would most likely say that we had simply been unlucky: <strong>most authors do not publish successful books on their first attempt</strong>, and in fact it would be somewhat surprising if Will\u2019s first book was a major success.</p>\n<p>Book publishing is a very high variance industry, and success is to a large degree down to chance or at least factors outside our control. With this in mind, I do not think that a failed first book would be more than a small update against attempting to publish more books in future. I would certainly not be surprised if Will or Peter decided to publish another book, even if this one is not a success.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusions\">Conclusions</h2>\n<p>As I\u2019ve explained above, the vast majority of books sell relatively poorly. The reason that we\u2019ve put our resources into supporting these authors is that there is a chance of them being among the few that sell extremely well. How well they do sell will depend on a combination of marketing, word of mouth and luck, although it\u2019s difficult to attribute success or failure between these factors.</p>\n<p><em> Many thanks to Owen Cotton-Barratt for suggesting the final model I use here, to William MacAskill, Rob Wiblin, Owen Cotton-Barratt and Kerry Vaughan for their thoughts on this piece, and to Peter Orr for extensive copy editing.</em></p></div></div>"},

We orient toward being quite transparent about what we are doing, <a href=\"/ea/qo/promoting_effective_giving_using_liststyle/5v5\">getting feedback</a> from members of the EA community and updating based on that feedback, including <a href=\"/ea/qo/promoting_effective_giving_using_liststyle/5v8\">acknowledging mistakes</a> and trying to improve going forward.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><em><strong>Specific Examples of Our EA Work</strong></em><br></span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>As a specific example of our work, we published <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gleb-tsipursky/how-to-avoid-feeling-chea_b_8635224.html\">this article</a> on The Huffington Post, which was shared on social media over 1K times. A general rule of thumb is that for every person who shares an article on social media, about 100 people read it thoroughly, and many more skim it. This article is impactful for shifting people\u2019s giving toward effective charities. As you'll see from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1079797162070769&amp;id=468695349847623\">this Facebook comment on my personal page</a>, it helped convince someone to decide to donate to effective charities. Furthermore, this comment is someone who is the leader of a large secular group in Houston, and he thus has an impact on a number of other people. Since people <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29\">rarely make actual comments</a>, and far from all are fans of my Facebook page, we can estimate that many more made similar decisions but did not comment about it.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Another example. <a href=\"https://secularstudents.org/givinggame\">Here is a link</a> to the outcome of an Intentional Insights collaboration with The Life You Can Save and the Secular Student Alliance to spread effective giving to secular and skeptic-oriented communities through <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Giving-Games\">Giving Games</a>. This <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Blog/ID/181/How-Sponsoring-Giving-Games-Can-Multiply-the-Impact-of-Your-Donations\">article</a> explains the strong impact of Giving Games, and shows how they direct people\u2019s giving to effective charities.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>These examples illustrate the kind of work that we do: publishing pieces that promote effective giving directly, and collaborating with other organizations to promote effective giving through their channels. To learn more about the methods, assumptions, and impact of Intentional Insights, check out our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JSXZzlit-u4hE-MHNE4DcTr98_bjPhoMPdoI3ECE5Qs/edit?usp=sharing\">Theory of Change</a> and our <a href=\"http://intentionalinsights.org/our-year-by-the-numbers-2015\">Annual Report</a>.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><em><strong>Future Plans</strong></em><br></span></p>\n<p><span>In the next year, we are planning to expand our activities in promoting effective giving in five major directions:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>We aim to experiment with new forms of content, such as <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gleb-tsipursky/8-secrets-of-savvy-donors_b_8792242.html\">list-style articles</a>, memes, and short videos. We want to see what types of content works best for promoting effective giving messages for which specific audiences, and build up a knowledge bank on that topic.</span></li>\n<li><span>While experimenting, we also plan to test rigorously the impact of our content to see what kind of impact our content has on people\u2019s giving behavior. We want to conduct randomized control studies to see whether people change their giving behavior after engaging with InIn content and InIn-sponsored activities such as the Giving Games for secular and skeptic audiences. </span></li>\n<li><span>We want to use our strong connections with US and international secular and skeptic organizations to spread effective giving ideas to these communities. Afterward, we want to spread effective giving to liberal churches such as the Unitarian Universalists, with whom we also have solid connections.</span></li>\n<li><span>We plan to expand our collaboration with EA meta-charities, as well as highly effective direct-action charities. We want to find areas where we can add the most value to the movement based on our internal expertise and capacities, and add that value in a way that benefits all parties. We have had a number of conversations with a variety of different organizations and more are scheduled in the next few weeks (The Life You Can Save, Giving What We Can, EA Action, GiveDirectly, Against Malaria Foundation), and have some promising projects in the works. Likewise, by promoting direct-action charities such as GiveDirectly and AMF, we allow these organizations to save money on their marketing. This helps these organizations appear better in the eyes of less well-educated donors who do not understand the value of spending resources on marketing and want all their money to go toward programming. </span></li>\n<li><span>We would like to develop a resource bank that would enable EAs around the world to promote effective giving to a broad audience. This resource bank would enable EAs in local groups to learn content marketing strategies quickly, with guides for marketing strategies and other tools for this purpose. It would also hold a bank of direct content and templates that promotes effective giving ideas, such as articles, videos, memes, t-shirts, etc. Local EAs would then take whatever they need and adapt it to their local context \u2013 whether translating it to other languages, putting in a hook that ties it to a local event, etc. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><em><strong>Financials</strong></em><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Financially, we have just started our fundraising outside of a narrow circle of initial supporters, since we wanted to get our content to a level where it would be publishable in The Huffington Post. Our basic operations budget is $42050, and we are currently in the red, with the co-founders covering about 88% of the basic expenses, which is not sustainable past the next year. We also want funding to get a new website and integrated donor and financial database, and most importantly hire a staff member, since we are an all-volunteer organization, and that is not sustainable in the long run. You can see our funding breakdown and priorities at the bottom of the <a href=\"http://intentionalinsights.org/our-year-by-the-numbers-2015\">Annual Report</a>.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><em><strong>Conclusion</strong></em><br></span></p>\n<p><span>To conclude, the reason you would support InIn as an EA meta-charity, over a direct-action charity endorsed by GiveWell, is that by doing so you would highly likely direct many more dollars into effective charities than by contributing to direct-action charities themselves. Likewise, you can support InIn effectively with your <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-you-should-focus-more-on-talent-gaps-not-funding-gaps/\">time and talents</a>, while direct-action charities would generally benefit most from financial contributions. Of course, as the section on InIn financial needs discusses, it needs some financial contributions as well, so make your own decisions about what kind of impact you want to see in the world through your donations. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><em><strong>Next Steps</strong></em><br></span></p>\n<p><span>If you would like to support this work to promote effective giving to a broad audience, but are not sure yet how you would like to do so, please fill out this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cv1iXeWs_ePGZ4HGsXmZHinRKvwO93u7eEy-WVoOGzY/viewform?usp=send_form\">supporters form</a>. If you are interested in contributing your time, for example to creating content, providing feedback, or developing the resource bank, please fill out this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/intentionalinsights.org/forms/d/1dD3O_Q1MDyMXmGs9OhfmpoH-CaYExvfOycQX1j0EeJU/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1\">volunteers form</a>. If you are capable of financial donations and are interested in using your dollars to channel the spending of others into effective giving, <a href=\"http://intentionalinsights.org/view/donate\">please donate</a>. The next ten days are a very high-leverage opportunity to donate, as InIn was awarded a <a href=\"http://intentionalinsights.org/10-10-challenge-grant\">challenge grant</a> \u2013 if we get 10 new donors and 10 monthly donors by the end of the year, we will get $2000. So donations from new monthly donors, which double-count, are particularly welcomed. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Thanks again, and I look forward to your thoughts and feedback! You can also PM me on the forum or email me at gleb@intentionalinsights.org<br></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><strong>P.S.</strong> Based on Ryan Carey's suggestions, I want to highlight that InIn is a new project, and promoting effective giving ideas, as opposed to EA as a movement, is a new field of endeavor for EAs. So I would be enthusiastic to learn about what reservations folks have. We are quite open to revising the nature of our work if it seems we are headed in a suboptimal direction, and want to learn more from the community about what the community thinks about what works, </span><span>and proceeding forward in a collaborative truth-seeking spirit about what would most benefit human flourishing.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><strong>EDIT: </strong>Edited based on Ryan Carey's comments below, and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/dotimpact/permalink/529467940554194/\">several comments</a> on the .impact Facebook group. <br></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},

If $200,000 came from Democrats and $260,000 from Republicans, our organisation would donate $400,000 to an effective charity and $60,000 to a Republican super PAC.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Would it really be that easy?</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Maybe?

{"date": "13th Nov 2015", "title": "We care about WALYs not QALYs", "author": "Benjamin_Todd", "num_comments": "18 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>I often see media coverage of effective altruism that says \"effective altruists want to maximise the number of QALYs in the world.\" (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n18/amia-srinivasan/stop-the-robot-apocalypse\">London Review of Books</a>).</p>\n<p>This is wrong. QALYs only measure health, and health is not all that matters. Most effective altruists care about increasing the number of \"WALYs\" or well-being adjusted life years, where health is just one component of wellbeing.</p>\n<p>(Some effective altruists also care about goods besides welfare, such as the environment and justice. Depending on your view of population ethics, you might also distinguish between achieving WALYs by improving lives vs. adding to the number of people alive).</p>\n<p>This is a bad misconception since it makes it look like we have a laughably narrow view of what's good. Even a hardcore hedonistic utilitarian would at least care about *happiness* rather than just health, and very few people are hedonistic utilitarians.</p>\n<p>Why does effective altruism get misinterpreted as thinking we only care about QALYs?</p>\n<p>1) Sometimes community members actually say \"we want to maximise the number of QALYs\". I think we should stop doing this. Instead say something more like: \"we want to maximise the number of people who have good lives\", or just \"maximise the good we do\" and then if someone asks what \"good\" means, you can say it's people having happy or flourishing lives.</p>\n<p>2) Sometimes when people ask us \"how do you measure 'good'?\" we talk about QALYs as an example. This is what happens in Will's book. I think this is a reasonable move - the idea of QALYs is really important to introduce to new people - but it can create the impression that you only care about QALYs. The QALY bit will be the most memorable, and people won't remember your disclaimers. This means if you're explaining QALYs you need to put a lot of emphasis on how that's not all that matters. You can do this by instead leading with \"you can measure your impact by choosing good proxies within the cause you're working in e.g. in health there's QALYs, in education you can look at improvements in test scores and income, in economic empowerment programs you can look at income change, and so on. Use the best proxies you have available.\" Alternatively you can introduce the idea of QALYs, but then point out what we ultimately care about is welfare; it's just that right now health is the cause where quantification is easiest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Edit: I don't propose publicly promoting and using the term \"WALYs\" - just bear in mind \"WALYs not QALYs\" to help you remember. (My suggestions about what to say publicly are just above in 1 and 2).</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "27th Jan 2015", "title": "On making spaces friendlier to parents", "author": "Julia_Wise", "num_comments": "20 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>Julia and her husband run an effective altruism meetup series in Boston. They have a 10-month-old daughter. This post is adapted from Julia's <a href=\"https://thewholesky.wordpress.com/2015/01/27/why-i-take-my-kid-almost-everywhere/\">blog</a>.</em></p>\n<p>.....</p>\n<p>I've been thinking about how a social scene becomes more or less friendly to parents and children, and why it might be in the interest of the Effective Altruism movement to be more friendly.</p>\n<p>Jeff's and my social life has mostly been composed of three circles, two well-established and one newer.</p>\n<p>The folk dance scene is well-established. Lots of people got into it during the folk revival of the 1970s, and now there are lots of second-generation dancers my age. Both baby boomers and 20-somethings are\u00a0excited about a new generation coming into the traditions. The activities themselves are fairly child-friendly\u2014you can wear a baby or toddler while contra dancing, and children can start dancing themselves once they're about 5. The women's Morris team I dance with are 30 of Lily's biggest fans, and we're never short of helping hands when we tour with them. I've heard older women say that the reason our team has never lacked for members is that it was supportive of young mothers in the 1980s, and those women came back, bringing their daughters and their daughters' friends. Some other teams lost a wave of women at the point that nobody would help them hold the baby at a gig.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Relatedly, I understand this is why Google gives more generous parental and especially <a href=\"http://www.today.com/money/googles-formula-retain-women-longer-maternity-leave-962541\">maternity leave</a>\u00a0than most American companies. They wanted to reduce the high attrition rate of female engineers, who were especially likely to quit after having children. The longer maternity leave has indeed reduced attrition.)</p>\n<p>We're not really active in Quaker circles anymore, but our meeting was very child-friendly, in part because it was founded 30 years ago to be more child-friendly than the other local meeting. As with Morris, a few decades ago there was a shift from seeing childcare as something that the child's own mother was expected to provide at all times to something that was more supported by the community.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then there's our third social circle, the effective altruist/rationalist scene (I realize these are separate scenes in most places, but in Boston they're pretty intertwined.) It's made almost entirely of young childless people. There are more child-free-by-choice people and more antinatalist ideology, both of which are fine with me. The activities themselves are less child-friendly, in that intellectual discussion is harder to do while someone is making silly squealing noises in the corner. As Lily comes into the awkward age of being too old to play quietly on the floor and too young to follow the conversation, I expect it will be harder to keep her quietly amused. So there's a question of how much Lily will tolerate adult activities, and how much our friends will tolerate Lily being a child.</p>\n<p>.....</p>\n<p>So why wouldn't parents just use a babysitter?</p>\n<p>Imagine we went to an afternoon discussion group - we'd need to spend time finding and screening sitters, then arrange with one who was available at that time. If we're gone 3 hours (plus 30 minutes to show the sitter around and let the child get acquainted), at the $12/hour going rate in our city, that's a total of $42. For us, that's an expensive afternoon out.</p>\n<p>Also, maybe this is just me being a first-time parent and believing my child is more of a fragile flower than she is, but our one experience with a sitter did not go all that well, even with someone I thought was going to be totally capable. And my kid doesn't reliably eat for other people, so we don't want to come home to find her crying with hunger (it's happened). I<span>f using sitters works for your family, great! It just hasn't worked for us.</span></p>\n<p>For breastfeeding mothers, being away from the baby for a significant amount of time means needing to pump milk. Bringing Lily with me and feeding her at a gathering is easier and more fun than washing the pump parts, packing it all up, excusing myself to the bathroom during the event to pump alone, and keeping the milk cold until we get home. To be away from her for something as long as a weekend would mean way more pumping and stockpiling of milk than I am willing to do. At this point she won't drink formula, so we can't just switch her main food at whim.</p>\n<p>I think it's good for Lily to see more than the same few rooms and toys every day. She's interested in seeing different places and faces.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, I love\u00a0Lily and I like having her near me. It's not surprising that parents would evolve this way.</p>\n<p>.....</p>\n<p>The only really negative comment I got when I was pregnant was \"I guess that's okay, as long as I never have to see the kid or hear it.\" This was from an organizer of a meetup (not an EA meetup) we had attended for years, and I nearly interpreted it as a command not to come back once I had a child in tow. Jeff assures me the person must have meant it as a joke. I didn't think it was a good joke.</p>\n<p>I don't like dogs, and I've encountered service dogs that were about as badly-behaved as my baby (making noise, trying to eat other people's belongings). But I would never tell somebody I didn't want to see them if they were going to bring their dog.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm fine with some spaces being kept quiet and tidy\u2014performances, parties that have been announced as adult-only, etc. But there are a lot of borderline cases. Can I bring my baby to an academic conference? To a panel where I'm a panelist? (I've been assuming the answer is \"yes\" for those two, and nobody has stopped me.) Is a baby babbling or a toddler whispering more distracting than an adult coughing? Or an adult\u00a0with a hissing oxygen machine? If we would be okay with those adults present, I'd say we should also be okay with a reasonably quiet child. Jeff and I do remove Lily if we think she's too distracting or loud, but I think minor child noises should be considered acceptable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I recognize the element of choice here\u2014I chose to have a baby, and people who need service animals or oxygen machines did not choose to need those things. But I think supporting the continuation of humanity and the socialization of the next generation can be considered a pretty basic part of human life. I understand that you may really dislike children. But understand that if you don't want children in your presence or at your event, it's not only the child you exclude. It's me.</p>\n<p>.....</p>\n<p>It's not just when children are brought to events that these issues come up.</p>\n<p>Years ago I went out with a friend a few months after the birth of her son. It was her first time out without him. We went to the swing dance at MIT, and a young man there (probably an MIT student) asked her what she did for a living.</p>\n<p>\"I'm a stay-at-home mom,\" she answered.</p>\n<p>\"Oh, that's weird,\" he said.</p>\n<p>She was too jangled to ask what he meant by that, so we'll never know. In his life in a mostly-male top-notch academic enclave (sound like anyone you know?), he probably didn't know any stay-at-home parents. So maybe he meant \"I don't know anyone with that occupation.\" Maybe he meant, \"You seem too smart for that.\" (In fact, I think parenting was more rewarding than the PhD program she had quit.) Maybe it was just his default response when he was surprised.</p>\n<p>If your life does not include any stay-at-home mothers (or any construction workers, or any other group you don't have much contact with), take a moment now and reflect that this is not actually a weird occupation. If this is your default thing to say when you are surprised, please think of a different thing to say.</p>\n<p>.....</p>\n<p>I've heard discussion about whether having children is a good way to increase the number of people in the EA community. I don't think it is per se, because it's much faster to talk to other adults than to raise people from infancy. Hosting an EA discussion group is probably a much better way to spread these ideas than having children. I was an antinatalist myself for a long time, and though I no longer agree with those ideas, I can understand why other people hold them.</p>\n<p>But this is not about whether you like children, or whether you agree with having children in principle. It's about who you welcome in. A large proportion of adults are parents, and to exclude parents is to keep this a movement with an unnecessarily narrow demographic.</p>\n<p>.....</p>\n<p>What can you do to make spaces more welcoming to parents and children? (These suggestions are mostly based on my experience with babies. Parents of older children can chime in with their suggestions.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Say, \"It's good to see you. I'm glad you could come!\"\u00a0</li>\n<li>Converse with the parent like they are a normal person. It's fine to talk about the baby or not. But consider that they probably came to an effective altruism discussion to talk about effective altruism, and allow time for that.</li>\n<li>Don't give a young child food or objects without asking. You'd be surprised at what kids can tear up and choke on.</li>\n<li>If the parent is having a hard time juggling coat, shoes, baby, and bags, ask if you can hold anything.</li>\n<li>If there's a quiet space (like a bedroom or a sofa in another room) that you're okay with them using, offer to let the parent use it for feeding or hanging out with a fussy child. Bonus: now you don't have to be in the same room with said fussy child. It's probably a good idea to mention this as a general offer\u00a0<em>before</em>\u00a0the child gets fussy, so\u00a0it doesn't come across as\u00a0a veiled \"Your child is annoying me; please remove it.\"</li>\n<li>Offer to hold or supervise the child while the parent goes to the bathroom or gets something to eat.</li>\n<li>Spend some time talking with an older child\u2014do they have questions about the discussion? What is their favorite book? Do they like animals? Did they do anything fun this week?</li>\n<li>If the child really is disrupting the event, an organizer can take the parent aside\u00a0and figure out a plan (\"I'm worried that people can't hear the discussion well. Is there anything I can do to help? Would you be able to take your child to another room while she calms down?\")</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You don't have to do all these things if you're not comfortable with them, but the first one would be a really good start.</p>\n<p>Lots of people in this movement have been very nice to my family. Thank you! Keep up the good work!</p></div></div>"},

As such, hopefully these metrics are already being collected internally, and publicly sharing them should not be very difficult, though very valuable. If not, GWWC should start collecting them!</p>\n<p>GWWC already publishes the <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/dashboard\"><span>number of members</span></a> it has at any given point and the total amount pledged. From this it\u2019s easy to derive how many joined in any given year. However, it\u2019s hard to judge what these people did later \u2013 how many fulfilled the pledge, and how much did they donate? Worse, this makes it hard to forecast the value of a new member, so we can\u2019t tell how much effort we should put into extensive growth. As far as I can see (sorry if I just couldn\u2019t find the data), we do not currently release the data required to make this analysis.</p>\n<p>As part of it\u2019s annual report, GWWC should release data on each cohort: how many of that cohort fulfilled the pledge by donating 10%; how many were \u2018excused\u2019 from donating 10%<em> ( e.g. by being students)</em>; how many failed to abide by the pledge, donating less than 10% despite having an income; and how many did not respond.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Example_Disclosure\">Example Disclosure</h3>\n<p>In case it\u2019s confusing what exactly I\u2019m suggesting GWWC release, here\u2019s an example (with totally made-up numbers).

Are the members who joined in 2012 more likely to still be a member in good standing in 2014 than they 2010 cohort were in 2012? Do they donate more or less?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are some other numbers that might be nice to know, for example breaking the data down by age, sex, nationality, or even CEA employee vs non-employee, but it\u2019s important not to impose too high a reporting burden.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Why_this_is_not_idle_speculation\">Why this is not idle speculation</h3>\n<p>This might seem a bit ambitious. Yes, it would be nice if GWWC released this data. But is it really a pressing issue?</p>\n<p>I think it is.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Bank_problems__Extend_and_Pretend\">Bank problems: Extend and Pretend</h4>\n<p>Sometimes banks will make a series of bad loans \u2013 loans which are repaid at a significantly lower than expected rate, perhaps because the bank was trying to grow aggressively. When the first signs of this emerge, like people being late on payments, banks have two alternatives. The honest one is to admit there is a problem and \u2018write down\u2019 the loan \u2013 take a loss to profits. The perhaps less honest one is to <a href=\"http://mathbabe.org/2012/05/29/when-extend-and-pretend-becomes-delay-and-pray/\"><span>extend and pretend</span></a> \u2013 give the borrowers more time to repay and pretend to yourself/auditors/investors that they will come good in the end. This doesn\u2019t actually create any value; it just delays the day of reckoning. Worse, it propagates bad information in the meantime, causing people to make bad decisions.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately they neglected the Litany of Gendlin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is true is already so.<br> Owning up to it doesn\u2019t make it worse.<br> Not being open about it doesn\u2019t make it go away.<br> And because it\u2019s true, it is what is there to be interacted with.<br> Anything untrue isn\u2019t there to be lived.<br> People can stand what is true,<br> for they are already enduring it.<br> <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/id/you_can_face_reality/\"><em>\u2014Eugene Gendlin</em></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"GWWC__Dilutive_Growth_\">GWWC: Dilutive Growth?</h4>\n<p>About a year ago, people were concerned that GWWC\u2019s growth was slowing \u2013 <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2014/01/recent-linear-growth-at-giving-what-we.html\"><span>only growing linearly, rather than exponentially</span></a>. This would be pretty bad, and people were justifiably concerned. However, GWWC made a few changes with the aim of promoting growth. Most pertinently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allowing people to sign up online, rather than having to mail in a hand-signed paper form. This happened between <span><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20130423151736/http://givingwhatwecan.org/getting-involved/joining-us\">April </a></span>and <span><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20130814223723/http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/taking-the-pledge\">June </a></span>2013.</li>\n<li>Adjusting the pledge to become more cause-neutral, rather than just about global poverty. This happened late 2014.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/gwwc-signups-labeled.png\"><img src=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/gwwc-signups-labeled.png?w=681&amp;h=574\" alt=\"GWWC signups labeled\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/dashboard\"><span><em>source</em></span></a></p>\n<p>The concern is that, though these measures have <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/dashboard\"><span>increased the number of members</span></a>, they may have done so by reducing the average quality of members. Making it easier to join means more marginal people, with less attachment to the idea, can join. This is still good if their membership adds value, but they dilute the membership, which means we shouldn\u2019t account for the average new member being signed up now as being equally valuable as the members who joined up in 2010. Additionally, the reduction in pomp and circumstance might reduce the gravitas of the pledge, making people take it less seriously and increase drop-out rates. If so, moving to paperless pledges might have reduced the value of sub-marginal members <em>as well as</em> diluting them. This makes it harder to forecast the value of members, and might lead to over-investment in acquiring new ones.</p>\n<p>The comparison with banks should be pretty clear \u2013 a bank that\u2019s struggling to grow starts accepting less creditworthy applicants so it can keep putting up good short term numbers, but at the cost of reducing the long-run profitability. Similarly GWWC, struggling to grow, starts accepting lower quality members so it can keep putting up good short term numbers, but at the cost of reducing the long-run donations.</p>\n<p>This seems potentially a big risk, and it\u2019s the sort of issue that this data would allow us to address. Of course, there are many other applications of the data as well.</p>\n<p>And GWWC in fact has even stronger reasons than banks to report this data. The bank might be wary of giving information to its competitors, but GWWC has no such concerns. Indeed, if releasing more data makes it easier for someone else to launch a competing, better version of GWWC, all the better!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>If you liked this you might also like: <a href=\"https://effectivereaction.wordpress.com/2014/11/15/happy-5th-birthday-giving-what-we-can/\"><span>Happy 5th Birthday, Giving What We Can</span></a> and <a href=\"https://effectivereaction.wordpress.com/2014/10/12/givewell-is-not-an-index-fund/\"><span>GiveWell is not an Index Fund</span></a></em></p>\n</div></div></div>"},

Giving What We Can's recommendations have been static for several years. To estimate what rate of churn we should expect, I examine the age distribution of GiveWell (and Giving What We Can) recommended charities. For top international aid charities, typical age is a decade or less, possibly a result of focus on smaller organizations narrowly focused on interventions with recent funding gaps.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong id=\"What_does_stability_in_GiveWell_and_Giving_What_We_Can_recommendations_mean_\">What does stability in GiveWell and Giving What We Can recommendations mean?</strong></p>\n<p>This year's\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">list of top charity and standout charity recommendations</a>\u00a0from charity evaluator GiveWell are identical to those of 2014, although GiveWell has provided firmer guidance for AMF as the target for marginal donations after Good Ventures has filled the most urgent funding needs of the other recommended charities. Likewise, Giving What We Can's\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/top-charities/\">recommendations</a>\u00a0are the same as 2014 and 2013. What should we infer from this (tiny) bit of information?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the one hand, improving charity evaluation (at least for a given set of criteria, which may be evaluated themselves) should have diminishing returns as it converges toward the truth, or at least reasonable estimates. If every charity were perfectly evaluated, then changes in rankings would occur only as the effectiveness and room for more funding of existing charities shifted, or new ones were added.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the other hand, ratings might be stable because of insufficient work in finding new charities to recommend, before approaching an ideal level of evaluation. GiveWell has expanded its staff recently, but many senior staff have shifted effort towards the Open Philanthropy Project or training the new hires.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One indirect piece of evidence is the age distribution of recommended charities. If charities that meet the criteria for recommendation tend to be older, then there will be fewer new entrants that might qualify for recommendation in a given year, and we should expect more stability than if qualifying charities tend to be young. So I went over GiveWell and Giving What We Can recommendations from 2008-2015 to find median and mean ages of recommended charities and put them in a\u00a0<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gyI8l-5wU70HwRQkf6KnWRxLRnfU1bTO3yJsVYgvIpY/edit?usp=sharing\">Google Sheet</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"GiveWell_recommendations__all_\">GiveWell recommendations (all)</strong></p>\n<p>For my first pass I looked at all charities recommended by GiveWell, including 'standout,' 'silver,' and U.S. domestic charities.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<table>\n<colgroup><col><col><col><col><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup> \n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\u00a0</td>\n<td>\n<p>2008</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2009</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2010</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2011</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2012</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2013</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2014</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>2015</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Median age</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>21</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>15</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>13</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>9</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>8</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>6</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>9.5</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>10.5</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Mean age</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>23.2</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>17.4</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>15.125</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>10.75</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>7</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>7</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>11.25</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>12.25</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The earlier years are \u00a0dragged up by the several U.S. charities, which tended to be older, and Partners in Healh and Population Services International.

For the list of 8 top and standout charities I would hope to see more charities emerge soon, although it would be unsurprising for AMF to remain 'on top' longer. GiveWell's increasing money moved, especially through Good Ventures, may also accelerate change by shifting room for more funding and actively cultivating new charities with participation grants and funding of randomized controlled trials.</p></div></div>"},

You can post questions in this thread in the meantime. Here is some more background:<br><br>I am Executive Director of the <a href=\"http://gcrinstitute.org/\">Global Catastrophic Risk Institute</a> (GCRI). I co-founded GCRI in 2011 with <a href=\"http://tony-barrett.com/\">Tony Barrett</a>. GCRI is an independent, nonprofit think tank studying major risks to the survival of human civilization. We develop practical, effective ways to reduce the risks.<br><br>There is often some confusion among effective altruists about how GCRI uses the term \u201cglobal catastrophic risk\u201d. The bottom line is that we focus on risk of catastrophes that could cause major permanent harm. This is similar to some use of \u201cexistential risk\u201d. You can read more about that <a href=\"http://gcrinstitute.org/concept\">here</a>.<br><br>GCRI <a href=\"http://gcrinstitute.org/february-newsletter-new-directions-for-gcri\">just announced</a> major changes to GCRI\u2019s identity and direction. We are focusing increasingly on in-house research oriented towards assessing the best ways of reducing the risks. This is at the heart of our new flagship <a href=\"http://gcrinstitute.org/integrated-assessment\">integrated assessment project</a>, which puts all the gcrs into one study to learn the best risk reduction opportunities.<br><br>If you\u2019d like to stay up to date on GCRI, you can sign up for our monthly <a href=\"http://gcrinstitute.org/newsletter.html\">email newsletter</a>. You can also support GCRI by <a href=\"http://gcrinstitute.org/donate\">donating</a>.<br>And GCRI is not active on social media, but you can follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SethBaum\">Twitter</a>.<br><br>I am excited to have this chance to speak with the online effective altruism community. I was involved in the online utilitarianism community around 2006-2007 via my <a href=\"http://felicifia.blogspot.com\">Felicifia blog</a>. I\u2019m really impressed with how the community has grown. A lot of people have put a lot of work into this. Thanks go in particular to Ryan Carey for setting up today\u2019s AMA and for doing so much more.<br><br>There are also a few things I\u2019m hoping to learn from you:<br><br>First, I am considering a research project on what motivates people to take on major global issues and/or to act on altruistic principles more generally. I would be interested in any resources you know of about this. It could be research on altruism/global issues in general or research on what motivates people to pursue effective altruism.<br><br>Second, I am interested in what you think are major open questions in gcr/xrisk. Are you facing decisions to get involved in gcr/xrisk, or to take certain actions to reduce the risks? For these decisions, is there information that would help you figure out what to do? Your answers here can help inform the directions GCRI pursues for its research. We aspire to help people make better decisions to more effectively reduce the risks.</p></div></div>"},

These all have unknown but probably very low chances of making a breakthrough, but could nevertheless be completely reasonable things to try to do.</p>\n<p>Here's a similar thing I wrote years ago: <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/09/if-elections-arent-a-pascals-mugging-existential-risk-shouldnt-be-either.html\">If elections aren't a Pascal's Mugging, existential risk work shouldn't be either</a>.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Postscript\"> Postscript</strong></p>\n<p>As far as I can see all of these are open possibilities:</p>\n<p>1) Solving the AI safety problem will turn out to be unnecessary, and our fears today are founded on misunderstandings about the problem.</p>\n<p>2) Solving the AI safety problem will turn out to be relative straightforward on the timeline available.</p>\n<p>3) It will be a close call whether we manage to solve it in time - it will depend on how hard we work and when we start.</p>\n<p>4) Solving the AI safety problem is almost impossible and we would have to be extremely lucky to do so before creating a super-intelligent machine. We are therefore probably screwed.</p>\n<p>We collectively haven't put enough focussed work into the problem yet to have a good idea where we stand. But that's hardly a compelling reason to assume 1), 2) or 4) and not work on it now.</p></div></div>"},

href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/nf/political_debiasing_and_the_political_bias_test/\">Political Debiasing and the Political Bias Test</a>\u201d. Connected to \u201c<a href=\"/ea/9s/effective_altruism_is_a_question_not_an_ideology/\">Effective altruism is a Question (not an Ideology)</a>\"</span></em></p>\n<p><span>There are a number of different psychological effects which contribute to political bias. These include the </span><span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect\"><span>halo effect</span></a></span><span>, </span><span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishful_thinking\"><span>wishful thinking</span></a></span><span> and </span><span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\"><span>confirmation bias</span></a></span><span>, all of which can cause people\u2019s political values to colour their factual beliefs. This obviously leads to a correlation between values and factual beliefs. For instance, those who believe that the market is just will also think it\u2019s efficient, and vice versa. </span></p>\n<p><span>All of these psychological mechanisms operate so to say on the individual level. They cause individuals\u2019 interpretation of evidence to be influenced by their political values, but not by other people. What makes things worse, however, is that there are social structures which underwrite bias. Once the correlation between values and factual beliefs among groups of people is established, social biases kick in. </span></p>\n<p><span>To see that, suppose that political group <em>X</em> is, from the start, defined solely by its values - say \u201cthe market is just\u201d (this is rather unusual, but let\u2019s grant this for the sake of the argument). Because of the aforementioned biases, most <em>X</em>-ers soon start believing that the market also is effective. This becomes the normal belief in the group, and what\u2019s <em>normal </em>usually starts becoming the <em>norm </em>among political groups. Hence, the definition of <em>X</em> is changed. Believing that the market is effective becomes part of what it means to be an <em>X</em>-er. It doesn\u2019t perhaps become completely impossible to stay an <em>X</em>-er if you don\u2019t believe that the market is effective, but it definitely is frowned upon by your in-group.</span></p>\n<p><span>In fact, the normal state of affairs is that membership in a political group is defined <em>both </em>by certain political values <em>and </em>certain factual beliefs. (Also, values and factual beliefs typically aren\u2019t clearly distinguished.) This makes it hard for group members to evaluate their factual beliefs objectively. If they do so, and come to the wrong conclusion, they may have to leave their political group. </span><span><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/4/6/5556462/brain-dead-how-politics-makes-us-stupid\"><span>Vox.com:s Ezra Klein quotes political psychologist Dan Kahan.</span></a></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>[I]f [an ordinary member of the public] forms the wrong position on climate change relative to the one that people with whom she has a close affinity \u2013 and on whose high regard and support she depends on in myriad ways in her daily life \u2013 she could suffer extremely unpleasant consequences, from shunning to the loss of employment.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span>\u2026</span></p>\n<p><span>Kahan calls this theory Identity-Protection Cognition: \u201cAs a way of avoiding dissonance and estrangement from valued groups, individuals subconsciously resist factual information that threatens their defining values.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>Clearly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_cognition\">Identity-Protection Cognition</a> \u2013 which is a social bias, unlike, e.g. the halo effect \u2013 is a major cause of political bias. How could we reduce it?</span></p>\n<p><span>I think that if we retain the definition of Effective Altruism as a social movement that is trying to do good as effectively as possible, the EA movement has a good chance of reducing this particular type of political bias. This is because unlike standard political ideologies, <em>the EA movement is not defined by any factual beliefs </em>(beyond extremely general ones, such as \u201creason and evidence are good ways of finding out about the world\u201d). The EA movement is not defined, e.g. by any particular conception of the market economy, or any other factual view. Thus you can give up more or less all of your factual beliefs and still remain an Effective altruist. This means that EAs should feel much freer to evaluate factual claims objectively. </span></p>\n<p><span>EA members are not immune to individual biases like the halo effect and confirmation bias, however. (To reduce them, we have to use other means than those discussed in this post.) Hence, they are likely to end up with factual beliefs which match their political values to some extent, just like other people. There\u2019s therefore a risk that these factual beliefs start becoming part of the definition of Effective altruism (this was precisely what happened with our hypothetical ideology <em>X</em>). To avoid this, it is important that we make a conscious effort to retain the original definition of the EA movement. </span></p>\n<p><span>Here I think explicitness helps. Most ideologies aren\u2019t very explicitly defined (at least not beyond the groves of the academy), which facilitates drift. Witness, e.g. the drift of the term \u201cliberal\u201d (which is left-wing in the US, but right-wing in Scandinavia). To avoid such drift we need to discuss and emphasize the meaning of \u201cEffective altruism\u201d over and over again.</span></p>\n<p><span>Could Effective altruism also contribute to reducing political bias in society at large? One can only speculate on this. I certainly think that working to reduce political bias is a worthwhile cause for effective altruists, as I made clear in my <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/nf/political_debiasing_and_the_political_bias_test/\">last post on the topic</a>. Presumably, when effective altruists do so, they could refer to the EA movement\u2019s impartial attitude to factual issues, and suggest non-EAs to adopt it. More generally, the EA movement could do a great deal of good by making non-EA-groups adopt part of their message in this way.</span></p>\n<p><span>Let me finish with a general historical reflection. Fundamentalist religions and oppressive political ideologies \u2013 such as Nazism or Soviet communism \u2013 prohibit people from expressing certain factual beliefs \u2013 e.g., the belief that God does not exist. Thankfully, they have little power in the Western world today. The democratic political ideologies that dominate in the West do allow you to question factual beliefs.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, most of these ideologies still discourage you from questioning certain factual beliefs which are integral to them. In other words, they are <em>partial </em>on certain factual issues. This is not enough \u2013 we need to go all the way and <em>create a level playing-field for all factual views</em>. Effective altruism, with, its refusal to commit to any factual belief, is uniquely well-suited for that.</span></p>\n<p></p></div></div>"},

The entire writeup can be viewed <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByFxvhXPmbsiUkVXRDI5N1JBOWc/view?usp=sharing\">here</a>, but the major results (taken from the introduction) are given below. I'm happy to answer any questions in the comments, and if anyone wants to view the full data set we collected, I can talk with the folks at TLYCS about getting it to you. Thanks again for the helpful comments and critique you all provided at the outset of this pilot, and hopefully these results will be useful to someone down the line.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Life You Can Save (TLYCS) ran a test-pilot for a grass roots pamphleting program during Spring of 2015. On five separate outings during May and June, roughly 3500 pamphlets were handed out to students on Los Angeles area university campuses. The metrics of interest for the pilot were the number of visitors to the TLYCS website generated by the pamphlets, and the associated cost per visitor.</p>\n<p>In post-pilot analysis, the estimated acquisition rate of website visitors per-pamphlet for these outings was between 0.6 % and 1.1 %. This translates to a $125 to $70 cost per-website visitor at the $0.75 price-per-unit TLYCS paid for the pamphlets. However, this cost could be straightforwardly reduced to between $12 to $6 per-website visitor by more economically sourcing the pamphlets.</p>\n<p>There is reason to believe that a more focused, strategic pamphlet design, along with offering an incentive in the pamphlet, could have driven up the acquisition rate. However, even a doubling of the rate would not have produced a per-visitor cost on par with TLYCS\u2019s online advertising efforts. Therefore a decision was made in the wake of the pilot to discontinue the program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>FYI, the previous posts on this topic are:</p>\n<p>http://effective-altruism.com/ea/dg/tlycs_pamphleting_pilot_program/</p>\n<p>http://effective-altruism.com/ea/eh/tlycs_pamphleting_pilot_plan/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},

They could just give the organization $5M, but instead they decide to try and help the organization find some small donors to spread its reach. The foundation offers to match donations up to $2.5M. This is a real match: they will give $1 for every $1 anyone else gives, up to their limit. When the match is over, however, if the funding gap still hasn't been met they plan to make up the difference.</p>\n<p>Let's consider some possiblities: <!-- td{text-align:right} --> \n</p><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Amount Raised</th> <th>Match Given</th> <th>Makeup Contribution</th> <th>Total Received</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$0</td>\n<td>$0</td>\n<td>$5M</td>\n<td>$5M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$100K</td>\n<td>$100K</td>\n<td>$4.8M</td>\n<td>$5M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$200K</td>\n<td>$200K</td>\n<td>$4.6M</td>\n<td>$5M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$1M</td>\n<td>$1M</td>\n<td>$3M</td>\n<td>$5M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$2M</td>\n<td>$2M</td>\n<td>$1M</td>\n<td>$5M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$2.5M</td>\n<td>$2.5M</td>\n<td>$0</td>\n<td>$5M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$3M</td>\n<td>$2.5M</td>\n<td>$0</td>\n<td>$5.5M</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$4M</td>\n<td>$2.5M</td>\n<td>$0</td>\n<td>$6.5M</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nIf the organization raises less than $2.5M from small donors they end up with a total of $5M regardless of the amount the small donors give. This is described as a 1:1 match, but because their \"makeup contribution\" acts as a 1:-2 match the overall effect on the charity is actually a 1:-1 match: for every dollar you give they'll give one fewer! By donating to the organization you're effectively donating to the foundation, by leaving them with more money to do other things. [1]\n<p>Most donation matching isn't this extreme, but this example shows the main consideration in donation matching: how is the world different if you do donate versus if you don't? This is counterfactual reasoning, and in the case of donation matching it's specifically a question of <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/counterfactual-trust\">counterfactual trust</a>. You trust them to match your donation if you give one, but do you trust that your donation is necessary to prompt them to give?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/\">Ben Kuhn</a> recently ran a <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/matching-results\">survey</a> to try to understand what people expect when they donate to a matching campaign. His questions looked like:</p>\n<blockquote>Good Ventures today announced $5M in matching funds for donations made to GiveDirectly from 2013-12-03 through 2014-01-31. All donations to GiveDirectly during the period, up to $100,000 per donor, will be counted toward the match. <br>...<br> Suppose that, over the time period the match was active, GiveDirectly raised $4.5M. If you had donated $10 to GiveDirectly at that time, how much <em>more money</em> would they have received than if you had not donated anything?</blockquote>\n<p>This is asking us how much we trust GiveDirectly's match to be counterfactually valid. If we think they would have just gone ahead and donated the $5M regardless then we'd answer $10, while if we think they'll would only donate in response to our donation we'd answer $20. If we weren't sure how much to trust the match we might say something between $10 and $20.</p>\n<p>Ben writes that $20 seems to have been accurate here:</p>\n<blockquote>Interestingly, for both the Good Ventures and HCEA matches, we can check people's beliefs against reality. For Good Ventures, we can look at <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/03/good-ventures-matching-gift-to-givedirectly-and-grants-to-top-charities/\">GiveWell's blog post</a> on the match:\n<blockquote>If the full amount of the match is reached, we believe Good Ventures will be giving more in total to our top charities this year than they would have been had a match not been a possibility.</blockquote>\nThe wording \"If the full amount... is reached\" suggests that Good Ventures was in fact planning to donate only the amount matched, so at least on the margin the match was fully counterfactual.</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately \"fully counterfactual\" is too strong. Good Ventures has a bunch of money that they intend to give to the most effective charities they can, and this is great! But their plan to use the money as close to optimally as possible means this money can't actually be swayed very much. Say I give $10 to Give Directly and Good Ventures matches my donation with $10 they wouldn't otherwise donate this year. If I hadn't donated, however, they would have kept that $10 to spend in a later year on an opportunity they consider approximately as valuable.</p>\n<p>Why do I say \"approximately as valuable\"? Good Ventures is run by clear thinking people who want to have as big a positive impact on the world as they can. If they thought that Give Directly represented a better opportunity for giving than they were likely to see in the future they would donate more to it until that was no longer the case, and vice versa. The only reason they're willing to offer a match is that they don't have a precise target for Give Directly in mind and they think the benefit of bringing in more donors outweighs the benefit of being slightly more deliberate about which donations happen in one year vs another.</p>\n<p>There's one little gap here, however, which we can get a good bit of mileage out of. What I describe only holds if you and the matcher have approximately the same values. If you, say, think current people matter far more than future people, however, then taking Good Ventures up on their match is great, because it gets them to spend money now instead of delaying and spending it on others later. This situation is most apparent with \"general\" donation matches, like an employer offering to match donations to any 501(c)3 organization. If the size of the employer pool is not fixed or you plan to give to a charity you think is much more effective than the 501(c)3s the money would otherwise go to, the counterfactual effect of your donation really is doubled.</p>\n<p>There's a spectrum here, from \"funder negates your match\" through \"funder ignores your match\" through \"funder acts on your match but would otherwise fund something about as valuable (to you)\" up to \"funder acts on your match and would otherwise fund something much less valuable (to you)\". A good guideline is to respect a match only when the match is untargeted, when the funder is willing to match donations to any charity: this matches up almost exactly with when matches are fully counterfactually valid. [2]</p>\n<p>(Similarly you shouldn't offer a fully general match, because charities <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/charity-variance-vision\">vary</a> <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/the-unintuitive-power-laws-of-giving\">dramatically</a> in their effectiveness. [3] If you would like something with the social proof benefits of matching but without the dishonesty of misleading people about the effects of their donation, consider making a donation and then <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/matching-results#consider-running-a-challenge-instead-of-a-match\">challenging</a> others to do the same.)</p>\n<p><small><em>I also posted this <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/the-counterfactual-validity-of-donation-matching\">on my blog</a>.</em></small></p>\n<p><br> [1] Intent matters a lot here in figuring dishonesty. If the funder planned from the beginning to hit a target regardless of other people's actions that's bad, but if instead after failing to hit a target they decide to be generous and gill the gap that sounds good. Yet both are the same from a counterfactual reasoning perspective: they give one dollar fewer for every dollar you give.</p>\n<p>[2] This is the only situation in which I'll list a match on our <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/donations\">donations page</a>. I still don't count it toward my goal of <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/giving-half\">50%</a> for the year, but I think counting it that way would be defensible.)</p>\n<p>[3] Tomasik <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/why-charities-dont-differ-astronomically-in-cost-effectiveness/\">claims to disagree</a>, but this is a matter of degree. While he rejects claims 1000x claims of variance he does \"suspect many charities differ by at most ~10 to ~100 times, and within a given field, the multipliers are probably less than a factor of ~5\" which is strong enough to argue against fully general matches, and probably field-restricted matches as well.</p></div></div>"},

Most participants we\u2019ve spoken to found the experience inspiring. The people there were devoted to doing good, with incredible personal stories and exciting projects.</span></strong></p><strong>\n<br>\n<p><span>Unfortunately, the event raised concerns for some participants. Dylan Matthews wrote in </span><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9124145/effective-altruism-global-ai\"><span>Vox</span></a><span> that although he agreed with its aims, he came away from the conference worried. We thought his article was well worth reading and that effective altruists need to take his criticisms seriously. A few of us* have thought about some of his points and would like to respond to some of the points made, as well as the idea that effective altruism has lost sight of its mission.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>Picking a Cause</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>\u201cIn the beginning,\u201d Matthews writes, \u201cEA was mostly about fighting global poverty. Now it's becoming more and more about funding computer science research to forestall an artificial intelligence\u2013provoked apocalypse.\u201d</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>Effective altruism has always been about challenging received wisdom and using evidence to find the best ways to make the world a better place. In part, this involves looking for the best ways to solve particular problems: Which charities working in this area are most effective? Would it be better for me to work for them directly, or to earn lots of money and donate it?</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>But that\u2019s only half of the story. The other half is working out which problems we should be focusing on. Which problems cause (or will cause) the most harm, and which can we do the most about? With limited resources, does it make more sense to focus on researching new drugs to help people living with HIV/AIDS, on educating the millions of children who still grow up unable to read, or on preventing climate change?</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>The answers to these questions are enormously important: every additional life saved means a family who doesn\u2019t lose their loved one, and a person who gets to lead the life they should be able to. But they are difficult questions, and it\u2019s no surprise that different people have come to different conclusions. Many effective altruists continue to believe that global poverty is the most pressing problem in the world: </span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\"><span>Giving What We Can</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\"><span>GiveWell</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\"><span>The Life You Can Save</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/\"><span>Charity Science</span></a><span> are all broadly focused on the developing world.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>Participants at EA Global in San Francisco would have heard, just before the panel discussion that Matthews focuses on, a featured presentation delivered by Jacqueline Fuller - who directs $100m a year on behalf of Google towards education, development, and renewable energy.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>Other effective altruists are focused on policy change or animal welfare. Matthews mentions a talk by Nick Cooney, among a number of other speakers on the subject at the conference.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>There are also some effective altruists who believe that the most pressing problems are existential risks - serious threats to human existence or prosperity. Of these, climate change is the most publicized and probably the best-researched, but it\u2019s not the only one. Risks from pandemics are also widely discussed and artificially intelligent systems pose a more novel risk.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>Concern about super-intelligent machines sounds like science fiction. It remains speculative, but huge advances have been made in AI technology in just the last few years. This does create the possibility, as Matthews explains, that at some point in the coming century there may be extremely powerful artificial systems that might pose some risk for humanity. In general, governance structures change slower than technology. So some effective altruists feel it is worth exploring how society should react to this risk now, instead of waiting for it to be urgent. Clearly, not everyone should work on this, but some think the right number of people to work on it is quite a bit above zero.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>EA is, and has always been, about finding and acting on ways to do the most good - and following that through even if it takes you places you weren\u2019t originally expecting.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>Global Poverty is Not a Rounding Error</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>So the first response to Matthews is that yes, there are some effective altruists focused on preparing for artificial intelligence well in advance. They are in the minority, but it is worth taking their arguments seriously.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>But Matthews also cautions about the language he heard used to set AI research apart from other causes, with \u201cmultiple attendees\u201d suggesting that by comparison, they say, global poverty is a \u201crounding error.\u201d</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>Dismissing the suffering of those living in poverty is not defensible. Helping people now matters, even when we also recognize the importance of preventing \u00a0future generations from suffering. People are still dying of and suffering from easily preventable conditions. Global inequality remains enormous. Access to basic things which are important to human dignity, like education and representation, is still not universal. There are many opportunities to make the world much better, very cost-effectively, and we should take them.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>Even if one cares mostly about the long-term, as </span><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\"><span>GiveWell</span></a><span> explains, helping reduce global poverty now is important. By reducing the burden of hunger or disease, we enable people to become better educated and more productive, stimulating developing economies as well as voluntary and cooperative works. The long-term effect is to reduce conflict and permanently raise the standard of living worldwide - hardly a \u201crounding error.\u201d</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>We Can Do More</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>Matthews makes some other good points. Effective altruism is diverse in many ways - it boasts members around the world, across the political spectrum, and from many social backgrounds. But there are ways this could improve, and we take it very seriously. Our organisation, the Centre for Effective Altruism, has a full-time staff member dedicated to improving inclusivity, and we are looking for other opportunities to move in the right direction.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>He also suggests that we\u2019re \u201cself-congratulatory.\u201d There\u2019s some truth to this, and we should fix that. It\u2019s important that effective altruists do take some time to reflect on what has gone well as a result of their hard work so far - both in order to learn from it and to remain motivated to work harder in future. That said, we clearly still have a long road ahead and are only a small part of a global community working to make the world a better place. We have a lot to learn.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>Effective altruism remains a big tent, united by a common commitment to making the biggest difference possible through evidence and effort. There will always be room in the movement for people working towards a wide range of causes, whether they are focused on alleviating suffering now or are worried about the future of mankind. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>----------</span></p>\n<br><span>*Michelle Hutchinson, Owen Cotton-Barratt, Becky Cotton-Barratt, Bernadette Young, Nick Beckstead, I, and some others all contributed to this piece - but it should be taken to represent the views of only Michelle and me since the others have not seen the final draft.</span></strong><p></p></div></div>"},

Of course, you can take it further than that if you\u2019d like and ask colleagues or your social network.</span></p>\n<p><span>You should </span><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/christmas-fundraisers.html\"><span>Donate Your Christmas</span></a><span> because by using the available resources with relatively small time commitments, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll raise counterfactual funds for your preferred GiveWell recommended charity. In addition, it\u2019s worth considering because it\u2019s an opportunity to potentially spread ideas relating to effective altruism. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<h1 id=\"It_s_likely_to_raise_counterfactual_funds_for_your_preferred_GiveWell_recommended_charity_\"><span>It\u2019s likely to raise counterfactual funds for your preferred GiveWell recommended charity </span></h1>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>First, I will outline why it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll raise money by briefly looking at seasonal trends, donor motivations, and results from other peer-to-peer campaigns, and then briefly state why it seems likely that part of the funds raised will be counterfactual. </span></p>\n<p><span>Much evidence suggests people are more likely to give in December. For instance,</span><span> </span><a href=\"https://aytm.com/blog/daily-survey-results/charitable-giving-survey/\"><span>one survey</span></a><span> </span><span>reported that 40% said they\u2019re more likely to give during the holiday season than would be for the rest of the year. </span><a href=\"http://www.networkforgood.com/digitalgivingindex/\"><span>Network For Good\u2019s Digital Giving Index</span></a><span> also </span><span>reports that 31% of annual giving occurred in December.</span></p>\n<p><span>In addition, evidence on donor motivations indicates that peer-to-peer fundraisers may be successful. For instance, academic</span><span> </span><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272710001866\"><span>research</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12114/full\"><span>suggests</span></a><span> </span><span>that social ties play a strong causal role in the decision to donate and increases average gift size as well. Complementary to this influence are the many people who give to those who ask.</span><span> </span><a href=\"https://aytm.com/blog/daily-survey-results/charitable-giving-survey/\"><span>One survey</span></a><span> </span><span>recorded 20% of respondents saying that they simply donate to the charities that ask them. </span></p>\n<p><span>Moreover, available data indicates that peer-to-peer fundraising pages regularly raise hundreds of dollars. One peer-to-peer fundraising platform reports that the average fundraising page </span><a href=\"http://www.classy.org/blog/infographic-anatomy-of-a-p2p-page/\"><span>raises $568</span></a><span> and this </span><a href=\"http://recharity.ca/value-peer-peer-fundraising/\"><span>blog post</span></a><span> reports Charity Water\u2019s average peer-to-peer fundraiser totals at $770. These figures match well with Charity Science\u2019s experience from last year\u2019s Christmas Fundraiser which raised an average of $750 CAD per peer-to-peer fundraising page and a median amount of $319 CAD. </span></p>\n<p><span>Unless your peer group and family regularly donate to GiveWell-recommended charities, it\u2019s reasonable to suggest that a portion of the funds raised will be counterfactual. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<h1 id=\"There_are_relatively_small_time_costs_\"><span>There are relatively small time costs</span><span> </span></h1>\n<p><span>The Christmas Fundraiser is easy to set up \u2013</span><span> </span><span>visit our Christmas fundraisers page for the </span><a href=\"http://christmas.causevox.com/\"><span>US</span></a><span>, the </span><a href=\"http://ukchristmas.causevox.com/\"><span>UK</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"http://cachristmas.causevox.com/\"><span>Canada</span></a><span> </span><span>or</span><span> </span><a href=\"http://ozchristmas.causevox.com/\"><span>Australia</span></a><span> </span><span>on the donations platform CauseVox and then click \u201cCreate a Fundraising Page.\u201d The next steps should be self-explanatory, and we\u2019ve provided default text which you may adjust and pictures too so that the time costs involved are minimal. </span></p>\n<p><span>When running your fundraiser, you can check out Peter Hurford\u2019s</span><span> </span><a href=\"/ea/cs/how_i_raised_501032_for_amf_and_how_you_can_too/\"><span>guide to running a fundraiser</span></a><span> </span><span>for an overview of techniques that could lead to a successful fundraiser.

The thing is, as I generally have way too much stuff already and I\u2019d rather gift money go towards saving lives, so I\u2019ve decided to run a birthday/Christmas fundraiser in lieu of gifts. </span></p>\n<p><span>All of the money I raise is going to give kids in the developing world medicine.

Even just $10 would help eight kids. </span><span>[Note: saying even just a small bit helps makes it so people can donate just a little and feel OK about it.

I should note that we feel uncomfortable presenting ourselves as authorities on this for a range of reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The circumstances of the people asking are often very different from our own, so we lack a lot of relevant knowledge.</li>\n<li>The circumstances of the people asking are often much more precarious, making bad advice on our part more dangerous.</li>\n<li>It feels inappropriate to tell people who are much less privileged than us what to do with their lives.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>However, as the question arises frequently, and silence is also unhelpful, I feel we have to should have at least something to say about it. Indeed I believe there are significant opportunities open to people with an effective altruist mindset in the developing world.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Here are some tentative ideas, but <em>please take them with several pinches of salt</em>:</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>As always,\u00a0<strong>develop career capital and explore:\u00a0</strong>study hard,\u00a0network, learn English, complete high school and probably a degree too, as this will open a range of additional options. Online education resources can be particularly valuable for you.</li>\n<li>Try to <strong>migrate to an OECD country</strong>, perhaps by moving for higher education. This one is straightforward and usually on people's lists anyway where possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Become a good professional in your home country</strong>. All of the traditional 'social impact' jobs that seem less valuable to residents of rich countries, such as being a <strong>good teacher</strong>, <strong>engineer</strong>,<strong> nurse </strong>or<strong> physician</strong>, look a lot more valuable in a country that has far fewer such experts per capita. In some countries teachers <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4043/WPS4847.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">only show up to work half of the time</a>, which suggests it may be straightforward to do better if you are sufficiently motivated to do so. It is common to find developing countries with only a <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.PHYS.ZS?order=wbapi_data_value_2012+wbapi_data_value&amp;sort=asc\">fifth</a> as many physicians per capita as some OECD countries, which would suggest each could have five times as much direct impact, using the 'logarithmic returns' rule of thumb.</li>\n<li>Try to get a <strong>job in an aid agency or charity working on your country</strong>\u00a0and help them be better, using your superior knowledge of local circumstances.</li>\n<li><strong>Aim to start a business</strong> that can employ people and raise labour productivity in your country. This is particularly valuable if your business can i) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_transfer\">import technologies from overseas</a> to automate tasks and make each employee more productive, ii) employ staff or serve customers in poverty, iii) grow rapidly. This is something we suggest to people in developed countries too; as a person in a developing country you have local knowledge that can give you some advantages in this work.</li>\n<li>The internet opens up opportunities for remote 'direct work' that can be similarly as valuable regardless of where in the world you are. For example, if you have the necessary quantitative or analytical skills consider training in: <strong>statistics or data science</strong>, <strong>web design</strong> and <strong>programming</strong>. These can be learnt significantly through online education. You can then 'earn to give', or do 'direct work' for a valuable organisation, such as <a href=\"https://www.sendwave.com/\">Wave</a>. Valuable skills may also assist with future migration options.</li>\n<li>Consider <strong>becoming an expert at assisting people in your country to migrate</strong> to richer countries.</li>\n<li>Enter <strong>politics, the military</strong> or the<strong> civil service</strong> in your country, with the goal of making decisions based on the greater good of the world, cost-effectiveness research, and being otherwise 'incorruptible'. Be aware that in some countries refusing to participate in corruption or sectarian politics may be dangerous to you personally, or prevent you from advancing in your career.</li>\n<li><strong>Spread important ideas within your country, or online</strong>. For example, you can translate important works on <a href=\"/ea/6w/cosmopolitanism/\">moral cosmopolitanism</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_(book)\">animal welfare</a> to your local language, or blog about them. Alternatively, learn another language such as English or Spanish and participate in discussions online - for example, anyone can promote vegetarianism through social media regardless of the country they are in. Of course, traditional ideas in effective altruism, like 'give 10%', are likely to be a much tougher sell in a lower income country.</li>\n<li>One advantage of being in a poorer country is that <strong>your living costs are much lower in terms of US dollars</strong>. Someone who is earning to give in a rich country could sponsor you to do one of the above at a much lower cost than that to support someone in the US doing the same.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>I'm interested to hear about other ideas, or why the above options are not actually sound.</div>\n</div></div></div>"},

I've experimented with a more discursive style, but it may come off as flabby, verbose, etc. Probably won't cover anything new. Hope folks enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.]</p>\n<p>When I applied to medical school, I had to write a personal statement: selling how exceptional my achievements were, what wonderful personal qualities I had, and my noble motivations for wanting to be a doctor. The last of these is the most embarrassing in retrospect:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want to study medicine because of a desire I have to help others, and so the chance of spending a career doing something worthwhile I cannot resist. Of course, Doctors [sic] don\u2019t have a monopoly on altruism, but I believe the attributes I have lend themselves best to medicine, as opposed to all the work I could do instead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These \u201cI like science and I want to help people\u201d sentiments are common in budding doctors: when I recite this bit of my personal statement in a talk (generally as a self-flagellating opening gambit) I get a mix of laughs and groans of recognition \u2013 most wrote something similar. The impression I get from those who have to\u00a0<em>read</em>\u00a0this juvenalia is the \u201cI like science and I want to help people\u201d wannabe doctor is regarded akin to a child zooming around on their bike with stabilizers \u2013 an endearing work in progress. As they became seasoned in the blood sweat and tears of clinical practice, the vainglorious naivete will transform into a more grizzled, realistic, humane compassion.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/520-the-mark-of-the-immature-man-is-that-he-wants\">Less dying nobly, more living humbly</a>; less JD, and more Perry Cox.</p>\n<p>I still have a long way to go.<a></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"A_portrait_of_the_altruist_as_a_young_man\">A portrait of the altruist as a young man</h1>\n<p>My other interest back then was philosophy, so much so that it was a toss-up whether I should try and study medicine or philosophy. Along the way I read ethics, which led to utilitarianism, which led to Singer\u2019s \u2018<a href=\"http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1972----.htm\">Famine, Affluence, and Morality</a>\u2018. I remember at the time thinking how austere and demanding it was, but after some wrestling with my conscience I decided it was the right thing to do. So at around the age of sixteen I decided I would devote my life towards making the world better: of course, that would mean giving lots of my money to charity; and of course I had to spend my life doing something important (I settled on curing AIDS as a suitably worthy goal); and so, of course, the rather painful to read personal statement above.</p>\n<p>I chose medicine, and kept philosophy around as an affectation during medical school. My altruistic zeal faded under the pressure of work. It took another philosophy book \u2013\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Living-High-Letting-Die-Innocence/dp/0195108590\">Living High and Letting Die</a>\u00a0(ironically bought at a charity shop) \u2013 to prod these thoughts back into the front of my mind.</p>\n<p>The moral case made by Singer and Unger (and many others) has a simple summary. Very large numbers of people are suffering and dying from so-called \u2018diseases of poverty\u2019 \u2013 diseases that would be cured, or prevented, or ameliorated if only those afflicted could afford to. If you are rich \u2013 which, relative to those suffering from diseases of poverty, virtually everyone reading this\u00a0<em>will\u00a0</em>be \u2013 you\u00a0<em>can</em>afford to. So you\u00a0could give some of your money to help these people: you would still be very well off, and you\u2019d make some of them a lot better. Why not?</p>\n<p>Some soft numbers make the consequentialist case harder to resist. Although it is hard to estimate (on which more later) it is conservatively reckoned a few thousand pounds, given well, could save a child\u2019s life. It seems hard to pretend that\u00a0<em>anyone\u2019s\u00a0</em>few grand is worth more than a child\u2019s life: if we could choose between depriving Richard the rich person of a few thousand pounds worth of stuff (a couple of nice holidays, say) or depriving Pauline the pauper of her 2 year old child, the choice that should be made is obvious. Nothing morally relevant changes when the few thousand pounds are not Richard\u2019s but our own. Giving lots of our money away is thus a moral bargain, and few of us are taking advantage of it as much as we should.</p>\n<p>You needn\u2019t be a thoroughgoing consequentialist to accept this sort of reasoning. Singer et al. strive to show assent to much weaker moral principles (e.g. \u201cIf you can secure a really great good for someone else via a much smaller sacrifice on your part, you ought to make this sacrifice\u201d) are enough to drive a much greater concern for charity. Besides, other ways of thinking converge here: perhaps one should give lots because it begins to\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2014-12-02/christianity-and-giving\">live up to Jesus\u2019s commandment to love your neighbour as yourself</a>\u00a0\u2013 I understand most world religions are similarly keen on charity; or perhaps one should give lots because what made us rich and made them poor is unjust, and giving goes part way to correcting this inequity \u2013 perhaps it should even be viewed as reparations for prior colonial injustices; or perhaps something else.</p>\n<p>In any case, I renewed my faith in the \u2018giving lots\u2019 principle of charity. It was around this time I first heard of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a>\u00a0\u2013 a group of people who were pledging to give 10% of their income to help beat global poverty. At the time I ignored them, because I thought (with the easy self-assured righteousness of someone living on their parents\u2019 forbearance and government-subsidized credit) that 10%\u00a0<em>wasn\u2019t enough</em>, and I was obviously going to give much more than that when I started earning \u2013 conveniently a long time away.</p>\n<p>It took me a few more years to realize that Giving What We Can was for people planning to give 10%\u00a0<em>or more</em>\u00a0(and indeed the guy who set it up\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11950843\">was doing just that</a>), and there might be benefits to joining a community of such people, and trying to encourage others to do what I was planning to. So I joined up in 2012 or so, generally made a nuisance of myself both in my local university group and the wider organization, and looked forward to completing medical school and having a salary to start practicing\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/comment/0013318-why-im-giving-10-of-my-income-to-charity.html\">what I had been preaching interminably</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"My_Giving\">My Giving</h1>\n<p>N.B: This section is going to talk about how much I have given to charity. This violates norms about it being bad, or immodest, or self-aggrandizing to talk about ones charitable giving:\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_6:3\">Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth</a>, etc.\u00a0My intent in doing so is to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.tcs.cam.ac.uk/?p=0025508\">encourage more charitable giving</a>, to normalize bolder efforts at charity \u2013 and, besides, I don\u2019t take what I am doing to be particularly praiseworthy. If you\u2019re unsatisfied at this defense, accept my apology, and feel free to scroll through.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m writing this after around 18 months of being a doctor, and thus 18 months of earning a salary.</p>\n<p>Last academic year (Aug \u201913 to Jul \u201914) I earned \u00a333,214 and gave \u00a310,836, about a third of my (pre-tax) income. I put a spreadsheet of my giving\u00a0<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gVx43MTO2yvMNukL2WUp7LOORlIVMcf6SCDcIpX4feQ/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>: I didn\u2019t give anything at first as I wanted to buy various bits and pieces for my medical career, but steadily ramped up my giving as I found I could afford to give quite a lot \u2013 in the last few months I was giving just over half my money away. Although I do not have such good figures for the first six months of the current academic year thanks to various administrivia, I intend to stick with\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/giving-half\">giving around half</a>, and will be giving several thousand pounds of my (now slightly larger) salary towards this end.</p>\n<p>What am I giving to, exactly? When I joined Giving What We Can, I found out that giving smart was as important as giving lots. My naive assumption was that there wasn\u2019t much to choose between different interventions: Tuberculosis, Malaria, HIV, starvation (and many more) are all awful things, so it made little difference which particular horror one\u2019s money was directed against. The data proved me wrong: different interventions tackling\u00a0<em>the same disease</em>\u00a0can\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/research/charities-area/hivaids\">vary in efficacy by\u00a0<em>orders of magnitude</em></a>, and so there are vast dividends to finding the most effective interventions, and the most effective charities. Happily, both Giving What We Can and another group called\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">Givewell</a>\u00a0tackle this very hard question, and reassuringly their recommendations\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/top-charities\">align</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">closely</a>. So about half of my money goes into a charitable trust run by Giving What We Can, which in turn distributes it to these extremely high performing charities.\u00a0<a title=\"For those interested in how this is distributed via the trust: you can instruct the trust to give to charities it includes in whatever proportions you see fit.\u00a0I have stipulated the trust distributes my money in proportion to the other charities the trust dispenses funds to \u2013 so if half the money given via the trust goes to the Against Malaria Foundation and the other half to Deworm the World, then my donation is split 50:50 between the two (and mutatis mutandis\u00a0to whatever the actual balance of contributions actually are). The underlying idea is to exploit peer knowledge. Although one can identify what look like very high performing charities, picking between these for the very highest \u2018value for money\u2019 is hard, on which sensible people disagree. I don\u2019t back myself to have a better insight than they, but I can apply an \u2018equal-weight\u2019 type view and so try and follow the weighted sum of sensible opinion, which should be closer to the mark than my own guessing. The closest financial analogy would be an index fund.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/saving-the-world-and-healing-the-sick/#note-9-1\"><sup>1</sup></a></p>\n<p>The other half is directed to more \u2018behind the scenes\u2019 work. Answering the \u2018what does the most good?\u2019 question is extremely hard, and rides on top of several other extremely hard questions, yet getting better answers\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2012-10-27/estimating-the-effectiveness-of-dcp2\">could be extremely valuable</a>. So last year the other half was given to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/research/global-priorities-project/\">funding research into these questions</a>.\u00a0I plan to do the same sort of thing this year: half of my giving towards effective charities, and the other half aimed at \u2018behind the scenes\u2019 work, in the hope this will lead to even better outcomes (and more donations!) further down the road.\u00a0<a title=\"Another possibility, given how helpful I have found this way of thinking about things for myself, is the fund efforts to spread the word more widely. I\u2019m not sure yet.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/saving-the-world-and-healing-the-sick/#note-9-2\"><sup>2</sup></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"I_m_no_Superman\">I\u2019m no Superman</h1>\n<p>N.B. This section is going to talk (among other things) about how wealthy I am. Similar to above, I know doing so is unseemly, but I think the ends justify the means. Again, apologies if I am wrong, and feel free to skip.</p>\n<p>When people find out how much I\u2019m giving, they tend to react with either admiration (one Buddhist FY1 I know said it was \u2018amazing\u2019, and that it would earn me great merit for my next life \u2013 here\u2019s hoping!); consternation (in the words of one medical registrar: \u201cIt really upsets me how much you\u2019re giving. Promise me you\u2019ll stop.\u201d);\u00a0or, perhaps most commonly, cynicism (\u201cYou\u2019ll change your tune when you get a mortgage/have kids/you have to deal with your wife\u2019s shoe budget etc.\u201d). I don\u2019t think any of these attitudes are quite right.</p>\n<p>I am giving a larger proportion than the average household in the UK (around 0.5% of gross income)<a title=\"I couldn\u2019t find a direct source of this, so I had to calculate it myself, which is more error prone. The average weekly donation per household (in 2008) was \u00a32.42, giving a yearly donation of \u00a0\u00a3126.27.

Medical salaries increase with seniority, so, even if I continue giving half, my position in the global pecking order will improve still further. So even\u00a0<em>after</em>\u00a0my giving, I am still earning more than the average \u2018man on the street\u2019 where I live, and\u00a0<em>many, many times</em>\u00a0more than the average person alive today.</p>\n<p>This partly explains why I don\u2019t feel poorly off or destitute. There are other parts. One is that\u00a0<a href=\"https://prezi.com/_azcgt_nucbe/giving-and-happiness-final/\">giving generally makes you happier</a>, and often more happier than buying things for yourself. Another is that I am fortunate in non-monetary respects: my biggest medical problem is dandruff, I have a loving family, a wide and interesting circle of friends, a fulfilling job, an e-reader which I can use to store (and occasionally read) the finest works of western literature, an internet connection I should use for better things than loitering on social media, and so on, and so on, and so on. I am blessed beyond all measure of desert.</p>\n<p>So I don\u2019t think that my giving has made me \u2018worse off\u2019. If you put a gun to my head and said, \u201cHere\u2019s the money you gave away back. You\u00a0<em>must</em>\u00a0spend it solely to further your own happiness\u201d, I probably wouldn\u2019t give it away: I guess a mix of holidays, savings, books, music and trips to the theatre might make me even happier (but who knows? people are bad at affective forecasting). But I\u2019m pretty confident giving has made me happier compared to the case where I never had the money in the first place. So the downside looks like, \u201cBy giving, I have made myself even happier from an already very happy baseline, but foregone opportunities to give myself a larger happiness increment still\u201d. This seems a trivial downside at worst, and not worth mentioning across the scales from the upside, which might be several lives saved, or a larger number of lives improved and horrible diseases prevented.</p>\n<p>I agree with the cynics that these sorts of \u2018sacrifices\u2019 are pretty easy when you are as unjustly privileged as I am. And of course my circumstances might change: maybe my good run is interrupted by some misfortune, or (as I hope is more likely) maybe \u2018life gets in the way\u2019 \u2013 marriage, kids, and middle England might come knocking. If things change, then they change \u2013 although I hope in the latter case I could follow examples of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/dec/24/toby-ord-bernadette-young-joy-of-giving\">Toby Ord and Bernadette Young</a>, or\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/\">Julia Wise</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/giving\">Jeff Kaufmann</a>\u00a0in terms of combining a family with charitable giving.

You generally don\u2019t save lives, especially if you\u2019re junior, because there\u2019s a long hierarchy of supervising doctors who are poised to leap in and save the day in case you don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>In 18 months of being a doctor, I can point to one instance where I maybe \u2013\u00a0<em>maybe</em>\u00a0\u2013 saved someone\u2019s life. She was 92, on a respiratory ward for pneumonia, and had suddenly become breathless on a background of on-again, off-again chest pain. She was compromised, her chest sounded wet, and the X-ray showed fluid on the lungs, and the bloods later demonstrated a heart attack. I was on call, and the medical registrar (generally the guardian angel of the hospital wards, especially when you\u2019re a shit-scared first year) was with an even sicker patient. I sprung into action: oxygen, morphine, GTN, CPAP, relatives, forlorn call to ITU to confirm that ward-based treatment was the ceiling of care \u2013 in other words, if this didn\u2019t work, they wouldn\u2019t take her, and she would die.</p>\n<p>Happily, it worked, and she got better in the next couple of hours, and went home well a while later. Could I really say I saved her life? At the very least I have to share credit with the nurses and assistants who readied all the kit and administered all the drugs I\u2019d prescribed, not to mention being astute enough to see she was really unwell and demanding the doctor come quickly. Credit diffuses further if we include (and we should) all the people who were needed for her to recover and leave hospital: her usual team of doctors, and the specialists who reviewed her, several teams of nursing staff on two different wards, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, pharmacists, and many more. Besides, maybe all my panicked doctoring was coincidental to her getting better by herself; and even if the doctoring was vital, maybe another doctor could have stepped into the breach in time had I not been able to do it myself.</p>\n<p>So the total \u2018QALY yield\u2019 for my \u2018life saving\u2019 was not that high, especially when we add in that at 92 this lady\u2019s expected lifespan is fairly short even if she returns to good health. Of course, I did other things in the last 18 months: I could brag about (in ascending order of frequency) some atypically astute diagnoses, performing some tricky practical procedures, prescribing analgesia, and marshalling paper work as some other \u2018QALY positive\u2019 things to add to the sum total of my good deeds.\u00a0In sum, thought, it probably isn\u2019t that much \u2013 as all the caveats to my \u2018saving a life\u2019 apply here.</p>\n<p>Besides, the life-saving isn\u2019t the thing I am most proud of in my nascent medical career. It\u2019s this:</p>\n<p>My first rotation was on a general medical ward. One of the patients was mid eighties admitted after a fall. He had a long list of co-morbidities, amongst them vascular dementia. Medically, he was making an unremarkable recovery, but he was upset and morose: as he kept saying, he had been with his wife for 60 years, and was lost without her. Each bed (including his) had a phone which could be used with cards bought in the corridor outside, and the ward phone was only five meters from his bed. Both were several steps too far for his severely impaired cognition: he had a digit span of 3 at best, did not remember how to operate a phone, and had a shaky grasp of where he was and why his wife wasn\u2019t there.</p>\n<p>It took a couple of days for me to realize I could help him out. I promised I would help him talk to his wife, but I forgot him\u00a0amongst the other patients. The day after he told me again how how lonely he was, how much he wanted to be with his wife, how they had been married for sixty years\u2026 he had forgotten my promise, but it reminded me.</p>\n<p>Stung by my failing, I got to work. I checked with the ward clerk that the patient\u2019s phones could receive calls (they could). I noted his number down from his bedside. I found his wife\u2019s number from his medical notes, and phoned her. She was also frail (although faculties intact) and recovering from her\u00a0<em>own</em>\u00a0fall at their home, and so could not easily visit, although she hoped to as soon as she was able. I gave her his number, and suggested she call it now. I loitered by his bed for a couple of minutes until the phone rang, and I handed it to him. He thanked me tearfully the day after.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Chequebooks_and_stethoscopes\">Chequebooks and stethoscopes</h1>\n<p>Anecdotes make unreliable data\u00a0<a title=\"Aside: Although they are data, thus the adage \u201cThe plural of anecdote is not data\u201d, is \u2013 sensu stricto \u2013 false.

His strategy was looking at trial data to look at the impact of the most common medical interventions, and then extrapolating them to the population. Medicine turns out pretty well \u2013 it can take credit for a few of the many years added to life expectancy in the developed world since the turn of the last century. Playing with some numbers, you can get a fairly good-sounding estimate of the impact of a doctor like me over their career: ~2500 QALYs.\u00a0<a title=\"QALY \u2013 Quality-adjusted life year, a subset of health adjusted life years. The idea is to produce a unified metric of health that can be used to compare diseases (and their treatments) to one another.

The \u2018Quality adjustment\u2019 is harder: one tries to come up with \u2018weights\u2019 for given disabilities to see how much worse they are to live with than perfect health (so if blindness was weighed at 0.5, then 2 years of blindness are about as good as one year of healthy life).

It is also obvious that doctors can\u2019t take sole credit for medicine (what about nurses, pharmacists, porters, and, well, everyone else?); that the relationship between doctors and health is confounded (what about better education, wealth, hygiene, and the other\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_determinants_of_health\">social determinants of health</a>?); that doctors should have diminishing marginal turns, and be\u00a0<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2014/07/what-does-economics-tell-us-about-replaceability/\">replaceable</a>\u00a0\u2013 if I was never a doctor, there would not be a \u2018Greg shaped hole\u2019 in the national health service.</p>\n<p>A better analysis would try and correct for confounders, try and account for diminishing returns, and maybe look at macro measures of health disease and their relationships to doctor numbers. I couldn\u2019t find that, so I\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save/\">tried</a>\u00a0to do it\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/why-doctors-dont-do-much-good/\">myself</a>. The bottom line is bad news for medics (but perhaps better news for everyone else!) The \u2018QALY impact\u2019 of a medical career is not ~2500 QALYs, but maybe ~150, and as the data and methods improve, the numbers get smaller still (I hope it never goes negative\u2026) Rather than saving lives every episode, one is adding a few years of life every year.</p>\n<p>The comparison to charity is humbling. The \u2018cost per QALY\u2019 of a leading charity (such as the Against Malaria Foundation) may lie around ~\u00a360/QALY. So the good of my medical career is approximately the same as \u00a39000, given well.\u00a0<em>Pro rata</em>, it means a year is worth around \u00a3240, each working day just over \u00a31.

Bitzer, yours.\u2019 The square finger, moving here and there, lighted suddenly on Bitzer, perhaps because he chanced to sit in the same ray of sunlight which, darting in at one of the bare windows of the intensely whitewashed room, irradiated Sissy. For, the boys and girls sat on face of the inclined plane in two compact bodies, divided up the centre by a narrow interval; and Sissy, being at the corner of a row on the other side, came in for the beginning of a sunbeam, of which Bitzer, being at the comer of a row on the other side, a few rows in advance, caught the end. But, whereas the girl was dark-eyed and dark-haired, that she seemed to receive a deeper and more lustrous colour from the sun when it shone upon her, the boy was so light-eyed and light-haired that the self-same rays appeared to draw out of him what little colour he ever possessed. His cold eyes would hardly have been eyes, but for the short ends of lashes which, by bringing them into immediate contrast with something paler than themselves, expressed their form. His shortcropped hair might have been a mere continuation of the sandy freckles on his forehead and face. His skin was so unwholesomely deficient in the natural tinge, that he looked as though, if he were cut, he would bleed white. \u2018Bitzer,\u2019 said Thomas Gradgrind. \u2018Your definition of a horse.\u2019 \u2018Quadruped. Graminivorous. Forty teeth, namely twenty-four grinders, four eye-teeth, and twelve incisive. Sheds coat in the spring; in marshy countries, sheds hoofs, too. Hoofs hard, but requiring to be shod with iron. Age known by marks in mouth.\u2019 Thus (and much more) Bitzer. \u2018Now girl number twenty,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018You know what a horse is.\u2019 QALYs are imperfect, but they do count, and although a QALY measure of the good my medical career does fails to capture all of its value, it will similarly fail to capture the goods of high performing charity. Every death of a child from malaria has its own tragic story \u2013 stories which we all too seldom hear. We err badly if we attend to how vivid\u00a0goods and evils are to our imagination, rather than to their size; first responders to multiple casualty incident are told to\u00a0ignore those who are screaming\u00a0at first, but to look carefully for any people who are so desperately injured they cannot even cry for help. And if a common failing of doctors is to become drunk on their apostolic role and self-righteous power, looking at \u2018just the bare numbers\u2019, sobering as they are, may part-way provide a cure.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/saving-the-world-and-healing-the-sick/#note-9-9\"><sup>9</sup></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"On_saving_the_world\">On saving the world</h1>\n<p>The seventeen year old who wanted to be a doctor should be disappointed: medicine has a modest impact on people living long and being healthy, and although an individual doctor may be the mechanism through which this modest impact flows, little of it depended on you.</p>\n<p>But doctor\u2019s don\u2019t have a monopoly on altruism, and the seventeen year old me who wanted to save the world would be overjoyed. The difference a doctor makes is significant, even if it is small in QALY terms; charity can make a large difference in QALY terms, and its \u2018real\u2019 value is larger still. I have not lost out, and only benefited from thinking carefully and trying my best to make a difference \u2013 hopefully (and expectedly) many others have benefited too.

The underlying idea is to exploit peer knowledge. Although one can identify what look like very high performing charities, picking between these for the very highest \u2018value for money\u2019 is hard, on which sensible people disagree.

But, whereas the girl was dark-eyed and dark-haired, that she seemed to receive a deeper and more lustrous colour from the sun when it shone upon her, the boy was so light-eyed and light-haired that the self-same rays appeared to draw out of him what little colour he ever possessed. His cold eyes would hardly have been eyes, but for the short ends of lashes which, by bringing them into immediate contrast with something paler than themselves, expressed their form. His shortcropped hair might have been a mere continuation of the sandy freckles on his forehead and face. His skin was so unwholesomely deficient in the natural tinge, that he looked as though, if he were cut, he would bleed white.</p>\n<p>\u2018Bitzer,\u2019 said Thomas Gradgrind. \u2018Your definition of a horse.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Quadruped. Graminivorous. Forty teeth, namely twenty-four grinders, four eye-teeth, and twelve incisive. Sheds coat in the spring; in marshy countries, sheds hoofs, too. Hoofs hard, but requiring to be shod with iron. Age known by marks in mouth.\u2019 Thus (and much more) Bitzer.</p>\n<p>\u2018Now girl number twenty,\u2019 said Mr. Gradgrind. \u2018You know what a horse is.\u2019</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>QALYs are imperfect, but they do count, and although a QALY measure of the good my medical career does fails to capture all of its value, it will similarly fail to capture the goods of high performing charity. Every death of a child from malaria has its own tragic story \u2013 stories which we all too seldom hear. We err badly if we attend to how\u00a0<em>vivid</em>\u00a0goods and evils are to our imagination, rather than to their size; first responders to multiple casualty incident are told to\u00a0<em>ignore\u00a0</em>those who are screaming\u00a0at first, but to look carefully for any people who are so desperately injured they cannot even cry for help. And if a common failing of doctors is to become drunk on their apostolic role and self-righteous power, looking at \u2018just the bare numbers\u2019, sobering as they are, may part-way provide a cure.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/saving-the-world-and-healing-the-sick/#return-note-9-9\">\u21a9</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div></div>"},

The best way of influencing those around you is when they can see that you are donating time and money to a cause you believe in passionately \u2013 and that doing so is making the world a better place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Provide_a_personal_story\">Provide a personal story</h2>\n<p>If you can tie in your own personal story of exploration of these ideas into the narrative. How did you come across EA ideas? What inspired you? What things do you do? What changed you? Etc.</p>\n<p>If you cannot provide your own story a story of a friend will work too. Eg: \u201cmy friend K was really nervous about giving 10% but then . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Show_people_how_being_EA_can_help_them_achieve_their_own_goals\">Show people how being EA can help them achieve their own goals</h2>\n<p>For example many people want to make the world better. The EA community can help them better achieve this goal. It can also help with many other common goals: provide friends / meaning / volunteering opportunities / happiness / a sense of superiority ;-p / etc. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Do_not_let_people_be_on_the_defensive\">Do not let people be on the defensive</h2>\n<p>Agree with the person you are talking to as much as you honestly can. If they express a belief agree it is a valid belief and then work within that framework. Eg: \u201cyes that makes sense as a reason to prioritise our community first, but for me personally when I realise how much good even tiny amount of donations to the developing world can . . . .\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Do not say \u201cno you are wrong\u201d unless it is a very clear factual inaccuracy where you are sure you have strong evidence that will make them update their views. Even then try to soften it with a phrase like \u201cthat is a common myth actually there is current consensus is . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>It can be useful to begin introducing EA with a really basic uncontroversial definition that no one can reasonably disagree with, something like: \"<em>Effective Altruism is applying evidence, reason and rationality to the goal of making the world a better place.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Customise\">Customise</h2>\n<p>How exactly we should present stuff needs to be decided on a case by case basis. Stop and think: 'here is a new person, how best to present EA ideas to them, what do I know about them'.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Do_not_be_moralising\">Do not be moralising</h2>\n<p>Ideally try to avoid telling people that they are obliged to do any particular action. Especially try not to tell people that what they are currently doing is bad.</p>\n<p>More generally you should shy away from subjective claims where you are unsure if the other person will agree with you. Such as \u201cx is immoral\u201d or \u201crap is the best music\u201d etc.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Be_confident_and_be_a_good_speaker\">Be confident and be a good speaker</h2>\n<p>All the tips here are focused on talking about EA to people. Being a good communicator in general would also help. Perhaps go do some general research into how to be a good speaker.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2><br></h2></div></div>"},

Once upon a  time virtually everyone lived in grinding poverty; now, thanks to the  forces of science, capitalism and total factor productivity, we produce  enough to support a much larger population at a much higher standard of  living.</p>\n<p>EAs being a highly intellectual lot, our preferred form of ritual  celebration is charts.

What is so  great about reducing the share? We could achieve that by killing all the  poor people, but <em>that </em> would not be a good thing! Life is good, and <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/poor-folks-do-smile.html\"><span>poverty is not death</span></a>; it is simply better for it to be rich.</p>\n<p>As such, I think this is a much better chart. Here we show the world  population. Those in extreme poverty are in purple \u2013 not red, for their  existence is not bad. Those who the wheels of progress have lifted into  wealth unbeknownst to our ancestors, on the other hand, are depicted in  blue, rising triumphantly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/triumph-of-humanity2.png\"><img src=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/triumph-of-humanity2.png?w=537&amp;h=322\" alt=\"Triumph of Humanity2\"></a></p>\n<p>Long may their rise continue.</p></div></div>"},

You can run an auction where if people pay a certain amount you'll follow through on different dares. You can run also run a social event like a bad dancing contest or anything that trades a bit of personal awkwardness for money towards fighting poverty.</li>\n<li><strong><img src=\"https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/windows-8-metro-style/32/outline_star.png\" alt=\"Star\">\u00a0Anything else you want to do</strong>\u00a0- Basically any reason you can think of to fundraise is a great reason to raise money for effective charities.

{"date": "13th Jul 2015", "title": "Should EAs influence corporate giving?", "author": "tyleralterman", "num_comments": "12 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>EDIT: As commenters below point out, my post was poorly named! The question my post actually addresses is something closer to \"Should we spread the brand and philosophy of the EA movement to corporate giving?\" (To which my answer is \"not yet.\") There is a separate question, which is, \"Should we make corporate giving more effective?\" that I do not tackle. (The answer to this question is probably, \"Yes, as long as we err on the side of caution in our use of the EA brand. The Giving What We Can, The Life You Can Save, and the GiveWell sub-brands might be more appropriate here.\")</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Some time ago, I set off on a plan to use this year's <a href=\"http://eaglobal.org\">EA Global</a> to improve corporate giving. This plan included the sketch of a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/150ygMKZxornW7DPx3lJ4IMhTkp6jcjfb-t7MpuY3-x4/edit?usp=sharing\">corporate engagement model</a>\u00a0aimed at steering billions of dollars to the best bets for saving and improving lives. The thought was that we'd get a half-dozen high-level people in corporate giving to publicly support this model.</p>\n<p>I now think this plan was not well-considered, and have since put it on pause. Here's why.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are a number of reasons why the EA movement should be careful about large-scale attempts to influence giving in general, and corporate giving in particular at this early stage of the movement. The first two reasons detail why instituting truly EA giving policies may be intractable at this point in the movement's development. The last reason details why it might be net negative to influence large-scale corporate giving at present.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1__EA_conclusions_are_idiosyncratic\">1. EA conclusions are idiosyncratic</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/ea/9s/effective_altruism_is_a_question_not_an_ideology/\">As Helen Toner put it best</a>, EA is principally about asking the question, \"How can I do the most good?\" (Or, less controversially, but somewhat less accurately, \"How can I save and improve the most lives?\") This question regularly yields answers that likely feel too weird for the public at present, such as \"Support meta-charity\" or \"Prevent existential risks.\"</p>\n<p>Since much of corporate giving is understandably tied to PR, I suspect that many corporate philanthropists will feel constrained in their ability to sync their giving policies with off-beat giving opportunities, even if they believe that those opportunities are the best ones.</p>\n<p>Three caveats to this conclusion:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The public's sense of what's weird can change quite rapidly. (See, e.g., gay rights.) In the future, if EA is successful as it currently seems on track to be, many EA conclusions may lose their stigma. In fact, it may become the case that <em>not</em> having an EA-based giving policy is a PR problem for many companies.</li>\n<li>There are some companies for which seeming innovative at the cost of controversy might be the right tradeoff. For example, let's say SpaceX wants to attract visionary employees who have critical thinking abilities. It might make sense for SpaceX to support more unusual EA conclusions in its public giving policy.</li>\n<li>If GiveWell/<a href=\"http://openphilanthropy.org\">Open Philanthropy Project</a> increase dramatically in status over the next few years, it might become permissable for a company to outsource its corporate giving policy to these initiatives. Outsourcing giving policies to another org might give companies a PR shield, since the giving decisions become one step removed. For instance, it would be hard to imagine a company publicly backing a charity which creates more pleasurable condoms to encourage birth control in developing countries. However, you can imagine a company contributing their funds to the Gates Foundation, even if the Gates Foundation decides to fund a few controversial initiatives (such as the condoms one).</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"2__Prioritization_itself_is_controversial\">2. Prioritization itself is controversial</h2>\n<p>The question, \"How can I save and improve the most lives?\" practically entails the assumption that there are some ways of saving/improving lives are better than others. From there, you get the importance of cause prioritization. This is still a controversial idea. E.g., a company might get flack for matching GiveWell/Open Phil-recommended donation while declining to match donations to unsupported nonprofits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3__EA_is_still_young_and_fragile\">3. EA is still young and fragile</h2>\n<p>If we think global coordination on the world's best do-gooding opportunities is important, then we better do a good job of protecting some of the best things about the EA movement.</p>\n<p>EA is currently one of the best bets out there for creating global coordination. This is because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>EAs approximately agree on ethics. E.g., that we should focus on saving/improving lives rather than on maximizing other things as ends-in-themselves. (For example: I'd guess 99% of EAs would agree that they don't support maximizing something like, \"cultural richness\" if specific ways of maximizing that richness don't significantly improve lives.)\u00a0</li>\n<li>EAs approximately agree on methodology (incl. standards of reason and evidence) when answering the question, \"How can I save/improve the most lives.\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This approximate agreement on values and methodology makes it possible for the words \"effective altruism\" to entail something quite substantive. It also enables EAs to coordinate even across dramatically different cause areas.</p>\n<p>However, given that the EA movement is still at an early stage, it is still possible for the words \"effective altruism\" to be co-opted and lose their current substance. My sense is that the ethical and intellectual core of EA needs much greater fortification before EA should be spread too widely, including via corporate giving reform. (At EA Outreach, we've become fond of saying that we're currently in the \"movement-development\" business, rather than in the \"movement-building\" one.)</p>\n<p>For instance, it would be a really bad scenario if Twitter announced that they are adopting an EA-based giving policy if that giving policy lacked pieces like cause-prioritzation or focused too much the public's attention on a narrow definition of EA (e.g. that EA is <em>only</em> about charitable giving). Twitter has a bigger megaphone than we do, and can probably influence the meaning of the words \"effective altruism\" to a greater degree than we can.</p>\n<p>If you weaken the ethical and intellectual core of EA, you run the risk of undermining the community's ability to reach consensus on the best world-improvement opportunities, and then coordinate resources toward those opportunities.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All that said, I still think people should take on the mission of improving corporate giving. However, they should practice the utmost care while doing so!</p>\n<p>Thoughts? Questions? Rebuttals?\u00a0</p></div></div>"},

(We have settled on valuing the pledge at $20,000USD to accommodate counterfactual giving and possible attrition rates. \u00a0This is a very conservative figure, as the median earning individual in the US will give away over $150,000USD \u00a0over the course of their career through the pledge. \u00a0That said, valuing the pledge quite conservatively at $20,000USD only helps to strengthen the conclusions of this post- if anything we might expect the real value of money moved to the most effective charities to be much higher than the numbers considered here) \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Even if we assume that running a chapter is quite time intensive, requiring say 40 hours a month, this means that you will still be producing 120-200 dollars of value per hour of work- an incredible result! \u00a0\u00a0The most successful chapters do much better than this. During Cambridge\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Society/article1503068.ece\">exceptionally successful event</a> this December, over </span><span>100</span><span> individuals, took the pledge representing over </span><span>$</span><span>2 million USD </span><span>going to cost-effective charities. \u00a0This is an absolutely amazing result for students to be able to have, and it really shows the potential of chapters. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span><strong>If you are an EA, I argue that one of the most impactful things you can do with your time is to start a chapter.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>If we turn our attention from University chapters, to community chapters, the same incredible returns still seem to apply. Most community chapters focus their time on social events. \u00a0Recently, Sam Hilton, head of the London chapter, <a href=\"/ea/ey/how_i_run_a_growing_effective_altruism_group_in_a/\">explained that he runs their successful chapter on only 30 minutes a month</a>, which is quite an achievement! \u00a0But even if we assume that organising a community chapter will take much more time than this, it turns out to be an incredibly valuable activity. If over the course of a year your social events lead to just one person in the group taking the pledge, that represents $20,000 USD for the most cost effective charities. \u00a0Lets say it takes 15 hours a month to organise these activities (30x more time than Sam\u2019s figure). That is 180 hours of work over the course of the year producing $20,000 USD. That means you earn roughly 110 dollars/hour for the most effective charities. \u00a0Just to put that in perspective, this represents the same value added, per hour, as someone earning $440,000 USD a year pursuing earning to give at 50% of their income. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Sufficed to say this is an incredible fact. \u00a0It clearly paints a picture of how unbelievably effective working on EA Movement growth is, insofar as this movement growth translates into people taking the pledge. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Start a chapter today!</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>I hope this post has inspired you to start a chapter at your city or at your university! \u00a0As I mentioned, by starting a chapter at your university or in your city, you could potentially move tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to the most effective charities. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>In my next post, I will be addressing some of the concerns that often prevent people from starting up a chapter. \u00a0One concern people often express is that they don't know how to properly start up a chapter, and feel intimated by the potential difficulty of it. \u00a0Luckily, Giving What We Can has shifted our outreach strategy, in part, to try and address this concern. Our outreach strategy will now be much more Chapter focused, I will be spending most of my time communicating with current chapters, and supporting people starting out new chapters. </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>If you are interested in starting a chapter, please <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.courtney@givingwhatwecan.org\">email me</a> and/or fill out <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1czOhTygsmprIaMN0CLS7jd5NVuTMlWmo8PbHnrf9I4E/viewform?usp=send_form\">this form</a>. I will be happy to work with you- sharing best practices, directing you to other EAs in your area, and otherwise doing all that I can to help make your chapter a success! </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>2015 is going to be a big year for EA- let\u2019s make it even bigger by pursuing big wins like starting up successful chapters! </span></p></div></div>"},

If your audience won\u2019t notice a flaw, your friendly local critics have little incentive to point it out. If your audience cared about flaws in your arguments, they\u2019d prefer to hear you in a context where they can expect to hear motivated capable outside critics point out flaws</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>If you are the one presenting arguments, and if you didn\u2019t try to ensure available critics, then others can reasonably conclude that you don\u2019t care much about persuading your audience that your argument lacks hidden flaws.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This raises the question: who are the best critics of effective altruism?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/ea-critique\">Ben Kuhn</a>\u00a0has given some criticism but he's an insider. (Since countered <a href=\"http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2013/12/22/pretend-to-really-really-try/\">by Katja</a>.) <a href=\"/user/Geuss/\">Geuss</a>\u00a0has written some <a href=\"/ea/d6/problems_and_solutions_in_infinite_ethics/23t\">helpful criticism</a>\u00a0but he's also involved with effective giving. <a href=\"/r/main/ea/d2/the_perspectives_on_effective_altruism_we_dont/227\">Giles</a>\u00a0has passed on some thoughts from a friend. These critics have been heroic but they are few in number. It figures, as most of us aren't incentived to say bad things about a movement with which we affiliate, and if we were forced to, we might still pull some punches.</p>\n<p>So what about outsiders? Well, 80,000 Hours have received <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?_r=0\">some criticism</a> on earning to give. They also debated some\u00a0<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/cxj/debate_between_80000_hours_and_a_socialist/\">socialists</a>. But these discussions were brief and narrowly focussed clashes between entrenched political ideologies. Others have targeted us for criticism that was so vitriolic that it was hard to find the constructive parts, such as <a href=\"http://www.philanthropydaily.com/the-coming-showdown-between-philanthrolocalism-and-effective-altruism\">William Schambra</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/the_elitist_philanthropy_of_so_called_effective_altruism\">Ken Berger and Robert Penna</a>\u00a0and the always sarcastic\u00a0<a href=\"http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Effective_altruism\">RationalWiki</a>. <em>Edit: also some criticism by <a href=\"http://www.philanthropydaily.com/earnest-but-inhumane/\">Scott Walter</a>.</em></p>\n<p>So several years into our movement, that's all we have to show for criticism. A few insiders and a few fanatics? It's not to say we can't harvest some insights from there - by god we should try. But one would hope we have more.</p>\n<p>If we cast the net wider, Warren's son <a href=\"http://qz.com/201778/warren-buffetts-son-philanthropy-disguises-itself-as-a-fix-when-its-a-part-of-the-problem/\">Peter Buffett</a>\u00a0has debated William MacAskill on the effectiveness of charity, which is kind-of cool. There are more general aid critics:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/04/02/william-easterly/why-doesnt-aid-work\">William Easterly</a>, who is a fairly thoughtful economist and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dead-Aid-working-another-Africa/dp/0141031182%5D\">Dambisa Moyo</a>, who I know less about. But these they don't really get to the heart of what we care about - if most aid is ineffective, then it would just be important to research it even harder.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, we can look at more narrowly focused critics. LessWrong is often mentioned as a useful source for criticism, and it has usefully challenged philosophical positions held by some effective altruists. Its founder, Eliezer Yudkowsky has challenged hedonistic utilitarianism and some forms of moral realism in the\u00a0<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence/\">Fun</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/y0/31_laws_of_fun/\">Theory</a>\u00a0sequence, the enigmatic (or merely misunderstood) <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Metaethics_sequence\">Metaethics</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lp/fake_utility_functions/\">sequence</a>\u00a0and the fictionalised dilemma <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/\">Three Worlds Collide</a>. But these mostly address utilitarians and spare other\u00a0effective altruists. Of course, Eliezer no outsider to effective altruism - he played some part in founding it. The most upvoted post on LessWrong of all time was in fact feedback <a href=\"/esswrong.com/lw/cbs/thoughts_on_the_singularity_institute_si\">from Holden Karnofsky</a>\u00a0about its sponsor-organisation MIRI. Again, the relevance of this to most EAs is a stretch.</p>\n<p>In turn, Holden Karnofsky has recieved suggestions for GiveWell might react to philosophical considerations by LessWrong veterans like <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2013/09/14/effective-altruism-and-flow-through-effects/\">Paul Christiano, Carl Shulman</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://intelligence.org/2014/01/27/existential-risk-strategy-conversation-with-holden-karnofsky/\">Eliezer</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/6o/conversation_with_holden_karnofsky_nick_beckstead/\">Nick Beckstead</a>. Again, all insiders.</p>\n<p>So here's how I sum up our problem. Almost all of our critics are insiders. Barring a couple of heroic attempts at self-criticism, we've primarily attracted criticism about donating and earning to give. We've also offended a couple of fanatics, and I don't have a strong view on whether we've learned from those. This is unsurprising. Taking self-criticism is hard and endorsing it or writing it is harder. Eliezer would say it feels like <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/\">shooting one of your own men</a>. Scott Siskind says, \"Criticizing the in-group is a really difficult project I\u2019ve barely begun to build the mental skills necessary to even consider. I can think of criticisms of my own tribe. Important criticisms, true ones. But the thought of writing them makes my blood boil.\"</p>\n<p>But criticism seems especially important now as effective altruism is growing fast, our culture is starting to consolidate on the Facebook group and here and as we model it in the\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/d1/list_of_introductory_ea_presentations/\">popular talks</a> and <a href=\"/effectivealtruism.org\">introductory</a> <a href=\"/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/\">materials</a>\u00a0that we give to new community members.</p>\n<p>To develop the effective altruist movement, it's essential that we ask people how we've failed, or how our ideas are inadequate.</p>\n<p>So an important challenge for all of us is to find better critics.</p>\n<p>Let me know if there's any big criticm that I've missed, or if you know someone who can engage with and poke holes in our ideas.</p>\n<p>Related: <a href=\"/r/main/ea/d2/the_perspectives_on_effective_altruism_we_dont/\">The perspectives on Effective Altruism we Don't Hear</a> by Jess Whittlestone. <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lr/evaporative_cooling_of_group_beliefs/\">The Evaporative Cooling of Group Beliefs</a></p></div></div>"},

In this post we explore travelling to an EA hub as a means to achieve this goal, and consider whether we would advise others to undertake the same trip we did.</p>\n<p>As an effective altruist in Australia it can feel isolating being so far away from the action. Over the December 2013 holidays, Brenton Mayer spent a month at Giving What We Can. In the Christmas period just gone, Peter McIntyre visited Oxford and the San Francisco Bay Area for a month each and <a href=\"http://rationality.org/author/peter/\">interned</a> at <a href=\"http://rationality.org/\">CFAR</a> in the latter.</p>\n<h1 id=\"What_was_it_like_\">What was it like?</h1>\n<p>In San Francisco, every morning Peter would leave his sharehouse for EAs and rationalists, \u2018Event Horizon\u2019, and head to the CFAR office, where he would sit down to do some writing for their blog.</p>\n<p>In Oxford, some of us worked if our visa allowed it, but otherwise we would rock up to the office and work on our own projects. We\u2019d have a shared lunch with the rest of the office, during which we\u2019d discuss other people\u2019s research, listen to a talk on a topic someone had studied or work on solving the big issues, like figuring out what the next SMBC comic strip should be. Outside of \u2018office time\u2019, we both stayed in houses with other EAs, going to gorgeously English pubs and having lots of interesting conversations.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Positives\">Positives</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Most importantly, visiting an EA hub can lead to a significant change in your career or life. We asked the 14 Australians who have visited an EA hub about their experiences.<a href=\"#%5B1%5D\"><sup>[1]</sup></a><a></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Acquiring contacts within the EA community can lead to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Collaborative projects you hadn't envisioned before</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ability to ask people with skills in a particular area for help</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Having a better feel for the scale and characteristics of the community</p>\n</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>If you enjoy the atmosphere, you might be more inclined to <a href=\"/ea/ey/how_i_organise_a_growing_effective_altruism_group/\">start your own group</a> back home to replicate it. </li>\n<li>\n<p>It will increase your understanding current EA best practices, rather than reinventing the wheel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It\u2019s great fun to talk about what you've been reading with people in real life, rather than just through a computer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The enjoyment of travelling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A speaker saying \u201cI volunteered for an organisation researching and running workshops on working out the bugs in our cognition\u201d conjures up more faith than \u201cSo, I read this blog right\u2026\u201d</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It might reduce value drift because you meet friends with similar goals and because the travel is a significant investment in EA.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It's a good environment for getting your own projects done:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Highly motivating (observing others' productivity + feeling them approve of your EA work)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Access to an office</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Away from normal duties at home</p>\n</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>\n<p>General personal growth:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You might learn productivity techniques.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nice environment for goal setting/career planning</p>\n</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>\n<p>When you come back and tell your friends about your experiences, you get to discuss EA in your life in a less preachy manner.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"Negatives\">Negatives</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You\u2019re part of a work environment, so while there\u2019s never any shortage of EAs to have big chats to, you need to be respectful of people\u2019s time and space. (To get around this, you could consider going to an <a href=\"http://www.effectivealtruism.org/eaglobal\">EA Global</a>.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The monetary cost - Pete spent around $5000 more than he would have at home over the same period, Brenton $4000 more. This includes travel, sightseeing etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You\u2019ll miss out on things you would have done at home (eg. Christmas, holidays at home).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The EAs who we have data on are those who have been to an EA hub, so they\u2019re highly selected for their enthusiasm and their confidence that they\u2019ll get a something out of a trip to a hub. The average EA might get less out of it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"Is_it_the_most_efficient_use_of_your_resources_\">Is it the most efficient use of your resources?</h1>\n<p>We struggled with this idea for a long time. Wouldn\u2019t we have had a greater impact by donating our money rather than travelling? The mindset of modelling everything in quantifiable terms is common but is <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/08/passive-vs-rational-vs-quantified/\">likely often harmful</a>. Nonetheless, we\u2019ll indulge your desires and have a very brief look into whether it would be worth the cash from three angles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Of the 14 surveyed Australian EAs that went on such a trip, 12 thought that it would increase their overall impact.<sup><a href=\"#%5B2%5D\">[2]</a>\u00a0</sup>Only 2 didn\u2019t think it was worth their resources as a charitable act. 9 are currently in Oxford, London or San Francisco. It\u2019s best to skim through Footnote 1 to get an idea of how the group found the experience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An Australian giving at 10% while earning an average wage (this is probably a conservative example for EAs) will give around $280 000 over their career. This implies that an EA earning and giving at that level would need to see a greater than 1.8% influence on their total giving in order to draw even in good done through their donations, in expectation.<a href=\"#%5B3%5D\"><sup>[3]</sup></a><a></a>\u00a0We could easily imagine a much larger likely increase in donations, from consideration of different careers as well as reduction in value drift. In addition to this are all the other positives discussed above, like doing collaborative projects or starting an EA group.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/02/should-i-help-now-or-later/\">80000 hours</a> and the <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/give-now-or-later/\">Global Priorities Project</a>, in a collaborative report, suggest that in our early careers, investing in personal capital is a better use of resources than donation. This seems like a pretty good way of building career capital more broadly, as well as domain-specific EA-capital.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"Summary\">Summary</h1>\n<p>We acknowledge that it seems a bit dubious to point to small changes on things like career trajectory as evidence of impact, as we have done above. However, as we\u2019ve seen, the chance of travelling to EA hubs significantly affecting the individuals actually seems quite large. We\u2019re also skeptical of our ability to have insight into this and reason counterfactually; the question serves instead as a proxy for \u2018do you think your trip was valuable?\u2019</p>\n<p>Contrary to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines\">Betteridge\u2019s law of headlines</a> (any question asked in title can be answered with 'no'), we think that visiting a hub does increase your likelihood and ability to do a lot of good. We also think this outweighs the costs. There are some thoughts in Footnote 3 regarding how to get the largest benefit from a trip.</p>\n<p>Giving What We Can <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/volunteer-or-work-us\">are currently looking for volunteers</a>, for their 2015 summer internship programme, as is the <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/04/global-priorities-project-is-looking-for-a-summer-intern/\">Global Priorities Project</a>.

The experience and the friends I now have will significantly reduce my value drift, which is possibly the most significant positive. I\u2019m also 90% sure that the trip was a better use of my resources than the relevant counterfactual. \u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Tara Mac Aulay:</strong> \u201cChange is hard, maybe 30%? I imagine I would still be working in the non-profit sector if I never visited an EA hub, so it's not that different to working at CEA, most of the changes are probably network related though.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Brayden McLean:</strong> \u201cIt\u2019s a Significant Plan change for me, for sure. 50%, probably.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Ryan Carey:</strong> \u201cIf I hadn't travelled to Oxford or SF ever, there's like &lt;50% chance I'd have ever done a msc here [in London] and &lt;20% chance I'd volunteer for CSER.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Buck Shlegeris:</strong> \u201cI moved to SF for App Academy in part because of the EA community here, but I didn\u2019t actually visit here. However, moving here was an unambiguously good decision. I have gotten an enormous amount of value from the EA community here (and my income is about doubled here compared to what it would have been in Australia). If you\u2019re a software engineer, the salary difference is such that you\u2019d be crazy not to move here if you possibly can.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Tonja Wright: </strong>\u201cVery sure - 90%. I was able to create personal relationships with highly active EAs and it led to a full-time paid EA job! My trajectory was completely changed. I spent nearly 2 months at Leverage in The Bay Area and then did a 3-4 month internship at CEA. If I didn't get hired by one of them, I was going to work at a think tank or go into politics I had many conversations with different members of the EA movement - ones I couldn't have had over the internet from Australia... they gave me lots of advice about what my next career step should be and that helped me make my final decisions on what was fast becoming a very overwhelming process. On a personal note, the chance to meet so many amazing people in the flesh and make friends with them was priceless!\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Barnett:</strong> \"I am highly (90%) confident that I made the right choice moving to the bay area. The opportunities to have a high impact are much higher here because there are more people here with both the capability and the will to impact the world for the better. I have already experienced a faster than ever growth trajectory since I moved here, which I attribute to collaborating with, learning from and being inspired by the myriad of impressive people I've met here.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Rob is now living in Oxford and is the Executive Director of the Centre for Effective Altruism.</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas Hendrey:</strong> \"Pretty undecided on my trajectory both before and after going, so I won\u2019t put figures on trajectory change. I am confident it was a better use of resources than the relevant counterfactual for me (in the sense that it was better that I went than that noone went). My relevant counterfactual wasn\u2019t very good, but I do think it is the best way of getting an understanding of the internal workings of CEA and I met lots of great people, and had lots of interesting and potentially fruitful conversations.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Frazer Kirkman:</strong> Currently my trajectory is unchanged, but I do plan to visit the Bay again. While there I met inspiring, resourceful, and interesting people. There is so much positivity being produced, I loved the lifestyle, and the mindset of so many people.</p>\n<p>The focus of this trip was to get a tech job as that seemed to be a confident way to earn to give. While I worked in tech when I was younger, the majority of my life has been as a personal well being coach, focussing on empowering people to change habits, lifestyle and life direction. While I have created a lot of altruists, it has not been financially lucrative for me. I wanted to work in a more financially stable tech role to fund future projects, and have funds to donate, or whichever method will be most effective. This was change in careers was perhaps too big of a swing from my current trajectory. I didn't find a job. I also intended to have a greater positive impact on the EA community in the Bay.

{"date": "7th May 2015", "title": "The effectiveness-alone strategy and evidence-based policy", "author": "Stefan_Schubert", "num_comments": "11 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Effective altruism could be said to consist of three claims. Call them <em>Effectiveness,</em>\u00a0<em>Altruism </em>and <em>EA-morality</em>,\u00a0respectively:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><em>Effectiveness</em></strong>: When you're acting altruistically, you should be effective.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Altruism</em></strong>: You should act altruistically a lot.</p>\n<p><em>EA-morality</em>: Global empathy, future lives are very valuable, animal lives are valuable, etc.*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Effectiveness</em><em>\u00a0</em>concerns your <em>means</em>, whereas <em>Altruism </em>and <em>EA-morality </em>concern your <em>ends.</em>\u00a0Now presumably it is, in general, easier to sell\u00a0<em>Effectiveness</em>\u00a0than\u00a0<em>Altruism </em>and\u00a0<em>EA-morality</em>, respectively<em>.\u00a0</em>Accepting\u00a0<em>Altruism</em>\u00a0means less money and time for yourself, whereas accepting <em>EA-morality </em>might mean a fundamental transformation of your moral values. Accepting\u00a0<em>Effectiveness</em><em>\u00a0</em>means none of those things. Really, it seems very hard to argue against\u00a0<em>Effectiveness</em>\u00a0(though people do try to some extent, by all means).</p>\n<p>This raises the question of whether it is wise to sell\u00a0<em>Effectiveness</em>,\u00a0<em>Altruism</em>\u00a0and <em>EA-morality</em><em>\u00a0</em>as a package deal, as it were, or whether it is better to try to sell\u00a0<em>Effectiveness</em><em>\u00a0</em>alone to some people.\u00a0</p>\n<p>An obvious option is to adapt the message to the audience: to sell the package deal to those who are likely to be open to\u00a0<em>Altruism\u00a0</em>and\u00a0<em>EA-morality</em>, but to focus on\u00a0<em>Effectiveness</em><em>\u00a0</em>when dealing with people who are unlikely to accept those other two claims.\u00a0You could also, of course, try to sell the\u00a0<em>Effectiveness</em><em>\u00a0+</em>\u00a0<em>EA-morality</em>-pair (which is what GiveWell is doing, I guess) or the\u00a0<em>Effectiveness</em><em>\u00a0+</em>\u00a0<em>Altruism</em>-pair if you think that your audience could buy them, given whatever circumstances they are in. In this post, I am, however, going to focus on the\u00a0<em>Effectiveness</em>-alone alternative.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One reason why this option is attractive is that people are already carrying out a tremendous amount of work which they claim to be altruistic. For instance, most people who do political work, in an extended sense (including voters, people who participate in internet discussions, and so on), would say that this work is being carried out for altruistic reasons. They wouldn't say that they argue for low taxes, or higher benefits, or whatever, because such policies\u00a0<em>benefit themselves</em>. Rather, they would argue that they\u00a0<em>benefit society</em>, <em>are\u00a0just</em>, or some other reason which is not specifically tied to their own good.</p>\n<p>Now of course you could argue that some of these people are fooling themselves, and that the real motives for their political actions are purely self-interested. That may be, but is irrelevant here. The fact that these people claim to be altruistic (when acting politically) suffices to make them open to criticism from\u00a0<em>Effectiveness</em>. Because, suppose that:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>1) They accept\u00a0<em>Effectiveness</em><em>.</em></p>\n<p><em></em>2) They claim to be acting altruistically when acting politically.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3) It can be shown that a set of actions suggested by the EA-community, <em>X</em>, are more effective at reaching their altruistic goals than their political actions are.</p>\n<p>From 1)-3) it follows that:</p>\n<p>4) They should change their course of action to <em>X</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This means that if we could make this existing altruistic work more\u00a0effective, that could do an enormous amount of good. There is one important caveat that must be made here, however. If people get more\u00a0effective\u00a0at reaching goals which are altruistic, as opposed to self-interested, but which are opposed to the EA-movement's goals, then that is obviously not a good thing.</p>\n<p>How much existing altruistic work, in the sense used here, has this character? Far less than usually thought, I should say. Even though there are fundamental value disagreements, most political disagreements rather stem from factual disagreements,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.owl232.net/irrationality.htm\">as Michael Huemer have argued</a>. Most people want less crime, better health, better education, more wealth, and so on (albeit to slightly different degrees). We can discuss this, however.</p>\n<p>Also, even if some people do have such \"negative\" altruistic goals, we could just avoid helping them with those, and focus on making more\u00a0effective\u00a0the altruistic work which is, at least roughly, aligned with our own goals.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I take it that some EA-organizations are already involved with making existing altruistic work more\u00a0effective. That would go for, e.g. 80,000 hours and GiveWell. However, there are many areas where lots of altruistic work is being carried out where the EA community hasn't been that much involved.</p>\n<p>One of these areas is politics. The benefits of making politics more evidence-based and rational, and thereby more\u00a0effective, should be vast.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Moreover, there is in fact already an existing movement for making politics more evidence-based. For instance, there's the <a href=\"http://coalition4evidence.org/\">Coalition for Evidence-based policy</a> in the US and the British <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/what-works-network\">What Works Network</a>. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_policy\">Evidence-based policy</a> is a catch-word in many countries (it's essentially a corollary of <em>Effectiveness\u00a0</em>and as such really hard to argue against).\u00a0</p>\n<p>This means that if the EA community would do more work on evidence-based policy, it would have many allies. This is an advantage for two reasons.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>1) It obviously increases the chances of success - of making policy more evidence-based.</p>\n<p>2) It also provides us with an opportunity to convince mere <em>Effectivists</em>, if we may call them such, to become full Effective Altruists. Once you have acquired people's confidence, it'll be easier to convince them of the more far-reaching ideas of the EA movement. This is a general advantage of the\u00a0<em>Effectiveness</em>-alone strategy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, I recently started a network for evidence-based policy in Sweden, for precisely these reasons. We're only in the start-up phase so far, but people are generally positive to the idea, which makes me think we have reasons for optimism. I'm also running a blog on rational political debate, which is attached to this network (a rational debate obviously makes rational, evidence-based policy more likely). (The <a href=\"https://dndebattbetyg.wordpress.com/\">blog is in Swedish</a> but some posts in English can be found <a href=\"https://stefanschubert.wordpress.com/\">here</a>.) This work has also been well received, and has got some limited attention by the media.</p>\n<p>I thus think there are some reasons to believe that this cause is <em>tractable</em>. It also clearly has <em>scale </em>and is relatively <em>neglected </em>(most people are working on object-level politics - for this or that political party or movement - and very few work on the meta-level, to make politics more evidence-based and rational). Hence I think it scores well on <a href=\"http://www.eaventures.org/\">all of the EA movement's three cause selection principles</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Politics is just one area, however. Ideally, we would go through all kinds of altruistic works, and point out to people that if you do this for altruistic reasons, then you should be\u00a0effective, and if so you should do <em>Y </em>instead of <em>Z</em>.</p>\n<p>I'd be interested to hearing your views both on the\u00a0<em>Effectiveness</em><em>-</em>alone strategy in general, and on the suggestion that EA-members should work on making politics more rational in particular.</p>\n<p><br><br>* Of course there is not perfect agreement among EA-members on what the EA-movement's values should be, but let's leave that aside in this post.</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "25th Feb 2015", "title": "Hope: How Far Humanity Has Come", "author": "Jess_Whittlestone", "num_comments": "6 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>This was written for the wedding ceremony of Ruby Bloom and Miranda Dixon-Luinenburg, as part of a section dedicated to affirming their shared values. The aim was to convey a sense of just how much incredible progress humanity has made, how fortunate we all are, and to motivate a feeling of hope for the future. I found it really enjoyable and motivating to write, and thought others here might find it interesting and/or motivating to read.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The world today isn\u2019t perfect - far from it. But it\u2019s also much, much, better than it used to be. Just as it\u2019s impossible for us to really feel the full extent of the suffering in the world today, we also can\u2019t really feel the full extent of the progress humanity has made.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s vital that we do, because it\u2019s that sense of progress that will give us hope, hope that the future can be better.</p>\n<p>Having hope isn\u2019t always easy. We look to the past, and we see suffering. We look at the world today, and we also see suffering. It\u2019s hard for your brain to tell the difference. 100,000 people dying feels roughly as bad as 1,000,000 people dying. But 100,000 deaths is a lot less than 1,000,000, even if it doesn\u2019t seem it. It\u2019s incredible progress.</p>\n<p>To really see progress, first we have to look backwards. Imagine what your life would have been like had you been born just 300 years ago - \u00a0as an average person living in the 1700s. There was no middle class back then, so chances are you\u2019d be poor - very poor. So poor that you stood a real chance of starving. If you were lucky, and managed to keep enough food on the table, you\u2019d still be severely malnourished - enough that you could easily be killed off by any one of the various common diseases of the time. And deadly diseases were common: if you were born in 1700 in Europe, by the age of ten you\u2019d have lived through two smallpox epidemics, a measles epidemic, and a famine. Add to this the constant threat of infection - without running water and soap, without antibiotics, a mere cut could easily kill you.</p>\n<p>You worked hard - not just long hours, but physically gruelling agricultural or industrial work. Not just physically demanding, but also physically dangerous. If you got injured, you\u2019d be on the streets, begging.</p>\n<p>As a woman, you\u2019d avoid this physically threatening labor of work, of course - replaced with your own special kind of physically threatening labor. You\u2019d probably be pregnant most of the time you weren\u2019t nursing. Infant and child mortality were ridiculously high, so you could expect to lose a lot of kids - maybe half or more. Your chances of dying during childbirth would be much, much higher than they are today - add to that the fact that you\u2019re giving birth about ten times as often, and childbirth is one of your biggest risks of dying.</p>\n<p>You couldn\u2019t vote - a privilege reserved only for landowners. You probably couldn\u2019t read - less than half the population could. There\u2019s no electricity or heating, obviously, so you just have to get used to those cold, winter, nights, and pray that the bad weather doesn\u2019t kill your crops - and your family. Your life expectancy is around 35.</p>\n<p>Now think about your own life: your warm house, electricity, clean, running water. Your smartphone, internet connection, maybe that holiday you\u2019ve got booked for a few months\u2019 time. Sure, you have stresses and worries: that you might not achieve what you could, that you don\u2019t have time to do all the things you enjoy, that someone you care about could get a rare illness. But you\u2019re only able to worry about these things because of a whole host of other worries that don\u2019t take up your time: you don\u2019t have to worry about getting enough food, about getting a small cut, about keeping fifteen children alive.</p>\n<p>The progress we\u2019ve made over the past 300 years is immense. And 300 years is nothing - an absolutely miniscule amount of time in the hundreds of thousands of years of human history.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve made insane amounts of progress. Sometimes I look at the world around me, remembering that once humans were hunter gatherers living in the natural environment, vulnerable to predators and extreme weather, and everything looks amazing. How did we get here? How did we manage to create these huge, intricate, buildings, interwoven with technology so complex most of us can\u2019t even begin to explain how it all works?</p>\n<p>Somehow, life developed on Earth from the most basic elements - and somehow incredibly, we, humans, evolved from that first basic life. We learned to hunt, to make fire, to use tools.</p>\n<p>We developed writing, allowing us to share and pass on knowledge from generation to generation. We learned to farm, leading to the agricultural revolution, and allowing people to spend their time doing things other than searching for food. Gradually, new, more complex societies were born: cities and states with different classes of people. We learned to create our own fuel from coal, built the steam engine, and began producing goods in factories. We developed more and more advanced methods of transportation, allowing us to explore the world, share ideas, and grow in wealth and power. We learned how to make vaccines, and eradicated deadly killers such as smallpox, saving 100 million lives. We invented electricity, cars, and human flight. We put a man on the moon. We built computers, and connected them all via the internet. We made these computers small enough that anyone could carry one round in their pocket at all times.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve made extraordinary progress in understanding the world around us, in learning to control our environment and guard against threats - large and small, in treating and eradicating diseases and saving lives. Every second, people are dying - but every second people are also defying death, death that would have been inevitable just a century ago.</p>\n<p>Compared to almost everyone who has ever lived in all of history, your life is awesome.</p>\n<p>Of course, even today, we\u2019re the lucky ones. The average person today is much better off than the worst-off person. Millions of people in the world still aren\u2019t so lucky - millions still live in poverty, still struggle to get enough food to get by, still die from curable diseases. But we now have the power to help people who suffer today, even those living on the other side of the world, at little cost to ourselves. Incredible advances in transport and technology mean that someone living in the Western world can save a life in developing countries at the click of a button. We\u2019re much less violent, much more compassionate, empathetic and altruistic - we have not just the practical ability to help those worse off but also increasing levels of motivation to do so.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re going to face some serious challenges over the next century, that\u2019s for certain - and of course it\u2019s possible we won\u2019t make it. But we\u2019ve also got so much progress ahead of us in the next few decades, more progress than we can imagine. The world in 30 years is likely to be pretty unrecognisable to us now. Based on the patterns of the past, if we don\u2019t off ourselves, there\u2019s a chance it\u2019s going to be unrecognisably better - that we\u2019ll have eradicated the vast majority of suffering, that we\u2019ll have a drastically better understanding of our universe and the technology to exert much greater control over it, that we\u2019re going to have moved closer towards the light.</p>\n<p>One thing I don\u2019t doubt is that we\u2019re going to put up a hell of a fight. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to survive. We\u2019re not going to sit back and let this universe engulf us. Around me, I see so much drive to fight back: to eliminate suffering, to push humanity forwards into a bright and better future, and that drive only seems to be getting stronger. And that, above all, gives me hope.</p>\n<p><em>\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},

{"date": "3rd Dec 2015", "title": "New Leverhulme Centre on the Future of AI (developed at CSER with spokes led by Bostrom, Russell, Shanahan)", "author": "Sean_o_h", "num_comments": "2 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Hot on the heels of 80K's excellent AI risk research career profile (https://80000hours.org/career-guide/top-careers/profiles/artificial-intelligence-risk-research/), we're delighted to announce the funding of a new international Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, to be led by Cambridge, with spokes at Oxford (Nick Bostrom), Imperial (Murray Shanahan), and Berkeley (Stuart Russell). The Centre proposal was developed by us at CSER, but will be a stand-alone centre, albeit collaborating extensively at CSER.</p>\n<p>Building on the by-now-familiar \"Puerto Rico Agenda\", it will have the long-term safe and beneficial development of AI at its core, but with a slightly broader remit than CSER's focus on catastrophic AI risk and superintelligence. For example, it will consider some near-term challenges such as lethal autonomous weapons, and as well as some of the longer-term philosophical and practical issues surrounding the opportunities and challenges we expect to face, should greater-than-human level intelligence be developed later this century.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It builds on the pioneering work of FHI, FLI and others, and the generous support of Elon Musk in massively boosting this field with his (separate) $10M grants programme in January of this year. One of the most important things this Centre will achieve is in taking a big step towards making this global area of research a long-term one in which the best talents can be expected to have lasting careers - the Centre is funded for a full 10 years, and we will aim to build longer-lasting funding on top of this.</p>\n<p>In practical terms, it means that ~10 new postdoc positions at a minimum will be opening up in this space (we're currently pursuing matched funding opportunities) across academic disciplines and locations (Cambridge, Oxford, Berkeley, Imperial and elsewhere). Our first priority will be to identify and hire a world-class Executive Director, who would start in October. This will be a very influential position over the coming years. Research positions will most likely begin in April 2017.</p>\n<p>In between now and then, FHI is hiring for AI safety researchers, and CSER will be hiring for an AI policy postdoc in the spring. I'll have limited time to post in between now and the Christmas break (I'll be away at NIPS and then occupied with funder deadlines and CSER recruitment), but will be happy to post more over the Christmas break if desired.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much as always to the Effective Altruism community for their support of existential risk/far future work, both financially and intellectually - it has made a huge difference over the last couple of years.</p>\n<p>Se\u00e1n (Executive Director, CSER)</p>\n<p>http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-12/uoc-cul120215.php</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Human-level intelligence is familiar in biological 'hardware' -- it happens inside our skulls. Technology and science are now converging on a possible future where similar intelligence can be created in computers.</p>\n<p>While it is hard to predict when this will happen, some researchers suggest that human-level AI will be created within this century. Freed of biological constraints, such machines might become much more intelligent than humans. What would this mean for us? Stuart Russell, a world-leading AI researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and collaborator on the project, suggests that this would be \"the biggest event in human history\". Professor Stephen Hawking agrees, saying that \"when it eventually does occur, it's likely to be either the best or worst thing ever to happen to humanity, so there's huge value in getting it right.\"</p>\n<p>Now, thanks to an unprecedented \u00a310 million grant from the Leverhulme Trust, the University of Cambridge is to establish a new interdisciplinary research centre, the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, to explore the opportunities and challenges of this potentially epoch-making technological development, both short and long term.</p>\n<p>The Centre brings together computer scientists, philosophers, social scientists and others to examine the technical, practical and philosophical questions artificial intelligence raises for humanity in the coming century.</p>\n<p>Huw Price, the Bertrand Russell Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge and Director of the Centre, said: \"Machine intelligence will be one of the defining themes of our century, and the challenges of ensuring that we make good use of its opportunities are ones we all face together. At present, however, we have barely begun to consider its ramifications, good or bad\".</p>\n<p>The Centre is a response to the Leverhulme Trust's call for \"bold, disruptive thinking, capable of creating a step-change in our understanding\". The Trust awarded the grant to Cambridge for a proposal developed with the Executive Director of the University's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER), Dr Se\u00e1n \u00d3 h\u00c9igeartaigh. CSER investigates emerging risks to humanity's future including climate change, disease, warfare and technological revolutions.</p>\n<p>Dr \u00d3 h\u00c9igeartaigh said: \"The Centre is intended to build on CSER's pioneering work on the risks posed by high-level AI and place those concerns in a broader context, looking at themes such as different kinds of intelligence, responsible development of technology and issues surrounding autonomous weapons and drones.\"</p>\n<p>The Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence spans institutions, as well as disciplines. It is a collaboration led by the University of Cambridge with links to the Oxford Martin School at the University of Oxford, Imperial College London, and the University of California, Berkeley. It is supported by Cambridge's Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH). As Professor Price put it, \"a proposal this ambitious, combining some of the best minds across four universities and many disciplines, could not have been achieved without CRASSH's vision and expertise.\"</p>\n<p>Zoubin Ghahramani, Deputy Director, Professor of Information Engineering and a Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, said: \"The field of machine learning continues to advance at a tremendous pace, and machines can now achieve near-human abilities at many cognitive tasks -- from recognising images to translating between languages and driving cars. We need to understand where this is all leading, and ensure that research in machine intelligence continues to benefit humanity. The Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence will bring together researchers from a number of disciplines, from philosophers to social scientists, cognitive scientists and computer scientists, to help guide the future of this technology and study its implications.\"</p>\n<p>The Centre aims to lead the global conversation about the opportunities and challenges to humanity that lie ahead in the future of AI. Professor Price said: \"With far-sighted alumni such as Charles Babbage, Alan Turing, and Margaret Boden, Cambridge has an enviable record of leadership in this field, and I am delighted that it will be home to the new Leverhulme Centre.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},

If you're confused about which is best (I know I am), explain the strengths and weaknesses of the causes you think might be the best. If you want, discuss your thinking on other causes that you think are promising, or that are popular in EA but you don't think are promising. You should write in sufficient detail that readers have a good understanding of why you support the cause(s) you do.</p>\n<p>If you post on the EA forum, please use the title \"My Cause Selection: &lt;Your name or username&gt;\", and tag your post with \"my-cause-selection\". If you post outside the EA forum, please write a comment here with a link to your post.</p>\n<p>You can structure your post however you like, but if you want an idea of what you could do, this is how I'm structuring mine. I explain what I value and some general considerations, and then list out every major cause area I think is plausibly the best (which includes malaria nets, deworming, animal advocacy, research on animal advocacy, AI safety, and a few others). I explain what I see as the strengths and weaknesses of each cause area and then weigh them against each other.</p>\n<p>It's not September yet, but this is a big topic, so we could use the  extra couple of weeks.

{"date": "12th Aug 2015", "title": "Why effective altruism used to be like evidence-based medicine. But isn\u2019t anymore", "author": "JamesSnowden", "num_comments": "15 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>On August 8<sup>th</sup>, Robert Wiblin, owner of probably the most intellectually stimulating facebook wall of all time asked \u201cWhat past social movement is effective altruism most similar to?\u201d This is a good question and there were some interesting answers. In the end, the most liked post (well actually the second, after Kony 2012), was \u2018evidence-based medicine\u2019. I think effective altruism used to have a lot of similarities to evidence-based medicine but is increasingly moving in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>What is it that makes them similar? Obviously a focus on evidence. \u201cEffective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that applies evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to improve the world.\u201d (Wikipedia)</p>\n<p>The trouble is, evidence and reason aren\u2019t the same thing.</p>\n<p>Reason, in effective altruism seems to often be equated with maximising expected utility. It is characterised by organisations like the Future of Humanities Institute and often ends up prioritising things for which we have almost no evidence, like protection against deathbots.</p>\n<p>Evidence is very different. It\u2019s about ambiguity aversion, not maximising expected utility. It's a lot more modest in its aims and is characterised by organisations like Givewell, prioritising charities like AMF or SCI, for which we have a decent idea of the quantum of their effects.</p>\n<p>I place myself in the evidence camp. One of the strengths of evidence-based medicine in my view is that it realises the limits of our rationality. It realises that, actually, we are VERY bad at working out how to maximise expected utility through abstract reasoning so we should actually test stuff empirically to find out what works. It also allows consensus-building by decreasing uncertainty.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t room for both. There should definitely be people in the world who think about existential risk and there should definitely be people in the world providing evidence on the effectiveness of charitable interventions. I\u2019m just not sure they should be the same people.</p>\n<p>There are also similarities between the two camps. They\u2019re both motivated by altruism and they\u2019re both explicitly consequentialist, or at least act like it. The trouble is, they also both claim to be doing <strong>the most good </strong>and so in a way they disagree. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t be worried about this. After all, healthy debate within social movements is a good thing. On the other hand, the two camps often seem to have such fundamentally different approaches to the question of how to do the most good that it is difficult to know if they can be reconciled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In any case, I think it can only be a good thing that this difference is explicitly recognised.</p></div></div>"},

Participants learn about a couple of pre-selected charities, think about and discuss their personal values and reasons for giving, consider what methods and metrics they should use to select a charity, and then vote on what charity will get a real donation. The donation is sponsored by an outside party, typically</span><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\"><span> </span><span>The Life You Can Save</span></a><span>, which donates $10 per participant to the charity that wins the vote.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>I led a Giving Game for several core organizers of Columbus Rationality, a group that popularizes strategies on improving thinking, feeling, and behavior patterns to reach one\u2019s goals.

They compare charities working in developing countries that include The Life You Can Save and </span><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\"><span>GiveWell</span></a><span>-endorsed charities that are highly effective in helping save lives and advance human flourishing, such as the</span><a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/\"><span> </span><span>Against Malaria Foundation</span></a><span> (AMF), to other charities that are less effective on this metric. The purpose of this type of Giving Game is to encourage people already interested in giving to charities working in developing countries to give to more effective charities. Another type of Giving Game compares a</span><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\"><span> highly effective international </span></a><span>charity to a local food bank or a similar local nonprofit. This type of Giving Game addresses the tendency of people to prefer to give to those they can see immediately around them, as opposed to those far away, known as the \u201c</span><a href=\"http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm\"><span>drowning child problem</span></a><span>.\u201d These two types of Giving Games address important issues, and help people recognize the value of reflecting on the</span><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Blog/ID/217/How-to-run-a-Giving-Game-and-start-a-local-chapter\"><span> </span><span>social impact of charities</span></a><span> when considering their giving.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Yet discussing a local food bank does not arouse high emotions, and it is</span><a href=\"http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jenniferlerner/files/annual_review_manuscript_june_16_final.final_.pdf\"><span> </span><span>emotions that tend to drive</span></a><span> our underlying decision making. Moreover, strong emotions cause the formation of much</span><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2265099/\"><span> </span><span>longer-lasting and easily-accessible memories</span></a><span>. Thus, I decided to choose a much more emotional charity to have a stronger impact on the participants involved, especially considering the skeptic-oriented perspective of the audience.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://choicescolumbus.org/blog/\"><span>Choices for Victims of Domestic Violence</span></a><span> serves the Columbus, OH area. It provides a shelter for victims of domestic abuse, and a hotline they can call for help, or anyone else can call for help if they suspect anyone they know suffers from domestic abuse. This charity was aimed to address at once both the drowning child problem and to provide a strong and visceral emotional appeal. AMF served as the other charity.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>As anticipated, the Giving Game itself was a powerful experience. Choices appealed to people\u2019s emotional desire to help save victims of domestic violence. This was especially so since they could identify with victims of domestic violence, since this problem impacts the kind of middle-class people to which most participants in the Giving Game belonged \u2013 unlike a local food bank, which addresses the needs of the poor. Moreover, Choices provided the audience with a hotline they can use to call if they saw someone they know suffering from domestic abuse. It also helped improve the community around themselves. AMF, however, provided a much more impactful and cost-effective way of saving people\u2019s lives and contributing to human flourishing.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>It was an intense discussion, with much back-and-forth. People realized their own intuitive biases of valuing lives near to them higher than those far away, and valuing protecting victims of domestic abuse who they could identify with over victims of malaria. They had strong emotional experiences when they made these realizations, and weren\u2019t sure whether to go with their heads in giving to the most impactful charity or with their cached patterns and intuitive beliefs.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>I wasn\u2019t sure until the end which way the vote would go. We even discussed the possibility of giving our own money to whatever charity ended up losing. We voted, and AMF did finally win out. After the vote, one of the participants told me that \u201cI feel like I need to take a shower,\u201d and expressed a strong desire to volunteer for Choices. I encouraged people to give to Choices if they feel it\u2019s important as well.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Now, some of you might feel that this was a risky move, namely pitting a highly effective charity against an emotionally appealing one like Choices. Yet think about the impact! In this Giving Game, although AMF won, people made a commitment to Choices too. So if Choices won, it is very highly likely they would give to AMF as well. Yet more than this short-term result, people are likely to be much more powerfully impacted by a Giving Game that arouses their emotions. They would be strongly moved to explore effective giving if made to face their biases. So even if AMF lost, the cause of effective giving would have won, due to the</span><a href=\"/ea/or/making_effective_altruism_more_emotionally/\"><span> </span><span>tapping of strong emotions</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Based on my experience, I encourage you to inject emotional appeal into your Giving Games, whether targeting skeptics or just a broad audience, as a means of spreading effective giving ideas effectively.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><br><span>P.S. </span><span>This article is part of the </span><a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/EA-Marketing-Resource-Bank-Rq2ckmtIxUY\"><span>EA Marketing Resource Bank</span></a><span> project lead by </span><a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/Intentional-Insights-UTiM2viNkrp\"><span>Intentional Insights</span></a><span> and the </span><a href=\"http://dotimpact.im/focusprojects/lean/\"><span>Local Effective Altruism Network</span></a><span>, with support from </span><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\"><span>The Life You Can Save</span></a><span>.</span></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "11th Aug 2015", "title": "A response to Matthews on AI Risk", "author": "RyanCarey", "num_comments": "17 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span>Dylan Matthews has written <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/8/4/9096899/cash-teach-fish\">lots</a> <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8723189/john-paulson-harvard-donation\">of</a> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/31/join-wall-street-save-the-world/\">useful</a> <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/4/24/8457895/givewell-open-philanthropy-charity\">exploratory</a> <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/7/29/9067641/william-macaskill-effective-altruism\">material</a> about EA. Of my favourite journalistic articles about effective altruism, Matthews has written about half. So I was surprised to see that after attending the recent EA Global conference, Matthews</span><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9124145/effective-altruism-global-ai\"><span> </span><span>wrote</span></a><span> that he left worried, largely because of the treatment of AI risk, a topic that seems important to me. <span>Matthews</span>'s writing, though as clear as ever, had some issues with its facts and background research that I think compromised major parts of his argument. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span>Matthews critique of AI risk mitigation was mixed in with a wide range of his experiences and impressions from the event, but still his criticism was more substantial than most, and are</span></span><span> already gaining thousands of social media shares. His main points, it seems to me, were that AI risk reduction efforts are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>self-serving</span></li>\n<li><span>self-defeating</span></li>\n<li><span>based on Pascal's Mugging, a riddle in expected value thinking.\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Let's take these in the reverse order.</span></p>\n<p><span>Conference-goers told Matthews that reducing AI risks is enormously important even if the probability of successfully mitigating those risks was arbitrarily small. Matthews reasonable identified this as an argument from </span><span>arbitrarily small probabilities of astronomical gains, known as Pascal's Mugging.\u00a0</span><span>He attributes discussion of the idea to Bostrom, and uses it it to challenge the notion of funding an AI risk charity like MIRI. </span><span>Pascal's Mugging is an interesting and contentious issue in decision theory. </span><span>But does Matthews realise that the approach was thoroughly disendorsed by MIRI years ago? If Matthews read Bostrom's piece about Pascal's Mugging to the end, and followed Bostrom's link, he would realise that the idea was originated by MIRI's founder Eliezer Yudkowsky. In Eliezer's original piece, non-credible offers of astronomical utility were not described as things to go and do, but as an unresolved puzzle.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Matthews says that to want to reduce existential risk, you have to distinguish between a probability of success of 10e-15 or 10e-50, and then throws his hands into the air exclaiming that surely noone could achieve such precision. This would be fine if Matthews had presented arguments that the likelihood of doing useful AI safety research was even less than one in a hundred. </span></p>\n<p><span>But Matthews' reservations about AI safety efforts were only a paragraph in length, and did not have such force. First, he professed some uncertainty whether AI is possible. However, this should not seriously slim the odds of reducing AI risk. T</span><span>he median AI researcher estimates even odds of human-level <a href=\"http://aiimpacts.org/ai-timeline-surveys/\">AI between 2035 and 2050</a> so the prospect that AI is possible and achievable within decades is large enough to worry about. Second, he doubts whether intelligence is sufficient to give a computer dominion over humans. But intelligence is exactly what has always given humans dominion over animals. A superintelligent AI could covertly gain extreme financial power (as trading algorithms already do), hack hardware (as academics do) and control military devices (as drone software does) --- at least!.</span><span> Third, he asks whether artificial intelligences might function just as tools, rather than as agents. But an ultra-powerful AI tool would still permit one human to wield power over all others, a problem that would still require some combination of technical and other risk-reduction research. Fourth</span><span>, he asks how we ought to define friendliness in the context of machines. But this question that has previously been of interest to MIRI researchers, and will probably return to the fold as progress is facilitated by work on underlying mathematical problems. All up, Matthews has weakly argued for uncertainty about the impact of AI and AI safety research, but then supposes that we therefore can't tell the probability of success from 10e-15 and 10e-50. If we're the kind of people who want to quantify our uncertainty, then Matthews has presented a complete non sequitur. If we're uncertain about Matthews propositions, we ought to place our guesses somewhere closer to 50%. To do otherwise would be to mistake our deep uncertainty deep scepticism. And if the prospects are decent, then as </span><span>Rob Wiblin, a speaker at the conference, has previously explained, Pascal's Mugging is not needed:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>\"While there are legitimate question marks over whether existential risk reduction really does offer a very high expected value, and we should correct for \u2018regression to the mean\u2018, cognitive biases and so on, I don\u2019t think we have any reason to discard these calculations altogether. The impulse to do so seems mostly driven by a desire to avoid the weirdness of the conclusion, rather than actually having a sound reason to doubt it.</span></p>\n<p><span>A similar activity which nobody objects to on such theoretical grounds is voting, or political campaigning. Considering the difference in vote totals and the number of active campaigners, the probability that someone volunteering for a US presidential campaign will swing the outcome seems somewhere between 1 in 100,000 and 1 in 10,000,000. The US political system throws up significantly different candidates for a position with a great deal of power over global problems. If a campaigner does swing the outcome, they can therefore have a very large and positive impact on the world, at least in subjective expected value terms.</span></p>\n<p><span>While people may doubt the expected value of joining such a campaign on the grounds that the difference between the candidates isn\u2019t big enough, or the probability of changing the outcome too small, I have never heard anyone say that the \u2018low probability, high payoff\u2019 combination means that we must dismiss it out of hand.\"</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>Since there are a wide range of proposed actions for reducing risks from artificial intelligence, some more of which I will mention, it would take extensive argumentation to suggest that the probability of success for any of them was much less than swinging an election victory. So it would not seem that</span><span> there's any need </span><span>to involve riddles in decision theory to decide whether AI safety research is something worth doing.</span></p>\n<p><span>Claiming that AI risk-reduction research would be self-defeating, Matthews says: \"It's hard to think of ways to tackle this problem today other than doing more AI research, which itself might increase the likelihood of the very apocalypse this camp frets over\". But this </span><span>sells the efforts of AI risk reducers far short. First, they are taking efforts that are political, such as ralling <a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/AI/open_letter_autonomous_weapons\">researchers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/381906/14-1190b-innovation-managing-risk-evidence.pdf\">reporting</a> to politicians. Second, there are <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/research/research-areas/\">strategy</a> and <a href=\"http://aiimpacts.org/\">technological</a></span><span> </span><span><a href=\"https://intelligence.org/all-publications/\">forecasting</a>. Overall, achieving <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/files/IE-EI.pdf\">differential progress</a> of safety technology relative to raw intelligence has been the main point of the AI risk reduction progress for years. It remains a key fixture --- see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYQrNfSmQ0M\">Russell's recent talk</a>, where he advocated promoting reverse reinforcement learning, while decreasing fine-tuning of deep neural networks. But even if Matthews disagreed with Russell's assessment, this would only disagree with one specific plan for AI risk reduction, not the validity of the enterprise altogether. There are a wide range of other approaches to safely address the safety problem, such as </span><span>rallying risk-aware researchers and politicians, and building clear strategies and timelines, that seem even more unambiguously good, and it would be odd --- to say the least --- if every one of these turned out to increase the risk of apocalypse, and that neither could any new safe courses of action be discovered.</span></p>\n<p><span>Last, Matthews argues that AI risk reduction talk could be self-serving or biased. \"At the risk of overgeneralizing, the computer science majors have convinced each other that the best way to save the world is to do computer science research.\". He later returns to the issue: \"The movement has a very real demographic problem, which contributes to very real intellectual blinders of the kind that give rise to the AI obsession.\" The problem here is that AI risk reducers can't win. If they're not computer scientists, they're decried as uninformed non-experts, and if they do come from computer scientists, they're promoting and serving themselves. In reality, they're a healthy mixture. From MIRI, </span><span>Eliezer wanted to make AI, and has had to flip into making AI safety measures. </span><span>Bostrom, who begun as a philosopher, has ended up writing about AI because it seems not only interesting, but also like an important problem. Interestingly, where Eliezer gets criticised for his overly enthusiastic writing and warmth for science fiction, Bostrom has, in order to avoid bias, avoided it entirely. </span><span>Russell begun as an AI professor, and it was only when he took sabbatical that he realised that despite Eliezer's grating writing style, he was onto something. These stories would seem to describe efforts to overcoming bias moreso than succumbing to it.</span></p>\n<p><span>Let's take on one final argument of Matthews' that also sums up the whole situation. According to Matthews, those concerned about AI risk presuppose that unborn people count equally to people alive now. To begin with, that's stronger than what Eliezer argues. Eliezer has argued that future people need only to be valuable to within some reasonable factor of present people, to be overwhelmingly important. </span><span>If our unborn children, great grandchildren and so on for a dozen generations were even 10% as important as us, then they would be more important than people currently living. If population grows in that time, or we give some moral weight to generations beyond that, or you privilege our descendants more equally to ourselves, then their value increases far beyond ours. </span><span><span><span>Even if the 8 billion people currently alive were lost to a disaster, AI or otherwise, that would be terrible. It also seems neglected, as the comparison and prioritisation of such disasters lacks an establish field in which to </span><span>receive</span><span> proper academic attention. If future generations count also, then it may be terribly worse, and the question is just how much.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><span>If Matthews just wanted to say that it's a bit awkward that people are still citing Pascal's Mugging arguments, then that would be fine. But if he was writing a piece whose main focus was his reservations about AI risk, and would widely be distributed as a critique of such, then he should have stress-tested these against the people who are working for the organisations being criticised, and who were eminently accessible to him at the recent conference. Unfortunately, it's not straightforward to undo the impact of a poorly thought-through, and shareable opinion piece. At any rate, Matthews can be one of the first to read this </span><span>counter-critique</span><span> and I'm happy to correct any errors.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span>In conclusion,\u00a0covering AI risk is hard. </span><span>AI risk reduction efforts are a mixture of CS-experts and others, who would anyway be criticised if they were composed differently. E</span><span>ven if one gives some privilege to presently alive people above our descendants, existential risks are important, and we've no reason to be so sceptical as to invoke Pascal's Mugging to support AI risk reduction.</span></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "20th Dec 2015", "title": "How big a deal could GWWC be? Pretty big.", "author": "Robert_Wiblin", "num_comments": "5 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><img src=\"https://imgur.com/D2WkgIw.png\" alt=\"\">Permit me, dear reader, the chance to dream a dream, and indulge me with a lower degree of skepticism than might be usual.</p>\n<p>Today <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> has a bit over $0.55 billion dollars pledged, between 1450 members. They have only reported giving $10 million so far, but remember that most only joined in the last 15 months, so won't have been required to report any giving yet in order to keep the pledge.</p>\n<p>The biggest charitable foundation in the world today is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wealthiest_charitable_foundations\">$42 billion</a>\u00a0in its endowment.</p>\n<p>How long would it take us to catch them? Fortunately Giving What We Can's <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/dashboard\">dashboard</a> makes it easy to do some rough calculations.</p>\n<p>Let's assume continued linear growth of the same kind we have had over the last 2 years. In the last 2 years people pledged an additional $400 million through Giving What We Can. At that rate, it would take another <em>200 years</em> to catch up! By then we would have to have 110,000 members or so, given the amount average members expect to earn and give.</p>\n<p>However, growth seems to be somewhat exponential. Membership grew 44% in 2013, 100% in 2014, and is on track to grow about 85% in 2015, for a (geometric) average growth rate of 75%.</p>\n<p>Let's say this rate of growth could be maintained - how many years to catch up now? In that case it would only take <em>9 years</em>.</p>\n<p>Is this a fair comparison?</p>\n<p>Not really. Most foundations pay out around 5% of their endowment each year, while I expect GWWC members to only pay out 3% or so. Not all will give to the best projects, though no huge foundation can spend all of their money in the best way either.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, GWWC members will quit at some rate - though not at such a rapid rate if the idea were so mainstream that hundreds of thousands were doing it.</p>\n<p>But if exponential growth could be maintained for just another few years, these effects would be overwhelmed <em>a mere 2-3 years later</em>.</p>\n<p>Is 200,000 members impossible to imagine? It remains something just 1 in 3,500 people living in rich countries - a tiny fraction of those who are, say, vegetarian, or buy 'fair trade' goods. And the necessary number of members could be a lot lower if we manage to get just a few billionaires on board in the meantime.</p>\n<p>What else could we accomplish with that kind of membership? At that point a significant mass political voice is possible, advocating for more and better aid, as just one of many possible examples. A big research effort to figure out where to direct the money could be funded for a pretty small share of the total money moved, if you think GiveWell doesn't already have it covered.</p>\n<p>Do I expect this to happen? No. But I think it's at least... 5% likely within 20 years.</p>\n<p>And I think it's a dream worth aiming for and being motivated by.</p>\n<p>Also, read my colleague Ben's piece: <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/11/take-the-growth-approach-to-evaluating-startup-non-profits-not-the-marginal-approach/\">Take the growth approach to evaluating start-up non-profits, not the marginal approach</a>.</p></div></div>"},

By doing so we partly aim to set a good first impression, make people feel welcome, and provide a point of contact for questions.<br><br>We also ask them to tell us where they first heard about EA. By doing this, we gather data about where new EAs are formed. Hopefully this data will be helpful for future marketing efforts. As joining the group requires moderator approval, this means we reached substantially every member who joined over the past 31 days. Obviously we're only sampling a subset of EAs - those that join the facebook group - but we are sending the message to ~100% of that subset, and no one else. This compares with the big <a href=\"/ea/gb/the_2014_survey_of_effective_altruists_results/\">EA census</a>, which sampled from a much wider group, but it was less clear how representative the sample was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_data\">The data</h2>\n<p>Between 2015/06/22 and 07/22, 375 people joined the group, bringing us to 6478 members.<br><br>Of the ~371 people we messaged*, 216 people responded.

In total (since the group began many years ago, and before the current moderators) 403 facebook accounts have been blocked, virtually all of which for spam. This means we must be sceptical of the 6478 members number, as many of these are probably fake accounts using the EA page to make themselves appear more credible. The new members appear to be more legitimate, but we tend to approve new members if uncertain, so there are probably fake accounts among the 375.

However, LessWrong is still a major source in our data, suggesting that the strong result in the census was not just an artifact of disproportionate sampling.<br><br>Notably, \u2018Peter Singer\u2019 was a pretty major source in our data - much higher than in the census data. Conversely, \u2018GWWC\u2019 was a much more major source in the census than in our data.

{"date": "22nd Oct 2015", "title": "Don't sweat diet?", "author": "Gregory_Lewis", "num_comments": "40 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span>Summary:\u00a0</span>Various people (Hurford, Tomasik) have tried to estimate the typical animal welfare cost of a carnivorous diet. These costs have encouraged EAs to become vegetarians or vegans, and EAs particularly focused on animal welfare advocate that others (including EAs) should reduce their consumption of animal products.</p>\n<p>Closely following an estimate by Kaufman, I consider the face value of abstaining from dairy or abstaining from all animal products in terms of donations to ACE-recommended animal welfare charities: &lt;1 cent per year given to The Humane League would offset typical dairy consumption, and &lt;$1 year would offset a typical American\u2019s consumption of all animal products. Thus the emphasis on dietary change\u00a0<em>intra</em>-EA\u00a0seems misplaced: it is extraordinarily\u00a0<em>low\u00a0</em>impact compared to other means to helping animals.\u00a0<a></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</h1>\n<p>Industrial agriculture produces vast amounts of animal suffering: not only are billions killed each year, but their lives are often horrible \u2013 so much so that informed observers consider their lives to be not worth living. Given this suffering is generated to satiate human\u2019s relatively trivial desire to eat meat, eggs, and dairy, reducing consumption of these products can relieve vast amounts of suffering. Many effective altruists think this (and animal welfare) is the most important thing to work on right now, and encourage others to become vegetarian and vegan. Many other effective altruists, even if they aren\u2019t primarily focused on animal welfare, are vegetarian and vegan due to this reasoning..</p>\n<h1 id=\"How_much_is_being_vegan_worth_\">How much is being vegan worth?</h1>\n<p>Effective altruists like quantification and trying to weigh the relative importance of different courses of action. This gives surprising answers in case of veganism.</p>\n<p>Working out exactly how much suffering is hard. Happily, much of this work has already done by Brian Tomasik on the \u2018<a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods/\">suffering per calorie\u2019 estimates of animal food products</a>, and subsequently by Peter Hurford on the\u00a0<a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-suffering-is-in-the-standard-american-diet/\">suffering typically accrued by a typical American\u2019s diet</a>. Jeff Kaufmann recently used these figures to compare the \u2018<a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/how-bad-is-dairy\">value\u2019 of abstaining from dairy in terms of a donation to AMF</a>. A precis:</p>\n<p>A typical american dairy consumption is 1/45th of a dairy cow\u2019s annual output. Thus consuming dairy for 45 years is approximately a \u2018single year of cow life\u2019 (ignoring elasticities). $100 is thought to avert 1 DALY if given to AMF. So if you think a year of cow life averted is about as valuable as one year of human life, then a couple of dollars given to AMF approximately offsets the harm of dairy.</p>\n<p>This calculation is necessarily rough, and perhaps the principal problem is comparing \u2018years as a dairy cow\u2019 versus \u2018years as a human\u2019. Many people will say that human lives are worth more, but others (particularly EAs interested in animal advocacy) might argue that averting years of dairy cow life is more valuable to adding years of human life.</p>\n<p>The advent of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>\u00a0allows a more \u2018apples to apples\u2019 comparison, as they offer rough estimates of how effective their charities are in terms of \u2018animal lives in agriculture\u2019 averted, which is about the same outcome as we expect from reducing our consumption. These figures are remarkably high: ACE\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/the-humane-league/\">estimates the Humane League</a>\u00a0as averting 3.4 lives for every\u00a0<em>dollar</em>\u00a0spent. It rates Mercy for Animals and Animal Equality International even higher, at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/mercy-for-animals/\">8.8 animals/$</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/animal-equality/\">10.1 animals/$</a>.</p>\n<p>A comparison between donations to THL and abstaining from dairy is instructive. 1/45th of a cow life per year, divided by 3.4 lives per dollar:</p>\n<pre>Price (in THL donations) of dairy = 1/45 years / 3.4 years/$\n= $0.0065</pre>\n<p>Less than a cent per year to THL (the least cost-effective of ACE\u2019s recommendations) does as much good as abstaining from dairy from the same period, and this might be\u00a0<em>conservative</em>\u00a0(we\u2019ve assumed that animal lives only last one year,\u00a0<em>inter alia</em>).</p>\n<p>Dairy is the least harmful of animal products in the typical diet. Consider instead going from a typical american diet to veganism.\u00a0<a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-suffering-is-in-the-standard-american-diet/\">Peter Hurford helpfully provides</a>\u00a0the following estimated relative harms of different animal products in the typical american diet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Giving up beef is ~2.1x as important as giving up dairy.</li>\n<li>Giving up beef is ~1.9x as important as giving up turkey.</li>\n<li>Giving up pork is ~2.9x as important as giving up beef.</li>\n<li>Giving up chicken meat is ~11.3x as important as giving up beef.</li>\n<li>Giving up eggs is ~11.8x as important as giving up beef.</li>\n<li>Giving up aquacultured fish is ~6.4x as important as giving up beef.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can convert the relevant foods into \u2018dairy equivalents\u2019.</p>\n<pre>Dairy - 1\nBeef - 2.1\nPork - 6.1 (2.1*2.9)\nChicken - 23.7 (2.1*11.3)\nEggs - 24.8 (2.1*11.8)\nFish - 13.4 (2.1*6.4)\nTOTAL - 71.1</pre>\n<p>So the typical american diet is 71.1 times worse than only consuming dairy but abstaining from meat and eggs. We can recalculate the value of turning vegan in terms of yearly THL donations:</p>\n<pre>Price (in THL donations) of veganism = 1/45 * 71.1 / 3.4 years/$\n= $0.46</pre>\n<p>So being vegan for a year is about as good as giving 46 cents to the humane league.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Sources_of_uncertainty\">Sources of uncertainty</h1>\n<p>This seems remarkably cheap. Should we believe this calculation?</p>\n<p>I have made a few short-cuts, and a more careful calculation could be made (perhaps recalculating the animal welfare costs from Hurford rather than taking the bottom line estimates, or dis-aggregating \u2018animals\u2019 when looking at the benefit of abstaining from dairy alone). However, it the \u2018bottom line\u2019 figure isn\u2019t sensitive enough to these factors to be driven up by several orders of magnitude. Hurford also estimates the typical American diet causes 5.5 years of animal suffering per year. Using this directly gets a factor of 4:</p>\n<pre>Price (in THL donations of veganism = 5.5 years/3.4 years/$\n= $1.62</pre>\n<p>Further, several elements of the calculation were\u00a0<em>conservative:\u00a0</em>I\u2019ve ignored elasticities (which would reduce the amount of animal suffering dietary change would avert), I\u2019ve assumed that all animals saved would live for a year, and I\u2019ve picked THL instead of 2-3x better performing AE or MfA. Scott Alexander has\u00a0<a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/23/vegetarianism-for-meat-eaters/\">made a similar calculation</a>\u00a0to mine using similar data, and gets similar \u2018bottom line\u2019 figures.</p>\n<p>Perhaps weakest component in the calculation is the cost effectiveness of the animal charities. One may think the estimates are too good to be true. Even if one cannot see any obvious feature of over-estimation, regression to the mean means that the estimated-to-be-best charities\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/why-the-tails-come-apart/\">will be generally\u00a0<em>over</em>estimated</a>, and this effect can bite particularly hard if the distribution is log-normal or broader.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Is_veganism_worth_it_\">Is veganism worth it?</h1>\n<p>Taking these calculations at face value suggests individual dietary change is unimportant, with an equivalent donation value of a handful of dollars each year. Given most people would prefer to keep their current carnivorous diet for more than this amount, this suggests offsetting donations are much better for most than diet change. (Of interest, if milk substitutes are even 1 cent more expensive over the year, then returning to milk and donating the difference seems a better strategy.)</p>\n<p>If one is pessimistic about the estimates ACE gives, and anticipates a 3 or 4 order of magnitude correction, then the price of veganism does rise to the level where people might prefer to change diet rather than give moral offsets. However, most animal focused EAs I\u2019ve talked to seem optimistic that ACE\u2019s estimates are not dramatic over-estimates. This optimism seems incongruous with their eagerness to get EAs and EA events to be vegan: persuading them to give their pocket change to THL seems much easier (and better for animal welfare!) than getting them to change their diets. Dietary change looks like a very ineffective intervention.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Sundries\">Sundries</h3>\n<p>I foresee two main objections, given the remarks Jeff\u2019s post gathered.</p>\n<p>The first is that unlike donation targets, veganism and giving money to THL are not mutually exclusive, so there is no trade-off \u2013 just do both! Yet although veganism may not draw directly on our donation budget, it may plausibly draw on our budgets of self-sacrifice and self-control. There are other unpleasant actions we could take which are independent of donations (having cold showers to reduce energy expenditure and thus climate change), which most of us intuit probably aren\u2019t worth it in terms of indirect costs due to their limited impact. I aver that for most people changing their diet, given the extremely low monetary value of an offsetting donation, falls below this threshold. (For those for whom it doesn\u2019t, go vegan!)</p>\n<p>The second that this analysis only tries to model \u2018first order\u2019 impacts. Being vegetarian or vegan might have a larger impact in terms of persuading others to become vegetarian or vegan, and generally act to signal dismay at animal agriculture. It looks hard for an animal welfare advocate getting any traction if they eat meat. These \u2018second order\u2019 effects are hard to quantify, but I struggle to think they would be worth more than 10x or 100x the \u2018direct impact\u2019 of not eating animal products for most people who aren't spending most of their energies being animal advocates. I have been a vegetarian all my life, and I have mentioned it in conversation less than 50 times, and I doubt much more than half the people who know me\u00a0<em>also</em>\u00a0know I\u2019m a vegetarian, and much fewer the reasoning why. The amount of \u2018second order effects\u2019 of my vegetarianism on animal welfare are wholly trivial, and I doubt I\u2019m wildly away from the population mean in terms of second order impacts.</p></div></div>"},

My default is to be humble and avoid showing off. I didn\u2019t want others around me to think that I have a stuffed head and hold too high an opinion of myself. I also didn\u2019t want them to judge my giving decisions, as some may have judged them\u00a0negatively. I also had cached patterns of associating sharing about my good deeds publicly with feelings that I get from commercials, of self-promotion and sleaziness.</p>\n<p>I wish I had known back then that I could have done <strong>much more good by publicizing my donations and other goods deeds, such as signing the <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/become-member\">Giving What We Can Pledge</a> to donate 10% of my income to effective\u00a0charities.</strong></p>\n<p>Why did I change my mind about being public? Let me share a bit of my background to give you the appropriate\u00a0context.</p>\n<p>As long as I can remember, I have been interested in analyzing how and why individuals and groups evaluated their environment and made their decisions to reach their goals \u2013 rational thinking. This topic became the focus of my research as a <a href=\"https://history.osu.edu/people/tsipursky.1\">professor at Ohio State</a> in the history of science, studying the intersection of psychology, cognitive neuroscience, behavioral economics, and other\u00a0fields.</p>\n<p>While most of my colleagues focused on research, I grew more passionate about sharing my knowledge with others, focusing my efforts on high-quality, <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2013/10/18/class-sourcing-teaching-strategy-essay\">innovative teaching</a>. I perceived my work as cognitive altruism, sharing my knowledge about rational thinking, and students expressed much appreciation for my focus on helping them make better decisions in their lives. Separately, I engaged in anonymous donations to causes such as poverty\u00a0alleviation.</p>\n<p>Yet over time, I realized that by teaching only in the classroom, I would have a very limited impact, since my students were only a small minority of the population I could potentially reach. I began to consult academic literature on how to spread my knowledge broadly. Through reading classics in the field of social influence such as <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=5dfv0HJ1TEoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+influence+cialdini&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0zZf8jNnJAhWDQyYKHVwFAcoQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20influence%20cialdini&amp;f=false\"><em>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</em></a> and <a href=\"http://heathbrothers.com/books/made-to-stick/\"><em>Made To Stick</em></a>, I learned a great many strategies to multiply the impact of my cognitive altruism work, as well as my charitable\u00a0giving.</p>\n<p>One of the most important lessons was <strong>the value of being public about my activities.</strong> Both <em>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</em> and <a href=\"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2007/october/docs/01features_01.htm\">subsequent research</a> showed that our peers deeply impact our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. We tend to evaluate ourselves based on what our peers think of us, and try to model behaviors that will cause others to have positive opinions about us. This applies not only to in-person meetings, but also <a href=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/289092.php\">online\u00a0communities</a>.</p>\n<p>A related phenomenon, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof\">social proof</a>, illustrates how we evaluate appropriate behavior based on how we see others behaving. However, <a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/news/2011/10/07/family-and-peers-have-big-impact-on-health/30146.html\">research also shows</a> that people who exhibit more beneficial behaviors tend to avoid expressing themselves to those with less beneficial behaviors, resulting in overall social\u00a0harm.</p>\n<p>Learning about the importance of being public, including in online communities that reach far more people than in-person communities, especially by people engaging in socially beneficial habits, led to a deep transformation in my civic engagement. While it was not easy to overcome my shyness, I realized I had to do it if I wanted to optimize my positive impact on the world \u2013 both in cognitive altruism and in effective\u00a0giving.</p>\n<p>I shared this journey of learning and transformation with my wife, Agnes Vishnevkin, an <span>MBA</span> and non-profit professional. Together, we decided to co-found a nonprofit dedicated to spreading rational thinking and effective giving to a broad audience using research-based strategies for maximizing social impact, <a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/Intentional-Insights-Spreading-Effective-Altruism-Effectively-to-Broad-Audiences-UTiM2viNkrp\">Intentional Insights</a>. Uniting with others committed to this mission, we write articles, blogs, make videos, author books, program apps, and collaborate with other organizations to share these ideas\u00a0widely.</p>\n<p>I also rely on research to make other decisions, such as my decision to take the <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/become-member\">Giving What We Can pledge</a>. The strategy of <a href=\"http://www.refocuser.com/2009/07/precommitment-commit-in-advance-to-keep-yourself-on-track/\">precommitment</a> is key here \u2013 we make a decision in a state where we have the time to consider their consequences in the long term, and specifically wish to constrain the options of our future selves. That way, we can plan within a narrowed range of options and make the best possible use of the resources available to\u00a0us.</p>\n<p>Thus, I can plan to live on 90% of my income over my lifetime, and plan to decrease some of my spending in the long term so that I can give to charities that I believe are most effective for making the kind of impact I want to see in the\u00a0world.</p>\n<p>Knowing about the importance of publicizing my good deeds and commitments, I recognize that <strong>I can do much more good by sharing my decision to take the pledge with others.</strong> All of us have friends, and the large majority of us have social media channels and we all have the power to be public about our good deeds. You can also consider\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/take-action.html\">fundraising</a> <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-07-06/what-kind-fundraiser-are-you\">for</a> effective charities, and <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/post/2015/07/tell-all-your-friends/\">being an advocate</a> for effective altruism in your community.\u00a0<strong></strong></p>\n<p>According to the scholarly literature, by being public about our good deeds we can bring about much good in the world. Even though it may not feel as tangible as direct donations, sharing with others about our good deeds and supporting others doing so may in the end allow us to do even more\u00a0good.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>P.S. </span><span>This article is part of the </span><a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/EA-Marketing-Resource-Bank-Rq2ckmtIxUY\"><span>EA Marketing Resource Bank</span></a><span> project lead by </span><a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/Intentional-Insights-UTiM2viNkrp\"><span>Intentional Insights</span></a><span> and the </span><a href=\"http://dotimpact.im/focusprojects/lean/\"><span>Local Effective Altruism Network</span></a><span>, with support from </span><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\"><span>The Life You Can Save</span></a><span>.</span></p></div></div>"},

And of course you can have a huge huge impact on the world by encouraging people to do good and to think more carefully about how they do good.</p>\n<p>I started organising regular EA social events in London in the summer of 2013. I had for a while been helping organise irregular GWWC events, then, one day, I thought why not try something a little different. I arranged an evening at a pub with a friend, created an EA social Facebook event and invited anyone who I thought might be interested. It went well and I have been creating infrequent social events ever since.</p>\n<p>I recently came to the rather surprising realisation that the EA London group was growing quite fast. This was particularly curious because for quite a while I had been putting in less than 30 minutes a month. Essentially the only organising I had been doing was taking the responsibility to choose a time and place for a social event and posting this on Meetup.com and Facebook about once a month.</p>\n<p>Now perhaps it is just chance that the group has grown of late, some twist of fate or flimsy whim of the gods. But either way it was suggested that I write my tips down on paper (well screen). The recipe below describes how I have organised things in London. Everywhere is different but I hope some of this is useful to someone.</p>\n<p>The rest of the article from hereon in has been cross-posted to the EA Wikipedia so that others can add their advice.

This page is aimed at non-students living in a city that does not already have an effective altruism group, who may not have much time to put into growing a group but who will be in the same city for a prolonged period of time.\u00a0This post does not set out the ideal way to run a local group but sets out how to run and grow a group if optimising for investing a minimal amount of time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Building_a_group___first_event\"><strong><span>Building a group \u2013 first event</span></strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create a Facebook event</strong><span>\u00a0for a social event and invite friends of yours who you think might be interested. Have at least one friend who can definitely come, so if your event is not popular you are not sitting alone for an evening. Choose a time (Eg. evening/weekend) and place (Eg. pub/bar/caf\u00e9/arts centre/etc) that people should be able to make.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><strong>Turn up</strong><span> and have a pleasant evening.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Well done - you have started a local group!! It should take about 20 minutes to organise a first event. Once this is done <strong>you can use Facebook to create future events and automatically invite all the same people</strong> by going to the first event on Facebook and clicking \" \u2022\u2022\u2022 \" then clicking \"copy event\".</p>\n<p>EXAMPLES:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/488224411226931/\">EA London first event</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/757376197665390/\">EA Leeds first event</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Building_a_group___get_an_online_presence\"><strong><span>Building a group \u2013 get an online presence</span></strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create a Meetup.com group and/or create a Facebook group and/or start and email list and/or find other places online to post events. </strong><span>It is useful to have an online platform which can gradually grow in membership and from which events can be publicised. A good online platform (<strong>I highly recommend Meetup.com</strong>) will help your group grow without you having to do extra work or publicity. Posting about each event in more places will help your group grow faster but will take some a little bit of extra time on a regular basis to copy and paste across the event details. EA London posts all events on Meetup and on Facebook. See below for more advice on different online platforms.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><strong>Host more social events. </strong><span>See below for advice on running events.

List your group on the </span><a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/groups\">EA Hub</a><span>. Maybe even add the occasional event on to the </span><a href=\"/meetups/new/\">EA forum</a><span>.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><strong>Let other groups know you exist. </strong><span>Tell the people who run other groups whose members might be interested about your group. Ideally tell them about a specific relevant upcoming event. People to tell would be local groups for: Less Wrong, students, philosophy, charity, atheist and humanists, religions, RESULTS, etc.</span></li>\n</ol><!--[if !supportLists]-->\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Building_a_group___try_things\"><strong><span>Building a group \u2013 try things</span></strong></h2>\n<p>Trying something slightly different every few months is low cost and will allow you to gradually work out what works best in your city. You can experiment with: Frequent / infrequent events. Regular times / ad hoc times. Evenings / weekends. East side of town / west side of town. Different ways of describing the event. Etc.

In London this whole process was spread out over about a year and took a small amount of time each month. Alternatively you can take a single evening to kickstart the process and do all of the above steps at once.</p>\n<p>Below is more advice to make sure that events run smoothly and that the group does not fail.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Additional_tips___Choosing_online_platforms\"><strong><span>Additional tips \u2013 Choosing online platforms</span></strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Meetup.com </strong><span>has a cost but it has really helped the EA London group grow. It may not work for your city but it is likely to be worth trying. Keep the description snappy, make sure you add lots of popular \u201clabels\u201d so that your event will be found.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><strong>A Facebook group </strong><span>(not a Facebook page) lets people add their friends to the group and events turn up on people\u2019s Facebook newsfeed. If you create a Facebook group add anyone who you think would be interested and then when you create future events create them from the Facebook group so people in the group are automatically invited.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><strong>Other platforms.</strong><span> Consider looking for other websites where events are posted. For example Eventbrite or Time Out or Yelp. Try googling \u201c</span><em>how to meet new people in [city]</em><span>\u201d or \u201c</span><em>finding interesting events in [city]</em><span>\u201d and seeing what websites appear prominent.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>EXAMPLES:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Effective-Altruism-London/\">EA London meetup group</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/EALondon/\">EA and GWWC London Facebook group</a> (click <em>About</em> to see the description.

People turn up when they want and discuss whatever takes their fancy, often including effective altruism.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose a time</strong><span>. In London we tend to meet at 7pm on a weekday evenings. Increase the regularity of events as the group grows. In London we started off with events every few months, then every other month, then every month, and now a few times a month. As the group grows having a fixed time for events (Eg. 1</span><sup>st</sup><span> Tuesday of each month) can help people plan around them.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><strong>Choose a place</strong><span>. In London we tend to meet in a centrally located pub. The ideal location will be somewhere cheap, without background music, with some vegetarian/vegan foodstuffs where space can be pre-booked.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><strong>Theme</strong><span>. People are more likely to attend events and enjoy events more if each event has a specific theme. It helps give people something to discuss and a reason to talk about EA topics as well as educating people about the key questions that underpin the EA movement. Put a list of interesting questions in the event description. (Optionally print of some articles that are connected to the theme. This can help spark interest and conversation but can also be a sizable time sink.)<br><br></span></li>\n<li><strong>Event description</strong><span>. Remember that your target audience for the description is not people who turn up every week but the people most likely to be persuaded to turn up with a good event description (ie. new people or people who have only attended once). Be welcoming. Describe something about effective altruism. Add a phone number so people can find you. Make it clear that people can turn up at any time.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><strong>Print Signs</strong><span>. Have signs so people can find you. </span><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwwvTgW1FiT_WEVmNkxkazhuN0k/view?usp=sharing\">Example</a><span>.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><strong>Have leaflets</strong><span>. The main benefit here is for people who have been brought along by a friend or by word of mouth and are keen to sign up on Facebook / Meetup / etc. A small piece of paper with a short explanation of effective altruism and a link to any Facebook / Meetup / etc groups would suffice.</span>\u00a0</li>\n</ol>\n<p>EXAMPLES:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/268860213289681\">Effective Altruism fun pub times!!</a><span> (Theme: Giving strategically)</span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/211537855668032\">Effective Altruism fun pub times!!

Most EA groups that have fizzled out have done so because the leaders have had limited success at growing the group, have felt disheartened and given up. To avoid this:</span> \n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aim low and you will not be disappointed.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Be aware of the huge potential benefit of EA outreach</strong><span>. Read <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/04/the-haste-consideration/\">haste consideration</a> and do a back of the envelope calculations.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Have fun</strong><span>. Make sure you enjoy the events. Do not get stressed organising things - organise things at your convenience. Finding a co-organiser may help.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Put less time into running the group</strong><span> (see below).</span>\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Feeling like this is a sub-optimal use of time</strong><span>. Put less time in but keep events going. Eg have events every 2 months. Copy and paste the same event description for each event. Organise them at your convenience (oh I am meetup up with a friend that evening anyway so I can make it an EA event and invite others). If people ask for more events then suggest they organise them. If necessary try to hand over (see below).<br>\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><strong>Handovers</strong><span> can be difficult (without significant effort). If you think there is a high chance that you will leave a town in less than a year then maybe don\u2019t start a group like this. Ask lots of people and pressure them into helping. Write a very detailed handover note with everything you can think of.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><strong>Feeling like this is a sub-optimal use of money</strong><span>. Ask me (Sam) and I can pay for the cost of a meetup group. Or maybe ask Giving What We Can (</span><a href=\"mailto:information@givingwhatwecan.org\">information@givingwhatwecan.org</a><span>). Remember 1 Meetup account can host 3 groups.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><strong>Group does not grow at all</strong><span>. Bigger groups grow faster \u2013 if the group is not growing you could try some of the </span><strong>additional things to do with extra time </strong><span>that are listed below. If you can or find someone to organise one big event \u2013 such as a famous talker that may be all the group needs.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Additional_tips___Things_to_do_with_extra_time\"><strong><span>Additional tips \u2013 Things to do with extra time</span></strong></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Speaker events</strong><span>. A single big well publicised event can help group the group significantly. In London we had Peter Singer come and talk to a crowd of 400 and this helped the group take off (</span><a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/peter-singer-effective-altruism-a-new-movement-emerges-tickets-11763193027\">event</a><span>).<br><br></span></li>\n<li><strong>Other kinds of events</strong><span>. For resources on other events see </span><a href=\"/ea/a6/outreaching_effective_altruism_locally_resources/\">this post</a><span>. Examples to consider: </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1066695483346249\">volunteer-a-thons</a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/275062456024101\">dinners</a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/657005137695116\">small talks</a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/497803373678819\">interactive theatre</a><span>, and so on.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><strong>Responding to emails and communication</strong><span>. As the group leader your main time sink after creating (and attending) the event each month or so will be responding to emails form people who are interested in EA. The easy thing to do is to ignore these or send a standard message to people. Being polite and responding to individual emails is likely to be a useful way to spend extra time.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Keep trying things</strong>.\u00a0With more time your experiments into how best to run the group can be bigger and more rigorous. You can trial different kinds of events or having a to do list with tasks that anyone can take on or sending a personal message to new members and so on.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},

It\u2019s highly unclear to us how valuable this is: it\u2019s perfectly plausible to us that this will involve generating a lot of noise, but that this won\u2019t ultimately generate much value; it\u2019s also plausible to us that it will lead to significant connections that wouldn\u2019t have otherwise happened. It may also be that some sorts of media attention are much more valuable than others. For these reasons, and because we feel we don\u2019t currently have a good understanding of these issues, we\u2019re conceiving of this aspect of EA Outreach as an experiment. We\u2019ll therefore periodically take the opportunity to reflect on aspects of our media initiatives, so that we can better assess whether we should continue with this aspect of our strategy, and if so in what way we should approach it. It seems almost impossible to get high-quality evidence on the issues that we care about in this area, so in our \u2018experimentation\u2019 strategy we are forced to rely on a small number of data points and a lot of reflection.</p>\n<p>In 2014, getting media attention for EA was not one of our aims. However, the popularity of my ALS ice bucket challenge article provided us with an opportunity to do some media outreach and start some discussion of effective altruism in the media. In this post, I describe what happened, what short-term and long-term impact I think it had, and what lessons I took away from it.</p>\n<p><a></a></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Background\">Background</strong></p>\n<p>On August 14, 2014, I wrote an article on the Ice Bucket Challenge for Quartz, which the magazine entitled \u201c<a href=\"http://qz.com/249649/the-cold-hard-truth-about-the-ice-bucket-challenge/\"><span>The Cold Hard Truth about the Ice Bucket Challenge</span></a>.\u201d It became extremely popular. We can\u2019t disclose the viewing figures, but it received about nine times as many views as my second most popular article, and 30 times as many views as my median article. The article <a href=\"http://www.sharedcount.com/%22%20%5Cl%20%22url=http://qz.com/249649/the-cold-hard-truth-about-the-ice-bucket-challenge/\"><span>received</span></a> 141 Google+ shares, 467 LinkedIn shares, 1490 tweets, 16,008 Facebook shares and 41,967 Facebook likes. It also led to a significant amount of attention in other venues, with coverage in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/05/als-ice-bu\"><span><em>The Guardian</em></span></a>, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/11058891/Why-I-turned-down-the-Ice-Bucket-Challenge.html\"><span><em>The Telegraph</em></span></a>, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-ice-b\"><span><em>Los Angeles Times</em></span></a>, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/better-ice-bucket-challenge\"><span><em>The New Yorker</em></span></a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29013707\"><span>BBC News</span></a>, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-bucket-challenge-more-than-just-hashtag-activism/\"><span>CBS News</span></a>, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/8/20/6040435/als-ice-bucket-challenge-and-why-we-give-to-charity-donate\"><span>Vox</span></a>, <a href=\"http://www.slate.fr/\"><span>Slate</span></a>, and dozens of other news sources, and appearances from Niel Bowerman and I in international <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04g1drf\"><span>radio</span></a> and <a href=\"http://stream.aljazeera.com/sto\"><span>television</span></a>.</p>\n<p>The article had a mixed reception. \u00a0Of those we sampled, most twitter shares were positive; most facebook comments were critical.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On August 18, I wrote a follow-up article, which Quartz entitled \u201c<a href=\"/%22htt\"><span>This week, let\u2019s dump a few ice buckets to wipe out malaria too</span></a>\u201d (again, I wasn\u2019t responsible for the title). This one received the typical number of views.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Positive_impact\">Positive impact</strong></p>\n<p>The short-run impact of the article was as follows:</p>\n<p><strong><em>Referrals to GiveWell</em></strong><em>:</em> ~10,000 unique visitors. Elie told me that, on average, 1 in 200 unique visitors donate, that the average donation is ~$1000, and that he estimates that 50% of people are repeat donors. However, we both agree that these numbers would give too high an estimate of the value of a unique visitor, because much of GiveWell\u2019s money moved comes from very large donors, who have heard about GiveWell from multiple sources.</p>\n<p>From their <a href=\"http://files.givewell.org/files/images/GiveWell%20Metrics%20Report%20%E2%80%93%202013.pdf\"><span>2013 metrics data</span></a>, $3mn was moved via small donors (less than $10k) in 2013. On average, 14% of donors came via online referral; assuming that this is representative for small donors that would give $420,000 via online referral. There were 151,000 visitors via referral links, giving a money moved per visitor figure of $2.78.</p>\n<p>Using this number, the Quartz article would have moved $27,800 (not including regular giving beyond a year). This was quickly estimated, and there may well be errors in this assessment, and still seems somewhat too high to me. We could therefore give cautious bounds of between $5,000 and $50,000 moved as a result of the article.*</p>\n<p><strong><em>Referrals to Giving What We Can:</em></strong> ~9,000 unique visitors. Soon after the article, we received 3 pledges and 8 try out givers who cited \u2018on-line article\u2019. We\u2019ll follow up with these people, but it\u2019s likely that not all were influenced by the Quartz article, rather than some other online article. If we assume 3 pledges only, the article raised approximately $1\u00a0million in pledged donations. Converting this into the value of present donations is a tricky issue, but my guess is that the long-run money moved via new pledges is somewhat greater than that via increased traffic to GiveWell\u2019s site.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Donations to SCI: </em></strong>As a result of the initial article I wrote, Tim Harford invited Niel Bowerman from CEA and Elie Hassenfeld from GiveWell onto BBC Radio 4\u2019s \u2018More or Less\u2019 show on \u2018the numbers behind the news\u2019 to discuss effective altruism. \u00a0This resulted in follow-up pieces on the popular More or Less\u2019s podcast, in BBC magazine, and in the Financial Times. \u00a0In the interview with Tim Harford, Elie and Niel discussed SCI, and Tim Hartford decided to donate there at the end of the show. \u00a0After the appearances, SCI contacted us to report that they had received several \u00a31000s of donations as a result of our media. \u00a0The exact amount SCI received as a result of this media attention was difficult for them to estimate relative to the variable background rate, but they suggested it may have been as much as \u00a310,000. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Given these figures, and given the fact that an article as successful as the ice bucket article is perhaps a one in twenty event, my impression is that the short-run benefits of writing articles are not themselves sufficient to justify the time investment, compared to other sorts of outreach.</p>\n<p>However, my guess is that the main benefit of media attention is longer-term: leading to further media opportunities in the future; improving my position as a public advocate of effective altruism; increasing the real-world credibility of the effective altruism movement; generating connections with people who we wouldn\u2019t otherwise have met; and, most importantly, learning via practical experience of engaging in the media.</p>\n<p>This view is consistent with our conclusions from previous media rounds. Relative to the size of the media attention Giving What We Can and 80,000 Hours has had in previous years, the short-run benefit has been lower than one would expect. However, it has led to some of our most valuable relationships, with people who were initially in very different circles, who we would not otherwise have met.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Why_was_the_article_so_popular_\">Why was the article so popular?</strong></p>\n<p>My leading explanations (in order of plausibility; not mutually exclusive) are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Snowball effects</li>\n<li>The article piggy-backed on an extremely popular trend.\u00a0</li>\n<li>The title of the article was particularly good at arousing interest.</li>\n<li>The article defended a minority position.</li>\n<li>The article discussed an issue that\u2019s rarely covered in the media.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Mistakes_made\">Mistakes made</strong></p>\n<p>In my view, the article is of lower quality than other Quartz articles I\u2019ve written. It was written quickly; it half-makes several distinct points rather than having one clear focused point; given that people many find the central points surprising, it made those points too hastily; and at times the tone was unnecessarily snarky.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I do not know if I should have spent more time on the article to improve its quality. If I\u2019d known how popular it would be, then I certainly should have done; but I didn\u2019t know that (nor did I know how popular Quartz articles could get). Moreover, I have a distinct worry that what I call poor quality was a <em>positive</em> factor, in terms of the article\u2019s popularity. People are more easily annoyed\u2014and more likely to voice their annoyance on social media\u2014at articles with poorly justified claims; readers will more easily read whatever they want into vague or ambiguous statements; and an article with several distinct claims has a higher chance of piquing the reader\u2019s curiosity. This explanation, if true, would be deeply depressing, but would also explain a lot about the poor quality of many popular articles. This could be investigated further by, for example, looking at popular writers, and seeing how the quality of their most popular writing compares to the quality of their less popular writing.</p>\n<p>The potential costs from the article were:</p>\n<p>(i) angering people, and turning them off ideas relating to effective altruism;\u00a0</p>\n<p>(ii) damaging my brand, or the brand of effective altruism.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My impression is that, for a one-off article, these aren\u2019t particularly great costs. Consideration (ii) is the larger concern. There is a real long-run risk of being perceived as a charity skeptic (similar to e.g. Bill Easterly), which suggests I want to strictly limit how many \u2018critical of charity\u2019 pieces I write. I\u2019m even more concerned with associating the brand with poor quality of argument than with the sort of contrarianism that this article might have been perceived as embodying. This provides a reason in favour of writing fewer but more in-depth articles.</p>\n<p>A separate mistake, in my view, is that we should have capitalized more on the success of the article. For example, I could have written a series of articles on the topic, using the opportunity to discuss charity cost-effectiveness in more depth. This would have also mitigated some of the brand-related worries. As noted, my follow-up article was only as popular as my typical article, which I took to be evidence against spending more time on it. However, other articles on the ice bucket challenge also did very well on Quartz, and my follow-up article had a poor title, so I think I put too much weight on that fact.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Overall_Assessment\">Overall Assessment</strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s very difficult to assess how valuable the article was, and whether it was positive or negative in value.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My guess is that the benefits outweigh the costs in this instance. However, I don\u2019t think that I should keep writing similar articles: my hunch is that the marginal costs, in terms of brand damage, of articles like this are either non-diminishing or increasing, whereas the marginal benefits (learning and profile), are decreasing. I do plan on writing more articles for Quartz.com, Vox.com, and other media outlets, however I plan on making them comparatively more rigorous than the article in question. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Lessons_learned\">Lessons learned</strong></p>\n<p>The short-term benefits of media attention are comparatively small but non-negligible.</p>\n<p>Representing the minority view in an ongoing debate seems to be a promising strategy of gaining media attention. \u00a0In an attempt to insure \u201cbalance\u201d, the media give roughly equal weight to all viewpoints, regardless of popularity. \u00a0As a consequence, articles defending minoritarian positions will tend to receive disproportionate media coverage.</p>\n<p>Brand-management is going to be very difficult, because it\u2019s so difficult to predict what will go viral, difficult to predict how people will react, and very difficult to judge what the appropriate level of controversiality is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Future_experiments\">Future experiments</strong></p>\n<p>In the coming months I will experiment by with writing longer and comparatively more rigorous articles on carefully chosen topics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This will greatly increase the time cost of writing articles. How to balance increased quantity with increased quality is difficult to know. Moreover, though developing a personal brand as \u201cthe really reasonable and well-informed guy\u201d would be optimal, it\u2019s highly unclear to me whether this is achievable. There are examples of people who have been successful in this regard (like Nate Silver and Tim Harford), but it\u2019s difficult to generalize from cherry-picked examples. However, it\u2019s worth trying it out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>These articles will be stored up and released around the time of my book launch to help raise the profile of the book and to help boost book sales. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Plans_for_2015\">Plans for 2015</strong></p>\n<p>EA Outreach has hired Goldberg McDuffie Communications to raise the profile of Peter Singer\u2019s book launch in April 2015. \u00a0We have already distributed advanced copies of Peter\u2019s book to over 100 journalists. \u00a0</p>\n<p>In May 2015 Peter Singer will be in the UK for the UK launch of his book and Yale University Press will be working with us to promote Peter\u2019s book here. \u00a0Text Publishing will manage Peter\u2019s Australian book launch and associated media push. \u00a0</p>\n<p>We\u2019re still deciding whether to hire a publicist or marketing firm to help with the launch of my book in August 2015; it\u2019s unclear what the value added will be over my publishers\u2019 own efforts. \u00a0Penguin will be promoting my book in the US, and we have Guardian Faber and CEA publicizing my book in the UK. \u00a0We will be negotiating rights with other countries in the next few months. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>*</span> Given that the money moved per visitor figure <strong>may</strong> be as high as $2.78, and may be even higher, it seems worthwhile to experiment with paying for ads to GiveWell\u2019s site, to see if one can achieve a better than 1:1 return on expenditure.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>

We therefore encourage people to make a long-term commitment through the Pledge to Give, put members in contact with each other, support people to set up in person meet-up groups and run the Giving What We Can Trust, which provides an easy and cost-effective way for people to donate. Using the data we\u2019ve gathered over the five years since we started, <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/impact\">we estimate that</a> we have already moved around $6 to effective charities for every $1 we have spent, and that a realistic estimate of our impact in the long term is closer to $60 going to effective charities for every $1 coming to us.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>This year is going to be an amazing year for effective altruism. The publication of <a href=\"/ea/hg/marketing_effective_altruism_what_can_we_expect/\">four books</a> on the topic mean that more people than ever before will hear about effective giving. It is crucial that that awareness leads to long-term impact. This will be our <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/fundraising-2015\">focus over 2015</a>. We will be capitalising on the increased awareness to set-up and support chapters across the English speaking world and Europe (the main markets of the books). We will increase our one-on-one outreach to encourage people to take the Pledge and continue to keep in close contact with our members to ensure member retention. For more information on our activities and team over 2015, see our latest <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/GivingWhatWeCan-FundraisingProspectus2015.pdf\">Fundraising Prospectus</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span><span>We would like to raise our 2015 budget this spring, in order that we can focus without distractions on our core activities over the rest of the year. In order to have our full budget for 2015, and end the year with 12 months of reserves, we need to raise \u00a3150,000. If you\u2019ve previously donated less than \u00a31,000 to Giving What We Can, this is a fantastic time to give because right now donations over \u00a31,000 from new donors are being matched (up to \u00a35,000 per person and with a total cap of \u00a350,000). Our stretch goal is to raise enough so that we don\u2019t have to do another fundraising round for a year - in order to do that we would need to raise an extra 6 months or reserves, meaning we want to raise a total of \u00a3280,000. You can donate now at our <a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.causevox.com\">CauseVox page</a>. If you have any questions please <a href=\"mailto:michelle.hutchinson@givingwhatwecan.org\">get in touch</a>! </span></span></p></div></div>"},

Also very roughly drafted. <a href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/log-normal-lamentations/\">Cross</a>]</p>\n<p>Normally, things are distributed normally. Human talents may turn out to be one of these things. Some people are lucky enough to find themselves on the right side of these distributions \u2013 smarter than average, better at school, more conscientious, whatever. To them go many spoils \u2013 probably more so now than at any time before, thanks to the information economy.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a common story told about a hotshot student at school whose ego crashes to earth when they go to university and find themselves among a group all as special as they thought they were. The reality might be worse: many of the groups the smart or studious segregate into (physics professors, Harvard undergraduates, doctors) have threshold (or near threshold)-like effects: only those with straight A\u2019s, only those with IQs &gt; X, etc. need apply. This introduces a positive skew to the population: most (and the median) are below the average, brought up by a long tail of the (even more) exceptional. Instead of comforting ourselves at looking at the entire population to which we compare favorably, most of us will look around our peer group and find ourselves in the middle, and having to look a long way up to the best.\u00a0<a title=\"As further bad news, there may be progression of \u2018tiers\u2019 which are progressively more selective, somewhat akin to stacked band-pass filters: even if you were the best maths student at your school, then the best at university, you may still find yourself plonked around median in a positive-skewed population of maths professors \u2013 and if you were an exceptional maths professor, you might find yourself plonked around median in the population of fields medalists. And so on (especially \u2013 see infra \u2013 if the underlying distribution is something scale-free).\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/log-normal-lamentations/#note-241-1\"><span>1</span></a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gregoryjlewisdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/normal.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Yet part of growing up is recognizing there will inevitably be people better than you are \u2013 the more able may be able to buy their egos time, but no more. But that needn\u2019t be so bad: in several fields (such as medicine) it can be genuinely hard to judge \u2018betterness\u2019, and so harder to find exemplars to illuminate your relative mediocrity. Often there are a variety of dimensions to being \u2018better\u2019 at something: although I don\u2019t need to try too hard to find doctors who are better at some aspect of medicine than I (more knowledgeable, kinder, more skilled in communication etc.) it is mercifully rare to find doctors who are better than me in all respects. And often the tails are thin: if you\u2019re around 1 standard deviation above the mean, people many times further from the average than you are will still be extraordinarily rare, even if you had a good stick to compare them to yourself.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Look_at_our_thick_tailed_works__ye_average__and_despair__2\">Look at our thick-tailed works, ye average, and despair!\u00a0<a title=\"I wonder how much this post is a monument to the grasping vaingloriousness of my character\u2026\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/log-normal-lamentations/#note-241-2\"><span>2</span></a></h1>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One nice thing about the EA community is that they tend to be an exceptionally able bunch: I remember being in an \u2018intern house\u2019 that housed the guy who came top in philosophy at Cambridge, the guy who came top in philosophy at Yale, and the guy who came top in philosophy at Princeton \u2013 and although that isn\u2019t a standard sample, we seem to be drawn disproportionately not only from those who went to elite universities, but those who did\u00a0<em>extremely well</em>\u00a0at elite universities.\u00a0<a title=\"Pace: academic performance is not the only (nor the best) measure of ability. But it is a measure, and a fairly germane one for the fairly young population \u2018in\u2019 EA.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/log-normal-lamentations/#note-241-3\"><span>3</span></a>\u00a0This sets the bar very high.</p>\n<p>Many of the \u2018high impact\u2019 activities these high achieving people go into (or aspire to go into) are more extreme than normal(ly distributed): log-normal commonly, but it may often be Pareto. The distribution of income or outcomes from entrepreneurial ventures (and therefore upper-bounds on what can be \u2018earned to give\u2019), the distribution of papers or citations in academia, the impact of direct projects, and (more tenuously) degree of connectivity or importance in social networks or movements would all be examples: a few superstars and \u2018big winners\u2019, but\u00a0<em>orders of magnitude</em>\u00a0smaller returns for the rest.</p>\n<p>Insofar as I have \u2018EA career path\u2019, mine is earning to give: if I were trying to feel good about the good I was doing, my first port of call would be my donations. In sum, I\u2019ve given quite a lot to charity \u2013 ~\u00a315,000 and counting \u2013 which I\u2019m proud of. Yet I\u2019m no banker (or algo-trader) \u2013 those who are really good (or lucky, or both) can end up out of university with higher\u00a0<em>starting</em>\u00a0salaries than my\u00a0<em>peak</em>\u00a0expected salary, and so can give away more than ten times more than I will be able to. I know several of these people, and the running tally of each of their donations is often around ten times my own. If they or others become even more successful in finance, or very rich starting a company, there might be several more orders of magnitude between their giving and mine. My contributions may be little more than a rounding error to their work.</p>\n<h1 id=\"A_shattered_visage\">A shattered visage</h1>\n<p>Earning to give is\u00a0<em>kinder\u00a0</em>to the relatively minor players than other \u2018fields\u2019 of EA activity, as even though Bob\u2019s or Ellie\u2019s donations are far larger, they do not overdetermine my own: that their donations dewormed 1000x children does not make the 1x I dewormed any less valuable. It is unclear whether this applies to other \u2018fields': Suppose I became a researcher working on a malaria vaccine, but this vaccine is discovered by Sally the super scientist and her research group across the world. Suppose also that Sally\u2019s discovery was independent of my own work. Although it might have been\u00a0<em>ex ante</em>extremely valuable for me to work on malaria, its value is vitiated when Sally makes her breakthrough, in the same way a lottery ticket loses value after the draw.</p>\n<p>So there are a few ways an Effective Altruist mindset can depress our egos:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is generally a very able and high achieving group of people, setting the \u2018average\u2019 pretty high.</li>\n<li>\u2018Effective Altruist\u2019 fields tend to be heavy-tailed, so that being merely \u2018average\u2019 (for EAs!) in something like earning to give mean having a\u00a0<em>much</em>\u00a0smaller impact when compared to one of the (relatively common) superstars.</li>\n<li>(Our keenness for quantification makes us particularly inclined towards and able to make these sorts of comparative judgements, ditto the penchant for taking things to be commensurate).</li>\n<li>Many of these fields have \u2018lottery-like\u2019 characteristics where<em>\u00a0ex ante</em>\u00a0and<em>\u00a0ex post</em>value diverge greatly. \u2018Taking a shot\u2019 at being an academic or entrepreneur or politician or leading journalist may be a good bet<em>\u00a0ex ante</em>\u00a0for an EA because the upside is so high even if their chances of success remain low (albeit better than the standard reference class). But if the median outcome is failure, the majority who will fail might find the fact it was a good idea<em>\u00a0ex ante</em>\u00a0of scant consolation \u2013 rewards (and most of the world generally) run\u00a0<em>ex post facto.</em></li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"What_remains_besides\">What remains besides</h1>\n<p>I don\u2019t haven\u2019t found a ready \u2018solution\u2019 for these problems, and I\u2019d guess there isn\u2019t one to be found. We should be sceptical of ideological panaceas that can do no wrong and everything right, and EA is no exception: we should expect it to have\u00a0<em>some</em>\u00a0costs, and perhaps this is one of them. If so, better to accept it rather than defend the implausibly defensible.</p>\n<p>In the same way I could console myself, on confronting a generally better doctor: \u201cSure, they are better at A, and B, and C, \u2026 and Y, but I\u2019m better at Z!\u201d, one could do the same with regards to the axes one\u2019s \u2018EA work\u2019. \u201cSure, Ellie the entrepreneur has given hundreds of times more money to charity, but what\u2019s she like at self-flagellating blog posts, huh?\u201d There\u2019s an incentive to diversify as (combinatorically) it will be less frequent to find someone who strictly dominates you, and although we want to compare across diverse fields, doing so remains difficult. Pablo Stafforini has mentioned elsewhere whether EAs should be \u2018specialising\u2019 more instead of spreading their energies over disparate fields: perhaps this makes that less surprising.\u00a0<a title=\"Although there are other more benign possibilities, given diminishing marginal returns and the lack of people available. As a further aside, I\u2019m wary of arguments/discussions that note bias or self-serving explanations that lie parallel to an opposing point of view (\u201cWe should expect people to be more opposed to my controversial idea than they should be due to status quo and social desirability biases\u201d, etc.) First because there are generally so many candidate biases available they end up pointing in most directions; second because it is unclear whether knowing about or noting biases makes one less biased; and third because generally more progress can be made on object level disagreement than on trying to evaluate the strength and relevance of particular biases.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/log-normal-lamentations/#note-241-4\"><span>4</span></a></p>\n<p>Insofar as people\u2019s self-esteem is tied up with their work as EAs (and, hey, shouldn\u2019t it be, in part?) There perhaps is a balance to be struck between soberly and frankly discussing the outcomes and merits of our actions, and being gentle to avoid hurting our peers by talking down their work. Yes, we would all want to know if what we were doing was near useless (or even net negative), but this should be broken with care.\u00a0<a title=\"Another thing I am wary of is Crocker\u2019s rules: the idea that you unilaterally declare: \u2018don\u2019t worry about being polite with me, just tell it to me straight! I won\u2019t be offended\u2019. Naturally, one should try and separate one\u2019s sense of offense from whatever information was there \u2013 it would be a shame to reject a correct diagnosis of our problems because of how it was said. Yet that is very different from trying to eschew this \u2018social formatting\u2019 altogether: people (myself included) generally find it easier to respond well when people are polite, and I suspect this even applies to those eager to make Crocker\u2019s Rules-esque declarations. We might (especially if we\u2019re involved in the \u2018rationality\u2019 movement) want to overcome petty irrationalities like incorrectly updating on feedback because of an affront to our status or self esteem. Yet although petty, they are surprisingly difficult to budge (if I cloned you 1000 times and \u2018told it straight\u2019 to half, yet made an effort to be polite with the other half, do you think one group would update better?) and part of acknowledging our biases should be an acknowledgement that it is sometimes better to placate them rather than overcome them.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/log-normal-lamentations/#note-241-5\"><span>5</span></a></p>\n<p>\u2018Suck it up\u2019 may be the best strategy. These problems become more acute the more we care about our \u2018status\u2019 in the EA community; the pleasure we derive from not only doing good, but doing more good than our peers; and our desire to be seen as successful. Good though it is for these desires to be sublimated to better ends (far preferable all else equal that rivals choose charitable donations rather than Veblen goods to be the arena of their competition), it would be even better to guard against these desires in the first place.

The startup world </span><span>lionizes </span><span>repeat successes like </span><span>Elon Musk and Steve Jobs </span><span>as evidence that certain people are more skilled at creating new companies than others, yet the academic literature on startups contains </span><span>gems</span><span>\u00a0like</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>Human capital variables have limited impact on startup performance, and the few significant effects are split equally between enhancing and impeding performance</span><sup><a href=\"#ftnt1\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>In this post, I discuss the extent to which startup success depends on things outside of the founders\u2019 control and what to do about it.</span></p>\n<h1 id=\"Part_1__The_necessary_role_of_luck\"><span>Part 1: </span><span>T</span><span>he </span><span>necessary </span><span>role of luck</span></h1>\n<p><a></a></p>\n<p><span>If y</span><span>ou are like me, you've understood that entrepreneurship is more risky than dependent employment, but you've never really thought about why. There's no law which says that entrepreneurship has to be risky, so what's going on? Are VCs just getting together and deciding to pay entrepreneurs based on a dice roll? The answer is: basically, yes.</span></p>\n<p><a></a><span>If a founder leaves a startup, that company is in much more dire straits than if an entry-level employee leaves IBM. This means that startup founders need to signal their commitment to investors much more strongly than entry-level employees do; that signaling usually takes the form of the founder rejecting a salary and instead gambling their finances on the company success.</span><sup><a href=\"#ftnt2\">[2]</a></sup><span>\u00a0Because salaries are much more stable than business values, this means that entrepreneurs are forced by investors to accept higher levels of risk.</span></p>\n<p><span>This is important so I\u2019m going to call it out in very clear terms:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>Entrepreneurship </span><span>must</span><span>\u00a0involve an element o</span><span>f risk</span><span>\u00a0for the founder (i.e. luck). If it didn\u2019t, no one would invest.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"The_Importance_of_Industry_Selection\"><span>The Importance of Industry Selection</span></h1>\n<p><span>The greatest startups seem to create markets out of thin air: no one cared about search until Google and only petty criminals ran non-medallioned taxis before Uber. But in reality Google couldn't have been successful wit</span><span>hout the dot-com boom, nor could Uber have gotten traction if smartphone use was low \u2013 factors completely outside the founders' control.</span></p>\n<p><span>This is true more broadly: studies have found that the strongest predictor of a startup\u2019s success is whether they are in a growth indu</span><span>stry</span><span>, rather than the inherent ability of founders (beyond their ability to select a growth industry).</span><sup><a href=\"#ftnt3\">[3]</a></sup></p>\n<p><span>My favorite example of this is a paper entitled \u201cHow much does industry matter, really?\u201d</span><sup><a href=\"#ftnt4\">[4]</a></sup><span>\u00a0In which the authors performed a linear regression on companies\u2019 profitability </span><span>which included a coefficient for every single company</span><span>\u00a0(i.e</span><span>. it was insanely </span><span>biased towards finding that individual performance matters). This lead to the following conclusions:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Y</span><span>our industry</span><span>\u2019s performance</span><span>\u00a0explain</span><span>s 19% of your compan</span><span>y\u2019s </span><span>performance.</span></li>\n<li><span>Everything else about your company </span><span>combined </span><span>(growth, employees, IP,\u2026) </span><span>explains 32% of performance.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>This means that if you are in a growth industry you can do a lot of things wrong and still end up with a </span><span>better company than an awesome team with </span><span>great traction, ironclad intellectual property and a crystal-clear value proposition</span><span>\u00a0if that second company's industry happens to take a downturn</span><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>This is not to say that all entrepreneurs are created equal, because clearly they are not.

While direct feedback from agencies is pending, the </span><a href=\"http://dc-ea.com/progress-report-independent-cost-benefit-analysis-of-proposed-regulations/\"><span>expected benefits</span></a><span> were large enough to bring the project to </span><a href=\"http://www.eaventures.org/\"><span>Effective Altruism Ventures</span></a><span> for assistance in conducting a full-time experiment. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span><span>On June 1, 2015, Effective Altruism Policy Analytics (EAPA) began operations, attempting to bring non-partisan, cause-neutral improvements to regulatory action in the United States. It works to determine the best practices for creating influential analysis and to turn that knowledge over to effective altruists. EAPA will offer its findings to the community and create guides and information for effective altruists interested in influencing policy. EAPA is staffed full-time by Matthew Gentzel and Emma Atlas, as well as part time by interns and a host of volunteer consultants. EAPA is still growing an even greater network of experts and volunteers interested in beneficially influencing policy. As the experiment proceeds, EAPA will gather feedback and create a foundation for the Effective Altruism movement to exert more political influence in the future.</span><span><br><br></span></p>\n<p><span><br></span><span>Who we are:</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Matthew Gentzel</span><span> spent the first semester of his college education at the United States Air Force Academy, and then transferred to the University of Maryland to major in engineering. Matt first became interested in utilitarianism early on in college and worked on projects with Engineers Without Borders and small start-ups. Matt was introduced to Less Wrong in his junior year of college and helped found Effective Altruism at UMD in the summer before his senior year.</span><span><br><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Emma Atlas </span><span>graduated May 2015 with a Bachelor\u2019s in Government &amp; Politics from the University of Maryland. She worked as an intern in the Maryland General Assembly in Spring 2015 and grew an interest in creating non-partisan effective outcomes. She accepted an offer from Gentzel to help on the project, and began working on the project full-time in June.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Lawrence Roth</span><span> is currently an undergraduate student majoring in Criminology/Criminal Justice with a minor in Geographic Information Systems at the University of Maryland. He has experience in programming, web design, and statistics. Roth was introduced to effective altruism by Gentzel and has attended events with the Effective Altruism Society of DC. He accepted an intern position at EAPA assisting with any research needs that Atlas and Gentzel require.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Matthew Dahlhausen </span><span>is a graduate research assistant in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Maryland and Cluster of Sustainability in the Built Environment (CITY). Matt completed an M.S. (2014) in architectural engineering from the Pennsylvania State University, and graduated cum laude from Dartmouth college with a B.S. (2011) in engineering sciences and B.E. (2011) in environmental engineering. Prior to starting his graduate studies, he served with AmeriCorps as a quality assurance manager for a residential energy retrofit program in Philadelphia.

His job is to produce economic impact analyses of regulations. Richard has worked on the gluten-free labeling rule, the trans fat ban, and the rule on intentional adulteration of food supplies.

Federal agencies are often required to post new or proposed regulations online for the public to review and consider, and agencies must return a response to every comment posted by the public. By reviewing policies available for comment and offering analysis when positive influence can be made, you can have a greater impact than you would just by general voting.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>As a group focused on facilitating the voice of effective altruists in the federal register, EAPA organizes efforts around targeting the places where we can make the biggest impact.

{"date": "16th Jul 2015", "title": "EA-commercials on national TV in Norway - for free!", "author": "Jorgen_Ljones", "num_comments": "12 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><h4 id=\"TL_DR__Norwegian_TV_channels_have_to_send_informational_videos_from_non_profits_instead_of_regular_commercials_4_days_a_year__The_only_important_requirement_is_quality__which_judging_by_the_current_videos__is_set_at_a_reachable_level__We_need_input_and_people_who_can_contribute_with_time__skills_and_or_funding_\">TL;DR: Norwegian TV channels have to send informational videos\u00a0from non-profits\u00a0instead of regular commercials 4 days a year. The only important requirement is quality, which judging by the current videos, is set at a reachable level. We need input and people who can contribute with time, skills and/or funding.</h4>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Background\">Background</strong></p>\n<p>The EA community is growing in Norway and one of the larger project that we are working on is starting a foundation that will promote, inform on and manage tax deductible donations to GW/GWWC recommended charities and meta charities. As a part of the promotional plan we want to make an informational video about effective giving that would spark attention, get people to visit the website and ultimately donate to effective charities. The main goal is to show the video in a 30 second version on national television (see details below), and a longer version (or the same version) could be spread on Facebook ant Twitter using the EA network. This video project is not necessarily dependent upon the rest of the foundation, and could be carried out even if we have to postpone the the foundation due to lack of funding.<br><br>By Norwegian law commercial TV stations are not allowed to send commercials four days a year (Christmas day, Pentecost, Good Friday and Easter). Instead they are required to send, equally in length and frequency, informational videos from non-profit organizations free of charge. We believe that this is a great opportunity for reaching out to a large audience and get valuable attention to effective causes, especially if we manage to create a video that sticks out, favorably without\u00a0pitiful, poor and hungry children (as many of the other videos). The cost in time and money is dependent upon the skills of the persons producing the video and the quality we aim for.<br><br><br><strong>Some ideas of format and content</strong><br><br><em>Here are some examples of informational videos sent by other charities: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_VMHvMtWiY\">Lions Club</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4m-Zq6y_Cc\">ParkinsonNorway</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E32nYAoh0Yk\">Save the Children</a>.</em><br><br>We haven't decided on any core message or framing, so we are totally open for suggestions. However, one of the conditions from the TV-stations is that we cannot directly ask for donations. But we can present a web address and the logo at the end. The time limit is 30 seconds, but as pointed out, we can produce a longer version for using online.<br><br>Since we are new in the game, and most people haven't even heard of the charities we recommend, I think we will benefit from being bold and trying to create some attention by being different. Maybe we even should be provocative and challenging.<br><br>I have little experience with video production, but I imagine that making a computer animated video may be the best format. It's cheaper in equipment costs, more likely that EAs or friends of EAs already got the necessary software and knowledge and it's easier to collaborate over the\u00a0web. I also think that few of the other videos are animated, such that this will stick out. Here are some examples of good animated videos I think of: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFdCzN7RYbw\">The Science of Presuation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0\">How The Economic Machine Works</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrw0Glcmowk\">The Girl Effect</a>\u00a0(or may be more like an infographic like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJoGd84Tiu8\">this</a>).<br><br>This is only some very loose ideas and the conditions we have to follow. Please feel free to build on this, or come up with something completely different. We would really appreciate all input, criticism, tips and ideas.</p>\n<h1 id=\"_What_are_needed_to_carry_this_out_\">\n</h1><p><span>What are needed to carry this out</span></p>\n\n<p>At this stage we need the resources in people, skills and money to be confident that the product would be good enough so that we can start the project. A reasonable goal is for the video to be done one month before Good Friday: the deadline for sending in videos that will be aired the two commercial free days of Easter.<br><br>By resources in people and skills we mean people who want to contribute to the creative process, the production process and/or the editing process. Do you have experience with doing similar projects and want to give us a hand? Just giving some tips or ideas will be valuable as well.<br><br>Given that we may not get people with the appropriate skills to make the video (the production part seems most demanding) who are sufficiently motivated to help without any pay, we'll have to hire someone. We got some names of friends of EAs with the appropriate skillset, but we don't know if they got time or that they are willing to doing it for free. Another aspect is the level of commitment friends of EAs will show for a pro bono project, about a cause that they don't usually are excited about. Then a limited fee could be well spent as it emphasizes that we are serious about this, and it creates a stronger commitment to the project.<br><br>Without having much experience about such projects, we estimate that expenses making the video would amount to:<br><span> </span>13 000 <span> </span>NOK - Paying a skilled producer/animator or two<br><span> </span>1500 <span> </span>NOK - Traveling expenses (Trondheim-Oslo)<br><span> </span>500 <span> </span>NOK - Food and snack for workshops<br><br><em>Sum\u00a0<span> </span>15 000 NOK ($1840)</em><br><br>An eventual surplus, resulting from lower expenses than expected, will be donated to SCI if the donor doesn't have other wishes.<br><br>If you are interested in supporting this video project financially and thus helping us reach hundreds of thousands of Norwegians with a message of effective giving, please send an email to post(at)effektivaltruisme.no.<br><br>If you are interested in supporting or learning more about\u00a0our greater project of starting a foundation, please also send us an email. For the foundation we are also trying <a href=\"http://bidra.no/kampanje/stiftelsen-effekt--mangedoble-din-effekt/64cb8b7e-3751-4888-a4c5-553d7296db35\">crowdfunding</a> and we will apply for funding to EA Ventures.</p>\n<p><br>We hope to hear from you in the comments!<br><br><br>- J\u00f8rgen Lj\u00f8nes<br>Co-president of EA NTNU, Norway</p></div></div>"},

Some people in the UK probably want to donate to a US charity like GiveWell or MIRI. Rather than both donating to foreign charities, we should trade donations so that we can both get tax deductibility / Gift Aid for our donations.</p>\n<p>Trading doesn't have to occur only between matched countries. There's a benefit to trading so long as just one side gets tax deductibility / Gift Aid where it didn't exist before. For example, if a UK donor was going to give to a Spanish charity, and if a US donor was going to give to a UK charity, the UK donor should give to the UK charity to get Gift Aid, while the US donor gives to the Spanish charity (without tax deductibility). Trading like what I just described even works for those in the US who have already donated 50% of their income and so can no longer get tax deductions in the current year from further US donations.</p>\n<p>We should set up a marketplace for trading donations.\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/cc/help_a_canadian_give_with_a_taxdeduction_by/1wv\">According to Tom Ash</a>, trading donations is completely legal.</p>\n<p>I created an extremely low-tech platform for donation trading in this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Wl7T8_mAdM2OWAgoGHOVdVSChkCUd1PXqIYPP2JUII/edit#gid=0\">Google spreadsheet</a>.

I haven't been able to find any existing website for this. I'm not sure if that's because large-scale coordination of donation trading is frowned upon or whether it's just because no one has scooped up this opportunity yet.

{"date": "23rd Sep 2015", "title": "Should we give to SCI or fund research into schistosomiasis?", "author": "Maxdalton", "num_comments": "1 comment", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>I'm cross-posting this from the <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-09-21/should-we-give-sci-or-fund-research-schistosomiasis\">Giving What We Can Blog</a>, because I'd love to hear what people think of this cause area, and in particular I'd appreciate any comments on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jmp1LQEem9E29ynSrqYrkiCsFFMrvyZLPqPl3Itdaak/edit?usp=sharing\">the longer report that I have been working on.</a></em></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>At the moment, one of Giving What We Can\u2019s top recommended charities is the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) which distributes treatments for neglected tropical diseases to endemic regions. This has been demonstrated to be a highly cost-effective intervention, with a seemingly huge impact on people\u2019s lives. It is great to do something that seems so obviously good, and effective.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>However, it may be that there are even cheaper, more effective interventions out there. Perhaps we can discover a vaccine for schistosomiasis, or some insecticide that can disrupt their life cycle once and for all. Such interventions could be cheaper, and more effective, than the existing drugs for schistosomiasis. </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>If so, it might be worth funding research in order to develop these interventions. This one-off cost would open up such great new funding opportunities that it could be even more efficient than giving to SCI, in the long-run. </span><span>It might be worth spending money on research now, that would pay off by having an even bigger impact on people\u2019s lives later on. </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>So to find out how to do the most good, we should consider this other option: </span><span>should we fund medical research?</span></p>\n<h1 id=\"Neglected__important__tractable_\"><span>Neglected, important, tractable?</span></h1>\n<p><span>When selecting a cause you want to find something which is a significant problem (important), which you can have a big impact upon (tractable), and which others have ignored (neglected). This helps to ensure that you have a big impact, and are not duplicating work done by others.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"Neglected\"><span>Neglected</span></h2>\n<p><span>There is an incredible amount of money spent on medical research - billions of dollars per year.</span><span><sup>1</sup></span><span> So how could medical research be neglected?</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Well, when we look at the breakdown of that spending, we find that it is incredibly uneven. Diseases that cause 90% of the disease burden receive less than 10% of the medical research funding, an absurdly low figure.</span><span><sup>2</sup></span><span> And of 1393 drugs developed between 1975 and 1999 only 16 - just over 1% - were targeted at tropical diseases or tuberculosis, despite their significant disease burden. </span><span>The tropical diseases that affect the poorest people in the world receive little funding.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Why? Most of the funding for medical research comes from governments in high-income countries, or from pharmaceutical countries focused on lucrative high-income markets. High-income countries have the money to spend on research, and they spend it on their own problems, whilst low-income countries can\u2019t afford research, despite the massive impact it could have.</span><span>3</span><span> This is just what we see in health more generally: much more is spent per capita in higher-income countries, although a great amount of the disease burden is in lower-income countries.</span><span><sup>4</sup></span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>It therefore seems that tropical diseases are relatively neglected, and for the rest of this post I will focus on these diseases.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"Important\"><span>Important</span></h2>\n<p><span>At first pass, it seems clear that this health research could be very important. It could find vaccines, drugs, diagnostics, and vector controls that could help to bring about the (near-) eradication of diseases that adversely affect millions of lives. But things aren\u2019t quite so simple. </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>It may be that, for some diseases, no more health research is needed. For instance, it may be that, since the interventions against schistosomiasis are so cost-effective, there is no need for a vaccine, and if this is the case, schistosomiasis research is less useful.</span><span><sup>5</sup></span><span> We need to </span><span>focus on the diseases </span><span>for which this is not the case, </span><span>where research is still important</span><span>. It requires specific scientific knowledge to ascertain which diseases are most promising in this respect (something I discuss later).</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>One example of a disease for which a vaccine is needed is HIV. HIV not only has a massive disease burden, but is also a relatively expensive disease to treat, sucking up healthcare funding. Whilst there are some current control methods, like male circumcision and condom use, they are difficult to popularise. Having another tool to block transmission could greatly reduce the disease burden, and save healthcare spending that could be used on other diseases.</span><span> </span><span><sup>6</sup></span></p>\n<h2 id=\"Tractable\"><span>Tractable</span></h2>\n<p><span>Having established that some tropical diseases appear to be both neglected and important, we turn now to find out how tractable research is.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>This can be simplified to asking: </span><span>How much will it cost to produce a new drug or vaccine for this disease? </span><span>This is a difficult question to answer. By its nature, research is the exploration of the unknown, and so we don\u2019t know very much about the new drug or vaccine that will come out at the end of it (if we did, we wouldn\u2019t have to do the research!). This means that we don\u2019t know very much about the type and amount of research needed to get us to that finished product. </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Nevertheless, we can get a reasonable idea by examining past drugs, and seeing how much it cost to develop them. One highly cited study finds that the average cost of developing a new drug is $800m.</span><span><sup>7</sup></span><span> There are some reasons to think that this might underestimate current costs somewhat: for instance, the figure is over 10 years old, and drug development costs appear to rise above inflation.</span><span><sup>8</sup></span><span> The true figure is therefore probably a little higher than this. </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>But it isn\u2019t the average figure we interested in. We know that some diseases are likely to be much more simple than others. </span><span>What is the development cost likely to be for the types of tropical disease that we are interested in?</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Tropical disease research tends to be carried out by public-private partnerships, rather than by the private sector alone. It appears that these partnerships face lower costs, since their charitable purpose allows them to gain donations of equipment, or discounted prices, reducing their costs. Moreover, tropical disease research is often carried out in low-income countries, where trials are less expensive. Finally, fewer clinical trials are needed for the development of some of these drugs. </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>It therefore seems that the out-of-pocket costs of this sort of development may be less than half of the cost of private development, or less than a quarter if you account for the cost of capital, </span><span>perhaps in the region of $150m-$178m</span><span>.</span><span><sup>9</sup></span><span> So </span><span>this sort of research could in general be significantly cheaper than most drug research could be.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>However, it is important to note that this will vary by disease, and that some tropical diseases look particularly difficult to produce drugs for. For instance, HIV is a particularly complex disease, making vaccine development tricky.</span><span><sup>10</sup></span><span> This means that it is expected to cost much more to develop a vaccine for HIV - perhaps more like $15bn-$20bn than $800m.</span><span> </span><span><sup>11</sup></span></p>\n<p><span>In order to truly assess the tractability of research into a specific disease, we need to investigate the particular scientific challenges relating to that disease. Though tropical diseases may be cheap to develop drugs for on average, </span><span>we need to know the scientific challenges that a particular disease poses in order to fully assess tractability</span><span>.</span></p>\n<h1 id=\"Estimating_the_cost_effectiveness_of_medical_research\"><span>Estimating the cost-effectiveness of medical research</span></h1>\n<p><span>In the last section, we saw how much variation there was in neglectedness, importance, and tractability between diseases. We narrowed our focus onto a particularly promising set of diseases: tropical diseases (which are neglected relative to other diseases), that need a new type of treatment (and so are important), and that don\u2019t seem to present particular scientific challenges (so are tractable). Homing in on the right disease is really important. </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>But it is also useful to come up with a rough analysis of the cost-effectiveness of interventions, to see if it is plausible that research into any of these diseases could be better than Giving What We Can\u2019s current top recommended charities.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Giving What We Can\u2019s top charities tend to be able to avert a </span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2014-03-04/measuring-benefits\"><span>DALY</span></a><span> (a disability-adjusted life-year, which is a measure of health) for around $50. When I searched for estimates of the cost-effectiveness of research into tropical diseases, I found estimates ranging from $8-$235/DALY, with most estimates grouped around $10-$100/DALY. Inspecting the biases of these papers, it seems that these papers somewhat overestimate the effectiveness of research. </span><span>The true figure for tropical diseases as a whole could be more like $50-$300/DALY.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>However, </span><span>there is likely to be a great variation in effectiveness between diseases, so these estimates indicate that the very best research could well do better than $50/DALY</span><span>. The right type of research could be the most effective intervention we\u2019ve yet found.</span></p>\n<h1 id=\"How_can_we_find_high_impact_research_\"><span>How can we find high impact research?</span></h1>\n<p><span>Unfortunately, we can\u2019t yet be sure what these best opportunities are. But it is worth doing more research to find out what the best interventions are. We need to answer three questions.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>First, we need to look at the current treatments available for tropical diseases, and the scientific challenges to creating new treatments. This will allow us to </span><span>identify for which diseases research is both important and tractable</span><span>. Detailed scientific knowledge will be needed to answer this question.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Second, we need to </span><span>gain a deeper understanding of the current funding situation, and which types of funding are most promising</span><span>. There are different ways to fund disease research: we can pay people to conduct studies (\u2018push funding\u2019) or offer them prizes when they discover new treatments (\u2018pull funding\u2019). Each of these types of funding has advantages, but each is likely to be especially suited to particular situations. A detailed analysis of how to use these funding mechanisms could help us to maximise impact. </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Finally, we should </span><span>develop better models for cost-effectiveness</span><span>. Many of the cost-effectiveness studies cited above failed to account for certain epidemiological considerations, or considered the average rather than the marginal impact of donations. Fixing these problems would allow us to build more reliable models of cost-effectiveness, which would help us to compare research to other types of intervention. </span></p>\n<h1 id=\"Should_we_fund_research_now_\"><span>Should we fund research now?</span></h1>\n<p><span>That is a research agenda.

Please help us to spread the word far and wide in the academic community!]</em></p>\n<p><strong id=\"An_inspiring_first_recruitment_round\">An inspiring first recruitment round</strong></p>\n<p>CSER has been making excellent progress in building up our research team. Our previous recruitment round was a great success, and we made three exceptional hires. Dr Shahar Avin joined us in September from Google, with a background in the philosophy of science (Cambridge, UK). He is currently fleshing out several potential research projects, which will be refined and finalised following a research visit to FHI later this month. Dr Yang Liu joined us this month from Columbia University, with a background in mathematical logic and philosophical decision theory. Yang will work on problems in decision theory that relate to long-term AI, and will help us to link the excellent work being done at MIRI with relevant expertise and talent within academia. In February 2016, we will be joined by Dr Bonnie Wintle from the Centre of Excellence for Biosecurity Risk Analysis (CEBRA), who will lead our horizon-scanning work in collaboration with Professor Bill Sutherland\u2019s group at Cambridge; among other things, she has worked on IARPA-funded development of automated horizon-scanning tools, and has been involved in the Good Judgement Project.</p>\n<p>We are very grateful for the help of the EA community in spreading the word about these positions, and helping us to secure an exceptionally strong field. Additionally, I have now moved on from FHI to be CSER\u2019s full-time Executive Director, and Huw Price is now 50% funded as CSER\u2019s Academic Director (we share him with Cambridge\u2019s Philosophy Faculty, where he remains Bertrand Russell Chair of Philosophy).</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Four_new_positions_\">Four new positions:</strong></p>\n<p>We\u2019re delighted to announce four new positions at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk; details below. Unlike the previous round, where we invited project proposals from across our areas of interest, in this case we have several specific positions that we need to fill for our three year <em>Managing Extreme Technological Risk</em> project, funded by the Templeton World Charity Foundation; details are provided below. As we are building up our academic brand within a traditional university, we expect to predominantly hire from academia, i.e. academic researchers with (or near to the completion of) PhDs. However, we are open to hiring excellent candidates without candidates but with an equivalent and relevant level of expertise, for example in think tanks, policy settings or industry.</p>\n<p>Three of these positions are in the standard academic postdoc mould, working on specific research projects. I\u2019d like to draw attention to the fourth, the <strong>academic project manager</strong>. For this position, we are looking for someone with the intellectual versatility to engage across our research strands \u2013 someone who can coordinate these projects, synthesise and present our research to a range of audiences including funders, collaborators, policymakers and industry contacts. Additionally, this person will play a key role in developing the centre over the next two years, working with our postdocs and professorial advisors to secure funding, and contributing to our research, media, and policy strategy among other things. I\u2019ve been interviewed in the past (<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2013/02/bringing-it-all-together-high-impact-research-management/\">https://80000hours.org/2013/02/bringing-it-all-together-high-impact-research-management/</a>) about the importance of roles of this nature; right now I see it as our biggest bottleneck, and a position in which an ambitious person could make a huge difference.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"We_need_your_help___again_\">We need your help \u2013 again!</strong></p>\n<p>In some ways, CSER has been the quietest of the existential risk organisations of late \u2013 we\u2019ve mainly been establishing research connections, running lectures and seminars, writing research grants and building relations with policymakers (plus some behind-the scenes involvement with various projects). But we\u2019ve been quite successful in these things, and now face an exciting but daunting level of growth: by next year we aim to have a team of 9-10 postdoctoral researchers here at Cambridge, plus senior professors and other staff. It\u2019s very important we continue our momentum by getting world-class researchers motivated to do work of the highest impact. Reaching out and finding these people is quite a challenge, especially given our still-small team. So the help of the EA community in spreading the word \u2013 on your facebook feeds, on relevant mailing lists in your universities, passing them on to talented people you know \u2013 will make a huge difference to us.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much!</p>\n<p>Se\u00e1n \u00d3 h\u00c9igeartaigh,</p>\n<p>Executive Director, CSER</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Centre for the Study of Existential Risk is delighted to announce\u00a0<strong>four new postdoctoral positions</strong>\u00a0for the subprojects below, to begin in January 2016 or as soon as possible afterwards. The research associates will join a growing team of researchers developing a general methodology for the management of extreme technological risk.</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluation of extreme technological risk</strong>\u00a0will examine issues such as:<br> The use and limitations of approaches such as cost-benefit analysis when evaluating extreme technological risk; the importance of mitigating extreme technological risk compared to other global priorities; issues in population ethics as they relate to future generations; challenges associated with evaluating small probabilities of large payoffs; challenges associated with moral and evaluative uncertainty as they relate to the long-term future of humanity.<br> Relevant disciplines include philosophy and economics, although suitable candidates outside these fields are welcomed.<br> <a href=\"http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/applications/position/view/141\">Evaluation of extreme technological risk</a></p>\n<p><strong>Extreme risk and the culture of science</strong>\u00a0will explore the hypothesis that the culture of science is in some ways ill-adapted to successful long-term management of extreme technological risk, and investigate the option of \u2018tweaking\u2019 scientific practice, so as to improve its suitability for this special task. It will examine topics including inductive risk, use and limitations of the precautionary principle, and the case for scientific pluralism and \u2018breakout thinking\u2019 where extreme technological risk is concerned. Relevant disciplines include philosophy of science and science and technology studies, although suitable candidates outside these fields are welcomed.<br> <a href=\"http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/applications/position/view/142\">Extreme risk and the culture of science</a></p>\n<p><strong>Responsible innovation and extreme technological risk</strong>\u00a0asks what can be done to encourage risk-awareness and societal responsibility, without discouraging innovation, within the communities developing future technologies with transformative potential. What can be learned from historical examples of technology governance and culture-development? What are the roles of different forms of regulation in the development of transformative technologies with risk potential? Relevant disciplines include science and technology studies, geography, sociology, governance, philosophy of science, plus relevant technological fields (e.g., AI, biotechnology, geoengineering), although suitable candidates outside these fields are welcomed.<br> <a href=\"http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/applications/position/view/140\">Responsible innovation and extreme technological risk</a></p>\n<p>We are also seeking to appoint an\u00a0<strong>academic project manager</strong>, who will play a central role in developing CSER into a world-class research centre. We seek an ambitious candidate with initiative and a broad intellectual range for a postdoctoral role combining academic and administrative responsibilities. The Academic Project Manager will co-ordinate and develop CSER\u2019s projects and the Centre\u2019s overall profile, and build and maintain collaborations with academic centres, industry leaders and policy makers in the UK and worldwide. This is a unique opportunity to play a formative research development role in the establishment of a world-class centre.<br> <a href=\"http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/applications/position/view/143\">CSER Academic Project Manager</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Candidates will normally have a PhD in a relevant field or an equivalent level of experience and accomplishment (for example, in a policy, industry, or think tank setting).

{"date": "21st Sep 2015", "title": "Thread for discussing critical review of Doing Good Better in the London Review of Books", "author": "Benjamin_Todd", "num_comments": "20 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><a href=\"http://www.effectivealtruism.com/\">Doing Good Better</a>, an introduction to effective altruism, was <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n18/amia-srinivasan/stop-the-robot-apocalypse\">recently reviewed by Amia Srinivasan in the London Review of Books</a>, Europe's most successful literary magazine.</p>\n<p>The article reads as critical of effective altruism, though is also careful to point out its advantages and our responses.</p>\n<p>Overall, it's some of the most thoughtful criticism of effective altruism from someone outside our community I've seen in some time. Amia made a real effort to understand in our position, and had a lengthy discussion with Will before she published the article. At the same time, Amia clearly has a different world view from most of us, so it can make for frustrating reading.</p>\n<p>Because of this, I think we should make an effort to welcome this feedback and try to learn from it - it'll need to be an active effort because my gut response is defensive!</p>\n<p>To help get us going, in the rest of this post I've taken some key extracts from the article and added my comments.\u00a0</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>A new generation of moral philosophers is determined to break with this tradition of ineffectuality. The goal of the \u2018effective altruists\u2019 is not only to theorise the world, but to use their theories to leave the world a better place than they found it.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The author focuses heavily on effective altruism's roots in moral philosophy, which makes sense in the context of a review of Will's book, but is a bit unfair on the movement overall. The founders of the other organisations mostly don't have backgrounds in academic philosophy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>MacAskill proposes that \u2018good\u2019, here, can be understood roughly in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (Qalys)</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This may be a misunderstanding. Will talks at length about QALYs in the book as one way to compare outcomes, but he doesn't propose that's how to understand \"good\" in general. Rather \"good\" would be understood as the welfare of sentient beings, of which health is just one component.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>[on the negative effects of seeking jobs in finance] Up until recently MacAskill argued that such effects were morally irrelevant</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not that they're irrelevant, just that they're (i) smaller than they look and (ii) permissible in the context of doing a large amount of good through donations.</p>\n<div><br></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>MacAskill is evidently comfortable with ways of talking that are familiar from the exponents of global capitalism: the will to quantify, the essential comparability of all goods and all evils, the obsession with productivity and efficiency, the conviction that there is a happy convergence between self-interest and morality, the seeming confidence that there is no crisis whose solution is beyond the ingenuity of man. He repeatedly talks about philanthropy as a deal too good to pass up: \u2018It\u2019s like a 99 per cent off sale, or buy one, get 99 free. It might be the most amazing deal you\u2019ll see in your life.\u2019 There is a seemingly unanswerable logic, at once natural and magical, simple and totalising, to both global capitalism and effective altruism. That he speaks in the proprietary language of the illness \u2013 global inequality \u2013 whose symptoms he proposes to mop up is an irony on which he doesn\u2019t comment. Perhaps he senses that his potential followers \u2013 privileged, ambitious millennials \u2013 don\u2019t want to hear about the iniquities of the system that has shaped their worldview. Or perhaps he thinks there\u2019s no irony here at all: capitalism, as always, produces the means of its own correction, and effective altruism is just the latest instance.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not really sure what to make of this, maybe something like:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our worldview is inherently biased in favor supporting this existing economic system, because we share many of its key assumptions, which will mean we'll fail to see potentially better ways of improving the world that involve changing the economic system.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>I'm inclined to think you can separate basic ideas in economics (e.g. thinking at the margin) and ideas like the comparability of values from endorsing modern capitalism.\u00a0</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<blockquote>\n<div><span>Yet there is no principled reason why effective altruists should endorse the worldview of the benevolent capitalist. Since effective altruism is committed to whatever would maximise the social good, it might for example turn out to support anti-capitalist revolution....</span></div>\n<span>Indeed one element of the movement is turning its attention towards what members like to call \u2018systemic change\u2019, taking up political advocacy on issues ranging from factory farming to immigration reform.</span></blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yep.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>The more uncertain the figures, the less useful the calculation, and the more we end up relying on a commonsense understanding of what\u2019s worth doing. Do we really need a sophisticated model to tell us that we shouldn\u2019t deal in subprime mortgages, or that the American prison system needs fixing, or that it might be worthwhile going into electoral politics if you can be confident you aren\u2019t doing it solely out of self-interest? The more complex the problem effective altruism tries to address \u2013 that is, the more deeply it engages with the world as a political entity \u2013 the less distinctive its contribution becomes.\u00a0</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this is a good point, which was also made by <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/4/24/8457895/givewell-open-philanthropy-charity\">Dylan Matthews</a>. Nevertheless, even if effective altruism's contribution is smaller than it first looks, it could still be substantial. The changes many effective altruists have made to their lives bears this out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>[Drawing on <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9124145/effective-altruism-global-ai\">Dylan Matthew's Vox piece about EAG</a>] Thus the humanitarian logic of effective altruism leads to the conclusion that more money needs to be spent on computers: why invest in anti-malarial nets when there\u2019s a robot apocalypse to halt? It\u2019s no surprise that effective altruism is popular in Silicon Valley: PayPal founder Peter Thiel, Skype developer Jaan Tallinn and Tesla CEO Elon Musk are all major financial supporters of x-risk research.</span><a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n18/amia-srinivasan/stop-the-robot-apocalypse#fn-asterisk\">\u200b<span>\uff0a</span></a><span>\u00a0Who doesn\u2019t want to believe that their work is of overwhelming humanitarian significance?</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I really don't buy the \"we're all rationalising to ourselves that AI is important\" line. All the people around CEA and GiveWell started focused on global poverty (and US education for GiveWell), and hardly any of us have a background in computer science or technology. We became to support AI safety research after engaging in the arguments for it over a period of years.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>Effective altruism, so far at least, has been a conservative movement, calling us back to where we already are: the world as it is, our institutions as they are. MacAskill does not address the deep sources of global misery \u2013 international trade and finance, debt, nationalism, imperialism, racial and gender-based subordination, war, environmental degradation, corruption, exploitation of labour \u2013 or the forces that ensure its reproduction. Effective altruism doesn\u2019t try to understand how power works, except to better align itself with it. In this sense it leaves everything just as it is. This is no doubt comforting to those who enjoy the status quo \u2013 and may in part account for the movement\u2019s success.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One clarification (that Amia also makes) is that effective altruism is only conservative in the sense of not questioning the existing political system. It's radical in the sense that members of the movement want to promote concern for all sentient beings, think you should give most of your money to charity, want to shape the future through AI and so on.</p>\n<p>What of the criticism? I think there's a couple of ideas here that need different responses:</p>\n<p>1. It's a good point that we should be wary of being biased in favour of actions that preserve the status quo politically. That's the direction we're most likely to be biased in.</p>\n<p>2. I think it's also a good point that many in the community engage with an overly narrow range of causes, and have not yet considered the full range of options for doing good. Though this is beginning to change.</p>\n<p>3. However, I think others in the community have considered working on areas like international trade, debt, nationalism and so on, and trying to cause systemic change, and rejected them.</p>\n<p>In some cases, they might reject that these causes are the most important e.g. many people are highly uncertain what a reformed economic or political system should look like, so think promoting one has unclear value. Other people in the community simply disagree that these are the major causes in suffering the world; rather they might say it's lack of concern for animals, or lack of concern for the long-term future.</p>\n<p>More normally, people in the community would concede these are important causes, but rather think they think they're not unusually tractable or neglected, so not the top priority for action e.g. promoting evidence-based international development seems much more tractable than any of these causes, while existential risks are similarly or more important, but far more neglected.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It seems like Amia simply disagrees with this prioritisation, and thinks we're biased for making it. Moreover, to be fair, none of this is discussed in Will's book beyond the general cause framework.</p>\n<p>Finally, Amia's criticisms are a long way from a positive argument that there's something better we could be working on. Saying that \"nationalism is a problem\" is a long way from knowing what to do about it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>MacAskill tells us that effective altruists \u2013 like utilitarians \u2013 are committed to doing the most good possible, but he also tells us that it\u2019s OK to enjoy a \u2018cushy lifestyle\u2019, so long as you\u2019re donating a lot to charity. Either effective altruism, like utilitarianism, demands that we do the most good possible, or it asks merely that we try to make things better. The first thought is genuinely radical, requiring us to overhaul our daily lives in ways unimaginable to most.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think there may be a misunderstanding here. Effective altruism claims you should try to do the most good *with a significant proportion of your resources* (operationally defined as over 10%). It's not both claiming you should do the most good and merely make things better.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>If you\u2019re faced with the choice between spending a few hours consoling a bereaved friend, or earning some money to donate to an effective charity, the utilitarian calculus will tell you to do the latter.\u00a0</span></p>\n<span>If effective altruists really are committed to doing the most good, they should say the same.</span></blockquote>\n<p>I doubt it.</p>\n<p>Also, EAs are not aiming to be 100% dedicated to helping others, so can deny it even if utilitarians can't.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>MacAskill thinks this self-transcendence \u2013 or as close as we non-saints can get to it \u2013 is essential if we are going to meet the ethical demands of our day. Wittingly or not, he believes, we are all like A&amp;E doctors, forced to perform triage lest more people suffer and die than have to. What is required is impersonal, ruthless decision-making, heart firmly reined in by the head. This is not our everyday sense of the ethical life; such notions as responsibility, kindness, dignity and moral sensitivity will have to be radically reimagined if they are to survive the scrutiny of the universal gaze. But why think this is the right way round? Perhaps it is the universal gaze that cannot withstand our ethical scrutiny.</span>\u00a0</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Clearly we think the everyday notion of an ethical life has to change. But I think effective altruism strikes a good middle ground between complete transformation and existing common sense ethics.\u00a0</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>There is a small paradox in the growth of effective altruism as a movement when it is so profoundly individualistic. Its utilitarian calculations presuppose that everyone else will continue to conduct business as usual; the world is a given, in which one can make careful, piecemeal interventions. The tacit assumption is that the individual, not the community, class or state, is the proper object of moral theorising. There are benefits to thinking this way. If everything comes down to the marginal individual, then our ethical ambitions can be safely circumscribed;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How I read this paragraph is that effective altruists are likely going to miss out on the most important ways to change the world because we'll fail to consider systemic changes because we're overly focused on individual actions at the margin.</p>\n<p>Here's how I think an EA should think about whether to advocate for systemic change:</p>\n<p>1. Value of changed system = V</p>\n<p>2. My probability of bringing about a changed system if I try is P</p>\n<p>3. Expected value of working on changing the system = V * P</p>\n<p>4. Work on changing the system if this value is greater than the next best alternative.</p>\n<p>\u00a0I think Amia's criticism could be interpreted as one of:</p>\n<p>1. EAs will fail to even consider that the value of a changing the system is large, because they only think about what individuals can do.</p>\n<p>2. Because V*P is really hard to calculate, EAs will ignore this possibility in favor of more \"common sense\" and comfortable ways to do good that don't question the political system. This is especially true because we tend to think from the individual's perspective. Actually, pushing for systemic change is the best thing to do.</p>\n<p>3. The value of pushing for a systemic change is low, but it's the right thing to do for non-consequentalist reasons.</p>\n<p>4. The value of pushing for systemic change from an individual point of view is low, but that's because we're in a prisoners dilemma style situation. If we could find a way to coordinate, then it would be better to bring about systemic change.</p>\n<p>What do I think's actually going on in the heads of most effective altruists when they don't work on large-scale systemic change? I think mostly they're just not sure whether the value of a changed system is large or not. The track record of trying to design a new political and economic system seems bad, and it's really hard to avoid unintended consequences. Instead, it seems much more tractable to push for marginal changes. There may be an element of bias in this thinking however.</p>\n<p>I don't think (2) is true - EAs have shown themselves far more willing than most to go for low-probability high-value outcomes, such as in the case of existential risk.</p>\n<p>If (4) turns out to be true, that's the most worrying for the movement, though I could conceive of a version of effective altruism that's much more focused on coordination problems than we are currently.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>What are your thoughts? What are the best criticisms in the piece? What should we do differently?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "4th Aug 2015", "title": "Why Effective Altruists Should Use a Robo-Advisor", "author": "MichaelDickens", "num_comments": "25 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>TL;DR: Go sign up for <a href=\"http://wealthfront.com/\">Wealthfront</a> right now and transfer all your savings into it. If you\u2019re young and/or you plan on donating most of your savings, choose the highest risk tolerance Wealthfront allows.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Investing_Basics\">Investing Basics</h1>\n<p>You probably want to save money for retirement, or some future large purchase like a house. Many effective altruists have money that they want to donate eventually, but want to <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/4e/giving_now_vs_later_a_summary/\">hold onto it for now</a>. What should you do with that money while you\u2019re keeping it?</p>\n<p>The simplest option would be to keep all your money in a savings account at your bank. This way you\u2019re guaranteed not to lose your money, but savings accounts earn hardly any interest. If you\u2019re willing to put your money into some riskier investments, you will probably end up with a lot more money than when you started.</p>\n<p>The two most important investment vehicles are stocks and bonds. You can buy these on your own, but you don\u2019t need to.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Robo_Advisors\">Robo-Advisors</h1>\n<p>There are services like <a href=\"http://wealthfront.com/\">Wealthfront</a>, called <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roboadvisor-roboadviser.asp\">robo-advisors</a>, that manage your money for you automatically. You give the robo-advisor some basic facts about yourself such as your age and how much risk you can tolerate, and it figures out a good way to allocate your money. You deposit your savings and the robo-advisor does the rest\u2013you never have to worry about your savings again. A good robo-advisor invests your money to get the best possible returns for your risk tolerance.</p>\n<p>Both individual and professional investors <a href=\"http://amazon.com/Random-Walk-Down-Wall-Street/dp/0393330338\">rarely outperform the market</a> in the long run, so a robo-advisor like Wealthfront will probably manage your money better than either you or a professional would. Even better, Wealthfront has low fees\u2013far lower than anything you\u2019d get from a human money manager\u2013so you get to keep more of your money.</p>\n<p>When you sign up for Wealthfront, it will give you a short quiz to determine how much risk it thinks you\u2019re willing to take on. The more risk you accept, the higher expected return you can get. Whatever this quiz tells you, it might be smart for you to choose the most aggressive, highest-risk allocation. As Carl Shulman explains in <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers\">\u201cSalary or startup? How do-gooders can gain more from risky careers\u201d</a>, effective altruists can afford to take on more risk than most people. To borrow his example, your tenth Ferrari isn\u2019t as valuable as your first, but with your tenth vaccine, you can vaccinate a tenth kid and do just as much good as with your first vaccine. Most investors are highly risk-averse: not losing money is much more important to them than gaining money. But as effective altruists, we can afford to take risky bets because if we win big, we can do massively more good in the world.</p>\n<p>For the curious, Colby Davis\u2019s <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/kzh/a_guide_to_rational_investing/\">A Guide to Rational Investing</a> explains in more detail why investing on your own or with a (human) advisor is a usually bad idea, and why it\u2019s possible to do better than simply buying a total-market index fund. Wealthfront is likely to outperform a total-market index fund because it puts some of your money into <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergingmarketeconomy.asp\">emerging markets</a>, which probably outperform the U.S. market in the long run.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Why_not_Betterment_\">Why not Betterment?</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.betterment.com/\">Betterment</a> is another popular robo-advisor that offers a similar service to Wealthfront. I slightly prefer Wealthfront, but if you already use Betterment and you don\u2019t want to switch, that\u2019s probably fine. It would be counterproductive to get into a debate about the minor points in favor of one or the other\u2013if you prefer to use Betterment, by all means do so. The main benefits to be had here come from putting your money into a good robo-advisor. After that, it doesn\u2019t matter much which one you pick.</p>\n<p>There are a few other robo-advisors on the market which might be just as good. I haven\u2019t spent much time looking into any others, but I feel comfortable recommending either Betterment or Wealthfront.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Why_not_manage_my_own_basket_of_index_funds_\">Why not manage my own basket of index funds?</h1>\n<p>(If you don\u2019t want to do this, you don\u2019t need to read this section.)</p>\n<p>Actually, if you choose a good asset allocation and stick with it, you can probably get better results managing your own assets than using a robo-advisor. This approach requires more dedication, and you need to have a strong stomach to stick with your strategy even when it performs badly. But if that sounds like you, you might want to pursue this approach instead.</p>\n<p>For nearly risk-neutral investors, even Wealthfront\u2019s highest-risk, highest-return allocation still leaves a lot of room to squeeze out more returns. You could earn considerably more money by putting a larger percentage of your portfolio into high-return assets, and the best way to do this is to manually manage your investments.</p>\n<p>This means buying a basket of index funds with a high weighting in asset classes that have historically outperformed the broad market, which could include small-capitalization stocks, <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valuestock.asp\">value stocks</a>, and emerging market stocks. You should NOT simply buy a total U.S. or total world index fund. This will both perform worse than Wealthfront (because it is not weighted toward high-return asset classes) and have higher risk (because it is less diversified). It might sound like a total world index fund is maximally diversified, and in one sense it is because it holds stocks from every part of the world. But Wealthfront\u2019s asset allocation has better diversification properties because it holds a higher weighting in asset classes that tend to be less correlated with each other.</p>\n<p>I plan on writing a future post with some recommendations for nearly risk-neutral investors who want to manage their own investments. For anyone who wants to learn more now, I recommend William Bernstein\u2019s <a href=\"http://amazon.com/The-Intelligent-Asset-Allocator-Portfolio/dp/0071362363\">The Intelligent Asset Allocator</a>, which lays out which asset classes perform best and how to find a good allocation.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Is_this_just_for_effective_altruists_\">Is this just for effective altruists?</h1>\n<p>No, not really. Most people would be better off if they used a robo-advisor. But it\u2019s particularly important that effective altruists are able to make money on their investments, because it means they will have more money to donate.</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimers: I am not affiliated with Wealthfront; I just think robo-advisors are awesome. I am not a financial advisor and you should use your own judgment when making significant financial decisions.</em></p></div></div>"},

Thinking about these areas also helps me to keep my bearings and to understand how specific ideas fit into the broader picture. For the moment, I think there are three usefully distinct areas of research: technical foresight, strategy, and system design.</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Technical foresight:</strong> by understanding the potential properties of superintelligent machines as precisely and methodically as possible, this work helps us to understand and communicate about the risks we could face. This understanding can be used to inform requirements and options in strategy and system design; can be used to gain support for further research investment and implementation of strategies; and can attract people with high rigor requirements to the field, especially if good methodologies and standards are used for the work.</li>\n<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> it is not yet clear how we as a society can best mitigate the risk of loss of control of superintelligent AI systems; more strategic work is needed on this question. This work can also give us perspective to help steer superintelligence theory and system design work, by clarifying what the most relevant questions in those areas are likely to be. It can also attract resources and people who currently don\u2019t see any way to effectively mitigate risks.</li>\n<li><strong>System design:</strong> system design work\u2019s direct impact comes through enabling us to implement strategies that require particular technical capabilities, such as construction of reliable superintelligent machines or containment of potentially superintelligent machines. This object-level knowledge could be especially impactful if machine superintelligence arrives surprisingly early. System design and engineering research can also inform policy requirements by showing what kinds of options are more or less likely to be feasible, and has been successful in attracting people and resources for further research.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>I\u2019d love to hear any comments from people on this forum on the content and format, and to answer any questions you have on the topic!</div></div></div>"},

Of course, it\u2019s deeply uncertain to what extent our advocacy shaped this result.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"Key_points_from_the_new_DfID_strategy\"><span>Key points from the new DfID strategy</span></h3>\n<p><span>It\u2019s worth recognising that DFID,\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.compareyourcountry.org/oda?cr=12&amp;cr1=oecd&amp;lg=en&amp;page=1\"><span>over the last few years</span></a><span>, has become a true global leader in development. The UK spends more in\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.compareyourcountry.org/oda?page=0&amp;cr=12&amp;cr1=oecd&amp;lg=en\"><span>absolute terms</span></a><span>\u00a0on overseas development than any country except the US. It spends almost twice what any other large country spends in relative terms, 0.7% of GNI. Maintaining that commitment, despite big cuts to other budgets, deserves real recognition and praise.</span></p>\n<p><span>DFID will refocus on crisis response and resilience. This includes some large pots of funding:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>A new \u00a31bn Ross Fund targeting research and development in \u201cvaccines, drugs, diagnostics, treatments and other technologies\u201d to combat \u201cinfectious diseases; diseases of epidemic potential, such as Ebola; neglected tropical diseases which affect over a billion people globally; and drug resistant infections\u201d.</span></li>\n<li><span>A new \u00a31.5bn Global Challenges Fund \u201cto strengthen resilience and response to crisis\u201d. This will include \u201cresearch on challenges like beating antimicrobial resistance and protecting animal and plant health, and emerging viral threats in developing countries\u201d.</span></li>\n<li><span>A new \u00a3500m crisis response fund to allow the government to respond quickly to natural disasters or initial outbreaks of potential pandemics.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>There are opportunity costs associated with the development work DFID is de-prioritising. In net, however, this seems extremely positive. We believe, outlined below, that research into the most dangerous diseases can be far more cost-effective for big funders than direct roll-out of those treatments. Moreover, we believe that the global catastrophic risk posed by pandemics is significant and deserves more attention. This new budget addresses that risk along many axes: increasing disease surveillance, researching new defense strategies, and having money set aside to allow rapid action without dithering.</span></p>\n<p><span>In addition, DFID will be refocusing its aid spending in ways that should improve international stability. We do not have a strong view on whether this is good or not because we lack the relevant expertise. It seems politically attractive, which might make one suspicious, but equally there is\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/copenhagen-consensus-iii/research\"><span>evidence</span></a><span>\u00a0that conflict creates huge opportunity costs. Moreover, we believe that global catastrophic risks are exacerbated by conflict because it prevents international coordination of the sort required to resolve collective action problems, and because it encourages arms races in potentially dangerous technology. As a result, we cautiously welcome this shift.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"Why_we_think_funding_research_rather_than_just_direct_deployment_is_probably_right_for_big_funders1\"><span>Why we think funding research rather than just direct deployment is probably right for big funders<span>1</span></span></h3>\n<p><span>We think it is very difficult to work out robustly whether or not research and development is more cost effective than direct deployment of drugs. What we care about is the marginal ex-ante return on investment (ROI) \u2013 the expected value of the next dollar spent on R&amp;D. We want an estimate of this for both the research case and the direct deployment case.</span></p>\n<p><span>For research into cures and treatments for the diseases that inflict the most suffering, estimates of the ex-ante average ROI (rather than marginal) put number between 10-100 DALYs/$1000.</span><span><span>2</span></span><span>\u00a0(</span><a href=\"https://www.ohe.org/publications/donor-investment-choices-modeling-value-money-investing-product-development-public\"><span>OHE</span></a><span>,\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/doc/books/vaccine/MakingMarkets-complete.pdf\"><span>CGD</span></a><span>,\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.bvgh.org/Portals/0/Reports/2006_10_tb_vaccines,_the_case_for_investment.pdf\"><span>BVGH</span></a><span>,\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.iavi.org/publications/file/74-an-advance-market-commitment-for-aids-vaccines-accelerating-the-response-from-industry\"><span>IAVI</span></a><span>) There are a number of factors omitted from these estimates which may skew them upwards, and some downwards. See (</span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jmp1LQEem9E29ynSrqYrkiCsFFMrvyZLPqPl3Itdaak/edit#\"><span>Dalton, 2015</span></a><span>) for further discussion.</span></p>\n<p><span>In fact, we probably care more about marginal impact than the average impact estimated above, but our own</span><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/estimating-the-cost-effectiveness-of-research-into-neglected-diseases/\"><span>analysis</span></a><span>\u00a0suggests that these numbers are in the same region, with marginal NTD/Big Three ROI is about 14 DALYs/$1000 [1.4,130], but substantially higher for some diseases (malaria being one). This analysis is from first principles and makes some strong assumptions about the nature of the returns, so we wouldn\u2019t use it on its own, but it is a useful piece of confirming evidence.</span></p>\n<p><span>The marginal ex-ante cost-effectiveness of direct deployment is also hard to find. Crucially, we do not just want to compare to the top recommended charities by GiveWell, because actual government development spending is not all at this level. I estimate it using the\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.who.int/choice/costs/CER_levels/en/\"><span>WHO-CHOICE threshold</span></a><span>\u00a0for \u201chighly cost-effective\u201d which is 0.6 DALYs/$1000 in the region with the most demanding threshold (AFRO D).<span>3</span></span><span>\u00a0So research in neglected diseases is likely to be roughly between 15-150x more cost-effective than the threshold the WHO uses for \u201chighly cost effective\u201d in the part of the world where they have the most stringent standards for cost-effectiveness. If we assume that all of DfID interventions are at the level of highly cost-effective then we get a 15-150x improvement by switching to research.</span></p>\n<p><span>In fact, the improvement may well \u00a0be substantially higher:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Much of DfID spending is probably less cost-effective than the highly cost-effective threshold and because of DFID commitments to value-for-money this is likely to be redirected before the best spending.</span></li>\n<li><span>Much DfID spending (and disease burden) is in other regions, with less demanding cost-effectiveness thresholds.</span></li>\n<li><span>The research estimates numbers don\u2019t consider long-term scientific progress.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>On the other hand, there are some reasons why the improvement may be lower:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Research funding may not be adequately targeted at neglected diseases;</span></li>\n<li><span>The amount of funding may be large enough that it is difficult to hire qualified experts.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>As a result, our intuitions are that targeted research is probably between one and three orders of magnitude better than the marginal alternatives.</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"How_good_was_DfID_s_funding_shift_\"><span>How good was DfID\u2019s funding shift?</span></h3>\n<p><span>It\u2019s very hard to tell how good DfID\u2019s move was, and it is certainly possible that the shift might have been net negative. However, if we assume that the benefits of research funding are 10-100 DALY/$1000, the health effect of a \u00a32.5bn investment is 38m to 380m DALYs averted.<span>4</span></span><span>\u00a0Conservatively assuming that this is one order of magnitude better than the alternate spending (we estimated one to three), this means the health effect of DfID moving the funding is around 34m to 340m DALYs averted. The most cost-effective direct charities we know of, such as AMF, have a cost-effectiveness of around 10-20 DALY/$1000. This means that the expected health effect of the DFID shift is equivalent to about $1.5bn \u2013 $30bn donated to AMF-tier-charities (at current levels of cost-effectiveness).</span></p>\n<p>Sebastian Farquhar</p>\n<p>Original article <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/12/new-uk-aid-strategy-prioritising-research-and-crisis-response/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><span>NOTE for individual donors: It is hard to fund cost-effective research as an individual donor. Moreover, because you are able to pick the most effective development charities you can get something like 10-15 DALYs/$1000, which is much closer to being competitive with well-targeted research (it is more than one order of magnitude better than my estimate for public development aid).</span></p>\n<p>1\u00a0<span>The following section is a slightly tidied up version of the notes from our advice to policy-makers.</span></p>\n<p>2\u00a0<span>Throughout I have not adjusted properly for inflation for any of the estimates, which come from times between 2005-2015. The ranges are big enough that inflation adjustments will remain relatively negligible.</span></p>\n<p>3\u00a0<span>The threshold is higher in richer regions because it is based on average per capita GDP, so this represents the most demanding threshold in use. This means that the actual marginal cost-effectiveness is likely to be worse, since much of health spending is in richer parts of the world, and some may not be highly cost-effective.</span></p>\n<p>4\u00a0<span>Using an exchange rate of roughly $1.5=\u00a31 and rounding</span></p></div></div>"},

Prioritisation problems come at  different scales: for individuals, for companies or organisations, for  the world at large. At the Global Priorities Project we\u2019re mostly  interested in the large-scale questions. But we sometimes have something  to say about smaller scale problems, too.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve just tidied and released old research notes (mostly from 2013)  on the personal prioritisation problem of how to value time spent on  different activities. This is primarily of use for individuals making  decisions about how to spend their time, money, and mental energy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We get lots of opportunities  to convert between time and money, and it\u2019s hard to know which ones to  take, since they use up other mental resources. I introduce the neutral  hour as a tool for thinking about how to make these comparisons. A  neutral hour is an hour spent where your mental energy is the same level  at the start and the end. I work through some examples of how to use  this tool, look at implications for some common scenarios, and explore  the theory behind them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There may be benefits for broader prioritisation questions. Since  societies are comprised of individuals, it could help to know how to  value time savings or costs to individuals when performing cost-benefit  analysis on larger projects. And there may be techniques for comparing  between different resources that we could usefully apply in wider  contexts. However we think these benefits are secondary.

Under some types of Singleton, virtually any ethical debate could become a very pressing issue: we want to make sure the right side is preserved and propagated. Maybe it is important to persuade people that animals are morally valuable now so that an AI will care about them (though perhaps <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/CEV.pdf\">CEV</a> obviates the need for this.) Or maybe we need to make sure the future Hegemon cares enough about art so the lightcone isn\u2019t deprived of it.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Value Lock-in could happen even without a Singleton, given some new technologies or memes.

{"date": "11th Sep 2015", "title": "On Values Spreading", "author": "MichaelDickens", "num_comments": "13 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>Note: When I speak of extinction risk in this essay, it refers not just to complete extinction but to any event that collapses civilization to the point where we cannot achieve highly good outcomes for the far future.</em></p>\n<p>There are two major interventions for <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2013/07/17/beckstead-interview/\">shaping the far future</a>: reducing human extinction risk and spreading good values. Although we don\u2019t really know how to reduce human extinction, the problem itself is fairly clear and has seen a lot of discussion among effective altruists. Values spreading is less clear.</p>\n<p>A lot of EA activities could be classified as values spreading, but of very different sorts. Meta-organizations like Giving What We Can and Charity Science try to encourage people to value charity more highly; animal charities like The Humane League and <a href=\"http://www.animal-ethics.org/\">Animal Ethics</a> try to get people to assign greater weight to non-human animals. Many supporters of animal welfare interventions believe that these interventions have a large positive effect on the far future via spreading values that cause people to behave in ways that make the world better.</p>\n<p>I believe that reducing extinction risk has a higher expected value than spreading good values, and there are a number of concerns with values spreading that make me reluctant to support it. This essay lays out my reasoning.</p>\n<p><em>Personal note: In 2014 I directed my entire donations budget to The Humane League, and in 2015 I directed it to Animal Charity Evaluators. At the time, I generally agreed with the arguments that values spreading is the most important intervention. But recently I have considered this claim more carefully and now I am more skeptical, for the reasons outlined below.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"The_Upside_of_Values_Spreading\">The Upside of Values Spreading</h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/values-spreading.html\">\u201cValues Spreading Is Often More Important than Extinction Risk\u201d</a>, Brian Tomasik lays out a mathematical intuition for the claim that values spreading has a much higher impact than preventing extinction risk. If we can slightly increase the probability of creating vastly good outcomes in the far future, this could be higher impact than preventing extinction, since the difference between all-humans-are-dead and business-as-usual is probably smaller than the difference between business-as-usual and everything-is-as-good-as-possible. He also claims that values spreading is easier than preventing extinction risk: the best future would be filling the universe with beings that constantly feel euphoria, but this strikes most people as boring and undesirable, so it\u2019s not a popular belief. Thus, increasing the number of people who hold this belief is relatively easy\u2013if one thousand people believe something, convincing 1% more people is a lot easier than if one million people believe it (because it requires convincing only 10 people rather than 10,000).</p>\n<p>I have some concerns with this line of reasoning, and I generally believe that focusing on preventing extinction risk is more important (although I\u2019m not confident about this conclusion\u2013I believed the opposite about a month before I started writing this). In this essay I lay out some of my concerns and reasons to prefer working on reducing extinction risk over values spreading.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Uncertainty_About_Values_Spreading\">Uncertainty About Values Spreading</h2>\n<p>Brian\u2019s mathematical argument in favor of values spreading over existential risk reduction has no obvious flaws, but it is not robust and its inputs derive from the reader\u2019s intuition rather than empirical evidence about existing values and how easy they are to change. I put weak credence in this argument in particular. I have additional concerns with values spreading efforts in general.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Overconfidence\">Overconfidence</h3>\n<p>In many cases, spreading values is a zero-sum game played against other people spreading different values. (For example, I believe that the best thing to do is to fill the universe with tiny beings experiencing maximum possible happiness, but someone else might think this is a terrible outcome, so we both want to change each other\u2019s mind.) As a general principle, we should be careful about playing zero-sum games rather than reaping gains from cooperation. We should only spread values if we are highly confident that we have the correct values. (I feel sufficiently confident about the fact that (many) non-human animals have value, but not sufficiently confident that we should fill the universe with tiny happy beings.)</p>\n<p>I have reflected carefully on my values and feel fairly strongly about them. I believe I have reflected more carefully about my values than perhaps 99.9% of the population, but that still means there are about 7 million people in the world who have reflected as carefully as I have, and many of them disagree with me. The outside view says that I would probably change my mind about at least some of my values if I had more information, so I should be cautious about spreading them.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sense of values spreading for which this reasoning does not apply. If I want to spread values, I might do that by presenting well-constructed arguments for why my values are important. Even if I\u2019m wrong, I believe it is generally beneficial to produce new good arguments or expose more people to good arguments, presuming those people have sufficiently strong <a href=\"http://squid314.livejournal.com/350090.html\">ability to evaluate arguments</a>. Although I believe this sort of activity is probably beneficial in most cases, that\u2019s a long way from the claim that it\u2019s the best thing to be doing. <sup><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup></p>\n<h3 id=\"Which_values_to_promote_\">Which values to promote?</h3>\n<p>I can think of a few values that are plausibly extremely important for people to hold:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Concern for non-human animals</li>\n<li>Effective altruism</li>\n<li>Utilitarianism</li>\n<li>Rationality</li>\n<li>Cooperation between people with competing goals</li>\n<li>Desire for universal eudaimonia\u2013filling the universe with beings experiencing the greatest possible happiness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Right now a lot of EAs support spreading concern for non-human animals and effective altruism, and utilitarianism is pretty similar in practice to effective altruism (the reason a lot of people (including myself) got into EA is because it\u2019s the logical conclusion of utilitarian ethics). <a href=\"http://rationality.org/\">CFAR</a> and other similar organizations are trying to improve rationality. A lot of people care about spreading cooperation but I don\u2019t know much about efforts to do this and whether any are effective. I don\u2019t know of anyone specifically trying to spread desire for universal eudaimonia.</p>\n<p>Spreading desire for universal eudaimonia is plausibly the best of these, but as far as I know no one is doing this (and it\u2019s not even clear how one would go about doing it). I generally believe that supporting effective object-level charities is more important than spreading effective altruism (this is a non-obvious claim but I don\u2019t want to get into it here\u2013the basic argument is that the best charities probably have much higher impact than the most popular EA charities). Spreading anti-speciesism may be highly valuable, but Brian\u2019s mathematical intuition for the value of spreading desire for eudaimonia works against the case for anti-speciesism: a sufficiently large proportion of people care about animals that increasing this proportion is relatively difficult relative to increasing the proportion of people who share some less common value, like desire for universal eudaimonia.</p>\n<p>For the most part, these different values are not mutually contradictory, so in this sense the fact that it\u2019s not obvious which values to spread does not act as an argument against spreading values.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Value_Shifts\">Value Shifts</h2>\n<p>We have a few reasons to be optimistic that human values are moving in the right direction. Humans have become less violent and more cooperative over time (Steven Pinker has argued this in depth in <em>The Better Angels of Our Nature</em>; Holden discusses it <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/07/08/has-violence-declined-when-large-scale-atrocities-are-systematically-included/\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>In <em>The Expanding Circle</em>, Peter Singer argues that humans\u2019 circles of compassion have expanded over time. In light of this evidence, it appears likely that concern for all sentient beings will eventually become widespread as most people\u2019s circles of compassion expand. (Although some have <a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/The%20Narrowing%20Circle\">disputed</a> Singer\u2019s evidence.)</p>\n<p>In the very long term, values shift due to evolutionary forces, and <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html\">this could be harmful</a>. But for now, values appear to be moving in a positive direction and will probably continue to do so. The evidence here is not very clear-cut and there\u2019s some evidence in the opposite direction, but I\u2019m generally optimistic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Debiasing_people_could_lead_to_correct_values\">Debiasing people could lead to correct values</h3>\n<p>In my experience, when people make non-utilitarian judgments in thought experiments, these judgments almost always arise due to well-understood cognitive biases. If these biases were corrected, they would make utilitarian judgments in most situations.</p>\n<p>A few examples of such situations come to mind. (I\u2019m sure many readers will disagree with my assertion that people\u2019s judgments are wrong in these scenarios. For such readers, you can probably think of an area where you disagree with most people, but you expect most people would agree with you if they had better information or were less biased.)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that I do not expect standard rationality training to fix these errors in judgment. In most cases they would probably require much stronger interventions, such as creating technology to let people feel what it\u2019s like to be a chicken or building an <a href=\"http://www.uky.edu/~mwa229/RobertNozickTheExperienceMachine.pdf\">experience machine</a>. I predict that technology like this will exist in the future. But I nonetheless find it likely that most people will change their minds about these scenarios once they get better information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we make humans capable of experiencing massively more happiness, then anyone who does it should agree that making it happen is super important. And if they don\u2019t then I\u2019m probably wrong about it being important. See Scott Alexander\u2019s <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/28/wirehead-gods-on-lotus-thrones/\">Wirehead Gods on Lotus Thrones</a>. See also <a href=\"http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2625\">SMBC</a>.</li>\n<li>People find the repugnant conclusion repugnant because they are not mentally capable of aggregating small experiences over lots of people; see also <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/kn/torture_vs_dust_specks/\">Torture vs. Dust Specks</a> and its followup <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/n3/circular_altruism/\">Circular Altruism</a>.</li>\n<li>People don\u2019t believe we should give all our resources to a utility monster because they can\u2019t conceive of how amazingly happy a utility monster would be.</li>\n<li>People are negative utilitarians because the worst possible suffering outweighs the best possible happiness in humans (and probably in all sentient animals), but this is likely untrue over the space of all possible minds. If we could modify humans to experience happiness equal to their capacity for suffering, they should choose, for example, 2 seconds of extreme happiness plus 1 second of extreme suffering rather than none of either.</li>\n<li>Intelligent humans frequently discount animals because they believe they cannot suffer (which is factually false) or that higher-order reasoning or self-awareness is what makes suffering morally significant. If we can temporarily remove people\u2019s self-awareness (which may be possible if we can upload humans to computers and then modify their minds), it should become obvious to them that self-awareness is not what makes suffering bad. And if it doesn\u2019t become obvious then I\u2019m probably wrong about that.</li>\n<li>Many people believe that having twice as many happy people is less than twice as good. They probably believe this because their mental algorithms naively apply the principle of diminishing marginal utility even where it is not relevant, and their Systems 1 don\u2019t know that diminishing marginal utility doesn\u2019t work over people.</li>\n<li>At <a href=\"http://www.eaglobal.org/\">EA Global</a>, Joshua Greene gave a talk in which he claimed that drugs that enhance the amygdala response cause people to make more non-utilitarian judgments, and drugs that inhibit it make people more utilitarian. (Talk is available <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYv3Kv8yxhM\">here</a>.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Will_value_shifts_carry_through_to_the_far_future_\">Will value shifts carry through to the far future?</h3>\n<p>Changing values now may not have much effect on values in the far future. Paul Christiano <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/06/13/against-moral-advocacy/\">argues</a> that changes to present-day values should be discounted by an order of magnitude when considering the far future:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think that convincing an additional 10% of the world to share my values would increase the value of the future by less than 1% via it\u2019s [sic] effect on far future values[.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He presents a number of reasons to believe this; I have little to add to his analysis on this point.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Urgency\">Urgency</h2>\n<p>Societal values appear to be fairly malleable and moving in the right direction. Given sufficient time, it seems likely that we will produce highly good outcomes for not just humans but all sentient beings. We could speed up this process or make it more probable, but it feels much less urgent than extinction risk. Civilization has perhaps a <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/gcr-report.pdf\">20% chance</a> of collapsing in the next hundred years; it is critical that we prevent this from happening, and we need to act quickly.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s conceivable that society could end up \u201clocking in\u201d its values at some point in the near future, perhaps by creating a <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/singleton.html\">singleton</a>. In this case it would be urgent to ensure that the singleton has correct values. Probably the best way to do this would be to find plausible mechanisms by which this could happen and then ensure that the singleton has the correct values. For example, if AI researchers will create a superintelligent AI with locked in values that quickly takes control of everything, we have to make sure that the AI <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/WhyWeNeedFriendlyAI.pdf\">has good values</a>. It\u2019s critical to ensure that a superintelligent AI places appropriate value on non-human animals. However, it seems considerably more likely that we will go extinct than that we will get locked in to values that are bad but not bad in a way that kills all humans.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Values_Spreading_as_Cooperation\">Values Spreading as Cooperation</h2>\n<p>Some people (such as <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/06/13/against-moral-advocacy/\">Paul Christiano</a>) frame values spreading as an uncooperative act in which I compete against other moral agents to push my values instead of theirs. But the values that I would actually want to spread don\u2019t seem to fit this. I could of course attempt to spread cooperation itself. But other values I care about count as a sort of cooperation, as well. For example, spreading concern for animals really means getting more people to take actions that benefit animals\u2019 interests. It\u2019s not clear that we can coherently say that chickens <em>value</em> not being tortured on factory farms, but they certainly have an <em>interest</em> in not being tortured. However, chickens cannot be cooperated with in the sense that chickens do not try to spread their values, and perhaps the only sense in which it makes sense to talk about cooperation is with other agents that are trying to spread their own values.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Problems_with_current_efforts\">Problems with current efforts</h2>\n<p>For the sake of brevity, I will only discuss spreading concern for animals in this section. I believe it is probably the most promising values-spreading intervention.</p>\n<p>We can relatively easily observe whether an advocacy organization successfully convinces people to eat less meat or fewer eggs (although even this is tricky). It\u2019s intuitively plausible that when people eat less meat it\u2019s because they care more about nonhuman animals, and they\u2019re likely to propagate forward those values in ways that will benefit animals in the far future. But although this claim is plausible, there\u2019s little actual evidence to support it\u2013it has no advantage over claims about efforts to reduce existential risk. If the biggest benefit of animal advocacy organizations comes from spreading good values, then they need to put more effort into demonstrating that they actually do this. The evidence on this is extremely murky.</p>\n<p>As far as I know, Animal Ethics is the only organization that explicitly tries to spread concern for wild animal suffering, which is by far the biggest source of suffering that currently exists. They are a young organization and I have no idea if they\u2019re succeeding at this goal.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not unfeasible to measure shifts in values for things we care about. But we have a difficult enough time figuring out whether animal charities even reduce meat consumption, much less change people\u2019s fundamental judgments about non-human animals.</p>\n<p>The Open Philanthropy Project plans to <a href=\"http://files.givewell.org/files/open-philanthropy-project/jobs/Factory%20Farming%20Program%20Officer.pdf\">put $5 million per year</a> into reducing factory farming, but it looks like they plan to focus more on having a direct impact on factory-farmed animals rather than spreading concern for animals in general. Activities like this have to take into account <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/vegan-advocacy-and-pessimism-about-wild.html\">the large effects that factory farming has on wild animals</a>: reducing factory farming might actually be harmful for animals in the short run (although Brian Tomasik <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/vegetarianism-and-wild-animals/\">believes</a> (with weak confidence) that it is more likely to be positive than negative), so it is critical that any efforts improve concern for animals in a way that will benefit animals in the far future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How_efforts_could_be_better\">How efforts could be better</h2>\n<p>Probably, some sorts of values spreading matter much, much more than others. Perhaps convincing AI researchers to care more about non-human animals could substantially increase the probability that a superintelligent AI will also care about animals. This could be highly impactful and may even be the most effective thing to do right now. (I am much more willing to consider donating to MIRI now that its executive director values non-human animals.) I don\u2019t see anyone doing this, and if I did, I would want to see evidence that they were doing a good job; but this would plausibly be a highly effective intervention.</p>\n<p>There may be other sorts of targeted values spreading that work well. Veg outreach charities already try to target elite colleges on the premise that students there have more social leverage. You could probably do even better than that by targeting smaller and higher-leverage groups of people.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Both existential risk reduction and long-term values spreading potentially have astronomical impact but have fairly weak evidence supporting their effectiveness. It\u2019s not clear which values we should spread, and if we spread them it\u2019s not clear if they will stick or that they will produce a better world than we should have had anyway.</p>\n<p>Additionally, existential risk reduction acts as a hedge: even if we don\u2019t agree on values, lots of value systems agree that <a href=\"http://mdickens.me/2015/08/15/is_preventing_human_extinction_good/\">preventing extinction is good</a>; and if civilization stays around for longer it gives us more time to find correct values. (It\u2019s not obvious that values are the sort of thing you can deduce through reasoning, but I expect people\u2019s values will often shift in the right direction in response to new knowledge, as explained in \u201cDebiasing people could lead to correct values\u201d above.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/gz/policy_debates_should_not_appear_onesided/\">Policy debates should not appear one-sided</a>; I do believe there are compelling advantages of values spreading over existential risk reduction. Perhaps it\u2019s easier to push values in the right direction than it is to reduce the probability of an extinction event; perhaps the difference between the everyone\u2019s-dead world and the business-as-usual world is smaller than the difference between business-as-usual and everyone-has-perfect-values. But in general I find the concerns with values spreading more significant and more clear, which leads me to the conclusion that supporting existential risk reduction is more important.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Notes\">Notes</h2>\n<!-- LocalWords: EAs CFAR SMBC Christiano MIRI -->\n<div><ol>\n<li>\n<p>Actually, producing arguments on important subjects is probably the best thing to be doing in a lot of cases\u2013it\u2019s what I\u2019m doing as I write this\u2013but it has rapidly diminishing marginal utility. It\u2019s probably valuable for me to spend five hours a week on this, but 40 would be excessive. For some people, like <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/\">Brian Tomasik</a>, who are exceptionally good at producing new and useful arguments, it may be better to do this full time. Producing arguments in this way sounds a lot like doing research. It\u2019s beyond the scope of this essay to discuss whether high-impact research is the best cause to support. <a href=\"#fnref:1\">\u21a9</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div></div>"},

We\u2019ve found that donors find motivation in partnership. Take, for example, one of our fundraisers from last year who has noted he would not have run a fundraiser that earned over $25,000 if not for the match guarantee. It\u2019s symbiosis in action.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Our goal at Charity Science is to harness the momentum that can be achieved through a partnership between donors and matchers. Logistically, this means we must have matchers in place to be the motivators. This is the first line in a dialogue that might go something like this:</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Matcher: \u201cIf you go to the gym, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span>Donor: \u201cAlright, fine.

Let\u2019s all go.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>As the matcher instigates the process, this is where we must begin.

If you\u2019d like to do so, simply </span><a href=\"https://form.jotform.com/52845350830252\"><span>sign up here</span></a><span>. By focusing on global poverty, you\u2019re funneling in money from donors that may otherwise been given to non-EA charities (or no charities at all). Considering the multiplier effect, a strong case can be made that participating in our fundraiser through matching will give you the biggest bang for your buck.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>It\u2019s important to note that this is not merely speculation. Our metric for measuring the success of fundraisers is not simply the amount that\u2019s donated, but the amount that wouldn\u2019t have been donated otherwise. And that success has been substantial. So to ensure this continues, we will be asking donors and matchers where their money </span><span>would have</span><span> gone.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Consider participating in Charity Science\u2019s Christmas fundraiser.

In Judaism, however, practical examples of EA (such as promotion of the GiveWell website) would most likely prove more tractable.</span></li>\n<li><span>Based on interviews conducted, it became clear that informal attempts at outreach have already been attempted.

The commitment of most religions to some notion of altruism (and sometimes effectiveness within altruism), along with the sheer monetary contribution religious giving adds to philanthropy, makes this interaction an important area of study. Though they share many of the same objectives, points of tension between the two are surfacing. This report aims to explore and describe these interactions and tensions between EA and religious giving.</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>In the U.S. alone, 32% of all charitable giving went to religious organisations, totaling almost $115 billion.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn1\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[1]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> In the U.K., Faith-Based Organisations (FBOs) represent 1 in 5 charities, spanning all parts of the humanitarian sector.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn2\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[2]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> With the decline of a Keynesian state in favour of market-led systems, FBOs, like their secular counterparts, are becoming increasingly important in filling funding gaps.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn3\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[3]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> The four largest FBO networks (including organisations such as World Vision and Caritas) have a combined annual income of approximately US$2.5 billion, two-thirds the annual budget of the UK Department for International Development.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn4\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[4]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> In addition, religion plays a particularly central role in social and cultural life in most developing countries.

Initially, this research sought to examine all of the major religions: Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism. It quickly became clear, however, that there was a lack of sufficient data on altruism and non-Western religions. After consideration, I chose the the following factors in deciding which religions to focus on: the existence and strength of evidence-based research, the donating potential of the religion, and the scriptural and practical similarities shared with EA. In addition to sharing numerous similarities with EA, followers of Christianity and Judaism posses great donating potential. Christianity has 2.2 billion followers representing 55% of the world\u2019s wealth.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn6\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[6]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> Though numbering only 14 million, followers of Judaism posses 1.1% of wealth.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn7\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[7]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> I will therefore use a mixture of academic literature, informal online sources, and interviews to examine the current interactions of EA with Christianity and Judaism.

Research demonstrates that religiously affiliated individuals donate more money to charitable causes than secularists.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn10\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[10]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> In Australia, to provide one example, the <em>Giving Australia Report </em>revealed that those with a religion gave an average amount of $460 per year, compared to only $223 per year for those with no religious affiliation.</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>That said, the relationship between religion and <em>secular </em>giving has not conclusively been proven positive.

Charitable giving, one manifestation of practical altruism, is also common to many religious scriptures. In Judaism, \u201ctzedaka\u201d is the idea of donating a certain portion of one\u2019s income to <em>effective </em>charities on a regular basis. The similarities between this notion and core EA principles are startling. Judaism calls on followers to donate 10% of their income, which is the same amount the bedrock EA organisation </span><span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\"><span>Giving What We Can</span></a></span><span> asks its members to pledge towards cost-effective charities. In the Christian context, the work of certain scholars would imply that Christians have no reason to regard effective altruism as incompatible with their religious beliefs. The Protestant academic Eric Gregory underscores the benefits of a Christianity open to empirical research on effective aid. He claims that Christians should pay attention to the best social-scientific and economic literature to make empirical judgments on how to best reduce poverty. Similarly, the Roman Catholic scholar Charles Camosy adds that \u201cPeter Singer and the Roman Catholic Church are stunningly similar when it comes to articulating our duties to the poor\u201d inasmuch as a shared moral obligation to further poverty alleviation is concerned.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn15\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[15]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> There is, for example, a 10% tithe within the Christian church.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn16\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[16]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> John Wesley, who started the Methodist Church in the 18th century, was well known for living very frugally with the aim of donating the vast remainder of his wealth to the poor.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn17\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[17]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Interviews\"><span><span>Interviews</span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span>I anonymously interviewed several members of the EA movement from Christian and Jewish backgrounds. Insights beyond the purely academic or statistical were found, and have very been helpful in shaping some of the key findings of this report. Several stark similarities emerged:</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong><em><span>Christianity:</span></em></strong><em><span> </span></em><span>Christian members of the EA community felt there was significant overlap between the Christian faith and EA. The following represent the most salient points of similarity:</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Community: </span></em><span>Both Christianity and EA share a strong sense of community. In fact, many Christian effective altruist interviewed mentioned that the community aspect of EA lends the movement a religious appearance to some outside of it. Furthermore, in both Christianity and EA, community is leveraged to encourage in-group members to act positively in ways they might not otherwise, not only in terms of donating time and money to good causes, but also with regard to self-improvement measures.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Stewardship:</span></em><span> The notion of stewardship, or the careful and responsible management of resources, is also present in Christianity and EA. In Christianity, the principle of stewardship is the theological belief that humans should take care of the world, and many Christian denominations have high degrees of support for environmental stewardship. For many EAs, being vegetarian or vegan for reasons relating to animal welfare and environmental responsibility is important, and has some semblances with Christian notions of stewardship.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Effectiveness:</span></em><span> One Christian effective altruist studying politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University pointed out that many Christians buy into the \u201cWesleyan\u201d style of Christianity. Those that are formal members of the Wesleyan church amount to approximately half a million, with many more informally subscribing to this style of Christianity.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn18\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[18]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> As was previously discussed, John Wesley significantly limited his expenses so he could donate the remainder of his large salary to poverty alleviation. While not all of EA advocates this approach, it is hard to deny that this approach towards moral living mirrors some key principles of EA, particularly those associated with Singerian lifestyle choices, and with the \u201cearning to give\u201d approach to effective altruism.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Proselytizing:</span></em><span> Members of (some parts of) Christianity and EA often share the desire to propagate their respective belief systems and movements.

Within the Jewish notion of altruism, there are eight levels of giving. Very relevantly to EA, the two highest\u2014or most respected\u2014levels of giving are 1) Giving with a view to helping a person be empowered and independent, and 2) Giving in such a manner that the giver and recipient are unknown to each other. In a host of different ways, these levels of giving prove strikingly compatible with EA. An emblematic EA organisation that embodies the first level of giving within Judaism is GiveDirectly, which has been recommended since 2012 by GiveWell, and provides cash transfers directly to impoverished recipients.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn19\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[19]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> The second level of giving, or that which is anonymous, is a defining characteristic of most EA organisations and philosophy: to give for the purposes of achieving high levels of social impact, rather than for self-aggrandisement or status.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>\u201cThe Life You Can Save\u201d:</span></em><span> A Jewish interviewee noted the similarities between this early EA text by Peter Singer and <em>Ethics of the Fathers, </em>a compilation of ethical teachings and maxims of Rabbis within Judaism.

Positive efforts and outcomes notwithstanding, up until quite recently many Western governments and development agencies have seen religion as being counter-productive to poverty alleviation. Faith and FBOs attract a large degree of controversy, particularly in international development circles. This is particularly salient with regard to FBOs and global health efforts. While a large portion of the literature focuses on scandals within religious health interventions, recent studies have done a better job at impartially examining the substantial volume of healthcare interventions that FBOs have delivered within the developing world, and with positive findings.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn20\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[20]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> Indeed, in the past couple of decades, significant players in the international development sphere\u2014namely the World Bank and United Nations\u2014openly recognized FBOs as critical partners in the future of sustainable development.<sup><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn21\"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[21]</span></sup></a></sup></span></p>\n<p><span>FBOs, as we have seen, possess enormous amounts of capital, and in many cases put this money to impressive use.

For example, according to numerous publications, FBOs can be of poorer quality than their public alternatives, and have weak governance due to managers being hired on their religious beliefs rather than merit.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn32\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[32]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> Also, FBOs that try to champion a particular set of (often perceivably radical) values, or favour the interests of one group of individuals at the cost of others, must also be mentioned as they clash with EA principles of universality. For example, when theology combines with health-service policy (particularly with sexual reproductive health initiatives) negative health effects have been found.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn33\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[33]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> There are conflicts within certain religions when it comes to family planning methods, including contraception and abortion\u2014along with controversy on how to prevent and or provide education on HIV/AIDS. These health initiatives are practically relevant to the jurisdiction of EA, as they are often associated with global poverty alleviation efforts. The effective altruism movement is significantly based on principles of equality and evidence, so the following concerns present the biggest points of policy (rather than ideological) tension with regards to religion and EA in global health and poverty alleviation. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Sexual_Reproductive_Health\"><span><span>Sexual Reproductive Health</span></span></strong></p>\n<p><em><span>Contraceptive measures and abortion </span></em></p>\n<p><span>One serious consideration when examining the tensions between EA and religiosity involves views on family planning and sexual reproductive health.

Islam is divided\u2014with a minority arguing categorically against contraception but the majority permitting condoms and oral contraceptives. Judaism allows oral contraceptives and intrauterine devices; condoms are prohibited.<sup><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn34\"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[34]</span></sup></a></sup></span></p>\n<p><span>Based largely on varying views of when human life begins, different religions have different beliefs on abortion.

In Judaism, some rabbis accept abortion before 40 days of gestation for serious abnormalities, or for preservation of maternal life. <a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn35\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[35]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em><span>HIV/AIDS</span></em></p>\n<p><span>The first cases of AIDS were reported in the early 1980s. In the three and a half decades since, infections with HIV have grown to pandemic proportions, resulting in 65 million infections and 25 million deaths. HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects countries that already suffer from extreme poverty (namely, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Caribbean), and so has been a primary concern in extreme poverty alleviation of the past few decades. Although such concerns have been well publicized, it is important to mention that the ways in which certain religious groups (and particularly those that identify with Christianity) have dealt with the HIV/AIDS pandemic have been controversial. Failure to acknowledge the disease, along with taking a stance against condoms, and alienating those carrying the disease, have been among the more counter-productive strategies used by some Christian groups. In recent years, however, far more responsible and helpful programs have been initiated by FBOs, which will be further elaborated on later in this report.<sup><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn36\"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[36]</span></sup></a></sup></span></p>\n<p><span><sup><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn36\"><sup></sup></a></sup></span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Sexuality</span></em></p>\n<p><span>An area of significant controversy, inasmuch as religion is concerned, is homosexuality.

In speaking with a member of the Christian EA community, I discovered that within charitable giving three predominant forms of giving exist: contributions to direct suffering (global poverty), contributions to local churches, and contributions to missionary organisations. The latter two of these categories are quite hard to justify in terms of effectiveness or maximization, principles key to EA. This also poses difficulties inasmuch as cannibilisation of funds is concerned. A Christian effective altruist (an individual that is quite prominent within the business community) interviewed underscored the fact that missionary organisations, both in mandate and operations, directly contradict the effectiveness principles of EA. He pointed to the fact that within most missionary organisations, there is no impact for dollar analysis, and that management and staffing decisions in </span><span><a href=\"http://www.500000churches.com/\"><span>such organisations</span></a></span><span> are often nepotistic and religiously-driven rather than based on any notion of merit.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Biases towards funding Christian charities: </span></em><span>Statistically,<em> </em>Christians prefer Christian charities, such as \u201cTearFund,\u201d that use local churches to distribute services, but which might be marginally less effective than EA charities such as the Against Malaria Foundation. It is uncertain whether this is because Christians strongly believe that Christian charities are more effective in distributing aid, or if this is just done on a basis of habit, an important point of future inquiry for outreach purposes.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Philosophical differences: </span></em><span>Many philosophical differences exist between EA and different forms of Christianity. Firstly, Christians interviewed felt that the EA commitment to a consequentialist or utilitarian philosophy was in many ways incompatible with Christian values, and would lead to outcomes that many Christians would not support. Indeed, one Christian effective altruist interviewed thought that certain EA principles such as <em>earning to give</em> may be seen as instrumentalizing people. Further, the rationalist component of EA might turn Christians away as commitment to faith and belief may not have such firmly rational (but instead emotional) underpinnings. Lastly, it was mentioned that the more extreme proponents of EA (such as Peter Singer) may offend some Christians, particularly regarding arguments relating to sentience\u2014and by association, abortion or infanticide.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Eschatology: </span></em><span>Although <em>some</em> tenants of EA (and particularly regarding AI) and Christianity hold in common the notion of Eschatology (or the study of \u201cthe end of things\u201d), this seems to be a point of tension rather than agreement. Some Christians interviewed (as well as those on online forums)<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn38\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[38]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> found it personally insulting that EA focused on AI risk\u2014which many view as a fringe concern\u2014while dismissing the conviction of divine existence that roughly 84% of the world hold. Though sharing some superficial similarities, the concept of AI ending human existence is counter to much scriptural belief in a divine creator. While this may not be considered significant for EA research, it is nonetheless important to note as something the EA movement should be mindful of in approaching religious groups. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Judaism_\"><span>Judaism:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>Judaism arguably has the most significant overlap with principles of effective altruism. That said, some tensions do nonetheless arise. Again, these must be carefully considered for any future outreach initiatives.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Cause prioritisation: </span></em><span>One Jewish EA interviewed said that within the Jewish notion of charity, some prioritisation was at odds with those within EA. Like Christianity, Judaism teaches that one should work to improve themselves first, their family and local community second, and finally the rest of the world. EA, contrastingly, prioritises extreme poverty alleviation, existential risk to humanity, and animal welfare. These convictions are conveyed rather aggressively by certain effective altruist, which might not bode well for future attempts at partnership. Jewish effective altruist interviewed also mentioned that causes such as AI risk or animal welfare weren\u2019t particularly important to Jewish ideas regarding charity. In conversations with Jewish EA communities, rhetoric surrounding the validity (or lack thereof) of cause prioritisation within local humanitarian efforts, community development, animal welfare, or existential risk to humanity should be tempered by a respect for other worldviews.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Philosophy:</span></em><span> As with Christianity, Jewish principles clash with EA\u2019s philosophical inclination towards rationality. Explicitly, a Jewish effective altruist mentioned that the emphasis on one\u2019s \u201crelationship with god\u201d within Judaism contradicts with more rationalist tenets of EA. As with issues regarding cause prioritisation, this does not exclude any potential for future partnership, but rather serves as a consideration of which EAs must be respectful of in future interactions.</span></p>\n<p><span>As has become clear, the interactions between EA and religion are not without tension, and any future attempts at outreach must be mindful of this. There are tensions specific to each religion, but also those that might pose difficulties for religion in general. Most notably, EA may be perceived as being in competition with religion: for charitable funds, and for belief systems. Indeed, as many regard EA as something of an \u201cnon-denominational religion\u201d, religious groups may believe that EA could draw people away from religious devotion and towards a more EA-oriented lifestyle.

Conclusion: given the said overlap and tension, what are the next steps for the EA movement\u2014with its approach to religion\u2014if any?</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>After having explored theological principles and philanthropic actions that are common to both EA and some of the world\u2019s major faiths, it is now possible to comment on a collaborative future that might exist between these groups. Given the significant conceptual overlap present, along with the sheer monetary might of the examined religions, there is significant potential for partnership between EA and religion. Moreover, the future of religious philanthropy seems, for several reasons, to be very secure\u2014potentially more so than secular philanthropy. Throughout the last recession, religious groups fared far better than other charities. Between 2007 and 2009, donations to FBOs declined a mere 0.1 % in the U.S. Secular charities, however, suffered a decline of 10 % or more during this same period.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn39\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[39]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> Furthermore, FBOs and church goers, as can be seen by the giving trend infographics below, are recorded as having steadily rising (rather than declining) levels of giving and growth\u2014significantly more than groups of any other nature in the charitable space. These factors combined make religion a very important point of future inquiry for EA groups. This report has found that, at present, the greatest current potential lies with the religions of Christianity and Judaism. Now, I will draw on findings to provide some suggestions for potential \u201cnext steps\u201d that could shape future interactions between religion and EA. As with previous sections, these recommendations will use a mixture of academic research, informal online resources, and interviews to provide suggestions.</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Christianity__\"><span><span>Christianity: </span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span>Due to the significant amounts of money held in FBOs, churches, and religious individuals themselves\u2014in addition to its commitment to principles common to EA\u2014Christianity is likely the most important religion to consider for future outreach. One Christian effective altruists interviewed was the President at a social justice organisation at The University of Oxford; the interviewee mentioned that when principles of EA were discussed, they were relatively popularly received. Some Christian effective altruists have stated that EA aligns well with their religious views of charity, potentially more so than charitable religious efforts themselves (or the superficial lip service paid to them). Christians have centuries-old practises which facilitate the daily practise of altruism that EA calls for and, if leveraged properly, could be very beneficial to the EA movement. This individual also thought that if EA could capture large Christian audiences the impact would be considerable as Christians are already primed for <em>radical </em>giving. As we have seen, religious individuals are far more generous than their secular counterparts, with religious giving in the U.S. exceeding secular giving by roughly $500 per capita per annum.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn40\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[40]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> At present, however, there is limited official partnership between Christianity and EA; </span><span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/925508180838873/\"><span>merely (mostly online) embryonic attempts at wedding elements of the two communitie</span></a></span><span>s. At this stage, it would also be important to note that the age of the Christian individual in question would probably cause their giving patterns to dramatically differ. The older the individual, the more likely they will be to give to organisations beyond their congregation. For example, in the U.S., 94% of Christians over the age of 65 who donate to their church will also give to other groups.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn41\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[41]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> This finding demonstrates another significant outreach challenge for EA: the need to connect with an older audience for maximal impact (effective altruists are typically young).</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>There is a </span><span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/741228169272427/?fref=ts\"><span>Facebook group</span></a></span><span> for Christian effective altruists that has around 80 members, but isn\u2019t hugely participative or proactive beyond the online discussion space. The Christian effective altruists interviewed thought that a more formal community beyond Facebook was needed to promote EA ideas to the wider Christian community. Indeed, those interviewed consistently stated that, in order to broach the Christian community, trusted and prominent spokespeople from the church (such as pastors or vicars) were needed. These individuals could act as key movement builders by capitalizing on their access to large segments of Christianity. This is important as secular effective altruists may not be the best people to appeal to a Christian audience. Christian effective altruists will know the best tactics, and sensibilities of their church or congregation, so must be identified and tapped into. This idea in particular differed from other religions so is important to flag as a potential strategy specific to Christianity. Other outreach strategies that were offered up by those interviewed could include: developing a presence in the Christian media, writing a text for Christian effective altruists that introduces key EA principles, or locating high-profile individuals that have a link to both Christianity and EA. Such individuals could be Christians billionaires that have taken the </span><span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giving_Pledge\"><span>Giving Pledge</span></a></span><span>, or individuals such as Alex Foster, Paul Niehaus, Charles Camosy, Bruce Wydick or Leah Libresco who have a prominent link to both EA and Christianity. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>In drawing upon resources other than interviews, one study conducted by Princeton University scholars has proved particularly useful. This study reviewed other academic works that explored the importance of various factors surrounding community in determining individual levels of religious philanthropy within Christianity.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn42\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[42]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> Some insights found demonstrate mere similarities with EA; others present future learning opportunities, along with movement building potential. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Notably, in Christianity, stronger social connection with the Church appears to engender more donations, and specifically <em>to organisations working to combat international poverty</em>. Indeed, Putnam and Campbell (2010) found that the number of close friends in the congregation is also a significant predictor of giving internationally. Having more close friends at church and belonging to a small group within the congregation were both associated with higher overall charitable giving. Holding other factors equal, each additional close friend in the congregation is associated with 1.6 percent greater odds of making a donation to international causes.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn43\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[43]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> This provides further evidence for strengthening the EA movement, and promoting strong friendships with EA groups; as within religious groups, such strong bonds implicate higher levels of giving. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>These studies also found that heightened levels of religious philanthropy within Christianity are often linked with higher rates of \u201cexposure to need\u201d, or increased exposure to issues that deserve funding. Churchgoers were found to be more likely to give when they were presented with specific information about the conditions where assistance was needed.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn44\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[44]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> This framing of needs was found particularly important for international causes, because churchgoers tend to have limited personal knowledge of development issues. This mirrors a lot of the knowledge and informational components within EA communities, too. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Another particularly interesting insight was that international causes within Christianity entailed higher levels of giving when congregations had higher percentages of immigrants. These studies demonstrated that immigrants within Western congregations often serve as visible links to a generalized, impoverished part of the world that might otherwise be neglected. In thinking about recommendations, this evidence could be interpreted in two ways. Firstly, to aim to sensitize religious congregations to the importance of having members from the immigrant community, and to leverage in-group benefits that EA may not be able to do with other target groups. Or secondly, that given the \u201c</span><span><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9124145/effective-altruism-global-ai\"><span>male and pale</span></a></span><span>\u201d reputation EA holds, EA should actively try to make itself more ethnically diverse as this might also increase donations from members. This latter suggestion is not widely discussed in EA circles, but is nonetheless worth stating. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>As a report in the Nonprofit Times argued, a practical outreach strategy that could be useful in Christian congregations would be to run courses in personal financial planning and charitable giving in Christian churches. Indeed, in the U.S., <span>only about one-third of congregations offer courses, workshops classes or seminars on personal finance or charitable giving.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftn45\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[45]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> </span>This could happen alongside EA sensitization programs, and could quite possibly lead to a spike in EA giving from Christian groups.</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>These strategies could certainly prove useful in shaping methods of outreach to Christian groups, but must be considered in line with challenges posed to the EA movement. The adaptation, watering down or radicalizing of EA in order to allow compatibility with Christianity must be strongly considered before any formal outreach strategies implemented. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Judaism_1\"><span><span>Judaism:</span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span>Judaism is a religion that shares a significant amount of overlap with EA, and whose members seem sympathetic to its mandate, warranting an exploration of next steps in EA outreach. In previous sections of this research, we have seen that Judaism scripturally aligns well with certain parts of EA. In particular, effectiveness, inasmuch as charity is concerned, was a shared priority. That said, to deny current tensions between EA and Judaism would be detrimental to any next steps in future attempts at outreach. As with Christianity, some elements of cause prioritisation (namely, AI and, to a lesser extent, animal welfare) along with some of the philosophical positions promoted by effective altruist (namely, utilitarianism and rationalism) may be unpopular with some in the Jewish community. As such, it is not necessary to change EA to appeal to a potential religious audience; rather, to emphasize points of similarity, and be respectful with points of difference.</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>One Jewish effective altruist suggested two points of consideration for future partnerships.</span></p>\n<p><span>Firstly, it was mentioned that formally presenting EA ideas to Jewish communities may have a positive uptake (the idea of a Jewish EA handbook was suggested). This individual emphasized, however, that the \u201csocial movement\u201d aspect of EA should not be the first contact a Jewish audience has with the philosophy. Rather, it was emphasized that something practical, evidently impactful, and tangible such as </span><span><a href=\"http://h/\"><span>GiveWel</span></a></span><span>l</span><span> or examples of other effective charities should be promoted. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong id=\"Concluding_remarks_\"><span><span>Concluding remarks:</span></span></strong></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>The forces of interaction between religion and EA are numerous, complex, and certainly worthy of further consideration, research, and action from EA organisations. A point of personal reflection could provide an interesting analogy on the complexity of such interactions, and the need to further add to this research and organisational policy making. Upon receiving this research project, one thing seemed clear to me: the fact that the interactions between EA and the different religions of the world would be largely negative. Potential attempts at partnership would be closed off by tensions, rather than opened up by similarities; ideological differences could only be divisive. However, preliminary reading quickly demonstrated the opposite. I soon discovered that EA and the main religions of the world share many similarities\u2014both in the characteristics of the respective belief systems, and also in many charitable mandates they hold. For reasons relating to the strength of the pre-existing research available, and the religions that could yield the highest impact if properly sensitized to the EA movement, Christianity and Judaism were chosen as the two primary religions to examine. Theologically, both share many similarities with EA. Altruism, effective charity and community are concepts found in Christian and Jewish scriptures and practises alike. Faith-based charitable efforts undertaken by Christian and Jewish FBOs were examined, and positive findings relating to the effectiveness, scope and universalism of such initiatives were established. There were, however, several points of tension between religion and EA. These tensions do not appear to undermine the potential of future attempts at partnership. Rather, they would highlight issues of ideological tension, issues upon which to <em>not </em>devise outreach attempts, and aspects of EA that may prove off-putting to those from a different philosophical belief system. Precise ideas relating to specific outreach strategies that EA could pursue with regard to Christianity and Judaism respectively were explored fully in the body of the research. Some recommendations involved identifying top movement builders within the two religions; others involved describing aspects of EA that could prove insulting or off-putting to religious followers. In concluding, however, two things become clear. Firstly, given the similarities between religion and EA, effective outreach strategies can be developed and implemented. Secondly, if effective, these efforts could prove highly impactful on EA central cause: the alleviation of extreme global poverty. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>\u00a0</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<div><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><br> \n<hr>\n<!--[endif]-->\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftnref1\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[1]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a><span> </span><span>Charitable Giving Statistics, National Philanthropic Trust, </span><a href=\"http://www.nptrust.org/philanthropic-resources/charitable-giving-statistics/\"><span>http://www.nptrust.org/philanthropic-resources/charitable-giving-statistics/</span></a><span> </span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Sophie/Downloads/310815.EffectiveAltruismandReligiousFaithsMutuallyExclusiveEntitiesoranImportantNexustoExplore.docx#_ftnref2\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[2]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a><span> </span><span>Hargrave, R.

Where do these numbers come from? How are they calculated? And how do they relate to each other?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>These numbers are based on a calculation from Givewell\u2019s review of the Against Malaria Foundation<sup><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGpMix0NbN1R2Fr6__wC1G6LigJbNAigk-vnYyFBBcw/pub#ftnt1\">[1]</a></sup>.\u00a0Givewell caveats that these estimates should be used with caution due to significant uncertainty around them, but that it is useful for comparative purposes and to \u201cthink through as many of the relevant issues as possible\u201d<sup><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGpMix0NbN1R2Fr6__wC1G6LigJbNAigk-vnYyFBBcw/pub#ftnt2\">[2]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Givewell\u2019s spreadsheet<sup><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGpMix0NbN1R2Fr6__wC1G6LigJbNAigk-vnYyFBBcw/pub#ftnt3\">[3]</a></sup>\u00a0shows that they take the average overall costs for bednet distributions by AMF and divide them by the expected lives saved / death averted \u201cper protected child under 5\u00a0\u2013\u00a0adjusted for today's lower rates of child mortality and insecticide resistance\u201d. The later estimate also takes into account factors such as wastage, years of protection per person per net, and pre-existing net ownership. This calculation gives us the $3,340 per life saved / deaths averted figure.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But where does the $100 per DALY averted figure come from? And why does it cost $3,340 to avert a death of an 5-year-old child, which has a life expectancy of ~80 years, but ~$100 to enable a year of health life? Shouldn\u2019t it be ~$40 per DALY averted (i.e. $3340 /\u00a080 years)?\u00a0<span>The answer is that the $</span><span>100</span><span>\u00a0figure per DALY averted is time discounted at 3%.\u00a0</span>If one were to not time discount then it would indeed only be ~$40 per DALY averted. But if one time discounts ~80 DALYs at 3%, then they become ~30 DALYs (see\u00a0<sup><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGpMix0NbN1R2Fr6__wC1G6LigJbNAigk-vnYyFBBcw/pub#ftnt4\">[4]</a></sup>\u00a0for the conversion table used and\u00a0<sup><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGpMix0NbN1R2Fr6__wC1G6LigJbNAigk-vnYyFBBcw/pub#ftnt5\">[5]</a></sup>\u00a0to read more about time discounting). You might have noticed that 30*100 is $3000 and not $3,340. This is because the average DALY averted figure used is actually ~$112.5 (in Malawi it\u2019s $98 per DALY averted, whereas in the DRC it\u2019s $125 per DALY averted). 112.5*30 = 3375,\u00a0which is pretty much the\u00a0stated $3,340,\u00a0with the discrepancy being due to rounding errors.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, these figures are similar to\u00a0the one published in a recent\u00a0<span>Lancet\u00a0</span>article<sup><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGpMix0NbN1R2Fr6__wC1G6LigJbNAigk-vnYyFBBcw/pub#ftnt6\">[6]</a></sup>, which estimates that, in low-income countries, to save a child's life, the cost is US$4205.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGpMix0NbN1R2Fr6__wC1G6LigJbNAigk-vnYyFBBcw/pub#ftnt_ref1\">[1]</a><span>\u00a0\"Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) | GiveWell.\" 2010. 13 Jul. 2015 &lt;</span><span><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.givewell.org%2Finternational%2Ftop-charities%2FAMF%23Costperlifesaved&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFuJath2O3m-UhklSNStp8Z2miuXA\">http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Costperlifesaved</a></span><span>&gt;</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGpMix0NbN1R2Fr6__wC1G6LigJbNAigk-vnYyFBBcw/pub#ftnt_ref2\">[2]</a><span>\u00a0\"Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) | GiveWell.\" 2010. 13 Jul. 2015 &lt;</span><span><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.givewell.org%2Finternational%2Ftop-charities%2FAMF%23Costperlifesaved&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFuJath2O3m-UhklSNStp8Z2miuXA\">http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Costperlifesaved</a></span><span>&gt;</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGpMix0NbN1R2Fr6__wC1G6LigJbNAigk-vnYyFBBcw/pub#ftnt_ref3\">[3]</a><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.givewell.org%2Finternational%2Ftop-charities%2FAMF%23footnote81_jlayyrw&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQ-ujGgY2sZSqnH3wtOmSszdFpqw\">http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#footnote81_jlayyrw</a></span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGpMix0NbN1R2Fr6__wC1G6LigJbNAigk-vnYyFBBcw/pub#ftnt_ref4\">[4]</a><span>\u00a0See Lopez et al. 2006, Table 5.1, Pg 402\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww-wds.worldbank.org%2Fexternal%2Fdefault%2FWDSContentServer%2FWDSP%2FIB%2F2006%2F06%2F06%2F000160016_20060606163437%2FRendered%2FPDF%2F364010PAPER0Gl101OFFICIAL0USE0ONLY1.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZdQgolJP9FGtkxNtfdjaOvd7v_Q\">http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/06/06/000160016_20060606163437/Rendered/PDF/364010PAPER0Gl101OFFICIAL0USE0ONLY1.pdf</a></span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGpMix0NbN1R2Fr6__wC1G6LigJbNAigk-vnYyFBBcw/pub#ftnt_ref5\">[5]</a><span>\u00a0Ord, Toby, and Robert Wiblin. \"Should we discount future health benefits when considering cost-effectiveness?.\"</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGpMix0NbN1R2Fr6__wC1G6LigJbNAigk-vnYyFBBcw/pub#ftnt_ref6\">[6]</a><span>\u00a0\"Keeping score: fostering accountability for children's lives ...\" 2015. 13 Jul. 2015 &lt;</span><span><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flancet%2Farticle%2FPIIS0140-6736(15)61171-0%2Ffulltext%3Frss%3Dyes&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFjp3faX7DovfEl6JemegAct3gCcQ\">http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)61171-0/fulltext?rss=yes</a></span><span>&gt;</span></p>\n</div></div></div>"},
{"date": "19th Aug 2015", "title": "Rich-country policy changes that could greatly benefit poor countries", "author": "TopherHallquist", "num_comments": "15 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>In the EA movement, there's a lot of enthusiasm for significantly increasing the number of immigrants able to come to countries like the United States each year. This would help the global poor in two ways: it would directly help immigrants who come to rich countries but wouldn't have been able to without the policy changes, and it would help family members of those immigrants who remain in the home country but receive remittances.</p>\n<p>But lately, I've been thinking a lot about other policy changes on the part of rich countries that could greatly benefit poor countries, ones that don't get discussed as much in the EA movement. Some ideas:</p>\n<p><em>Increasing government aid to poor countries: </em>This is kind of obvious, and I suspect many people dismiss it on the grounds that most voters wouldn't support it. But the <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/7/8/8894019/george-w-bush-pepfar\">President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief</a>\u00a0under George W. Bush suggests that efforts in this area may be more feasible than commonly assumed.</p>\n<p><em>Debt cancellation/creating a global bankruptcy process: </em>It might be tempting to assume that it would be easier to get money for, say, programs to combat disease than it would be to get money for outright cancellation of the debts of poor countries. On the other hand, the fact that many poor countries have debts that were originally contracted by corrupt dictators creates a moral case for debt cancellation that many find compelling.</p>\n<div>There's also the argument that creating a formal system for countries to go bankrupt would be an important reform, because well-designed financial systems <em>need </em>a bankruptcy process. This is especially true when we're talking about government debts of countries that borrow in foreign currencies, who can't simply reduce their debt burden thought inflation (something the United States could do if it really had to). The idea of creating an international government bankruptcy process has advocates from Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz to Pope Francis.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><em>Abolishing rich-country agricultural subsidies: </em>Like tight restrictions on immigration, there's a strong economic case to be made that agricultural subsidies don't actually help rich countries. But they do potentially do great harm to farmers in poor countries. I'm not very confident about how large the harm is\u2013I've heard claims that agricultural subsidies cost farmers in developing countries <a href=\"http://www.ncpa.org/pub/ba547\">$24 billion per year</a>, though I haven't tried to check that particular number.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Of course, any of these policy changes would be more difficult to get implemented than simply donating a little more to AMF or GiveDirectly, so the potential benefits would have to be weighed against the difficulty of bringing about these policy changes. Still, they look worth investigating. I've only started looking into them myself, which is why I'm creating this thread, so that if anyone has anything to add to what I've said, or has other ideas for things that could be high-impact, they can post their ideas here.</div></div></div>"},

In their own words:</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>We believe in a simple philosophy: choose your cause with your heart, but your nonprofit with your head. A powerful mission is just the start. Diligent donors then ask the next question: does the nonprofit use and produce appropriate evidence of impact on that mission?</p>\n<p>We conduct \u201cimpact audits\u201d, short-term engagements with two objectives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Help nonprofits:\u00a0</strong>Guide nonprofits in strengthening their use and production of appropriate evidence of impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Help donors:</strong>\u00a0Certify to donors that an organization is appropriately evidence-based.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong id=\"The_result_is_simple__nonprofits_get_tailored_guidance_on_how_to_improve_their_use_of_evidence__and_donors_can_be_confident_their_charitable_dollars_are_advancing_the_mission_they_care_about_\">The result is simple: nonprofits get tailored guidance on how to improve their use of evidence, and donors can be confident their charitable dollars are advancing the mission they care about.</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<hr>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2 id=\"HISTORY\">HISTORY</h2>\n<p>ImpactMatters was founded by Yale economist Dean Karlan and his former student Elijah Goldberg in 2015 to solve two critical gaps in the nonprofit sector. First, nonprofits that want to be more evidence-based in their work often don't have the expertise or guidance to figure out how. Second, while we now know a lot more than a few decades ago about what does and doesn't work, for example to increase literacy or reduce child deaths, it is often difficult to map that evidence-base to nonprofits.</p>\n<p>Enter the\u00a0<strong>impact audit</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"APPROACH\">APPROACH</h2>\n<p>We call these two gaps the \"nonprofit rating\" problem.\u00a0Many nonprofit organizations struggle to use evidence to guide their decision-making. Similarly, many donors struggle to assess the impact of nonprofits. An<strong>\u00a0impact audit</strong>\u00a0solves these related challenges:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Provides value back to the nonprofit:</strong>\u00a0Following the review, we provide a detailed private management letter to the organization. The management letter includes specific recommendations for how the nonprofit can improve its program and operations. In addition, the letter directs the nonprofit to resources and organizations that can help with specific needs. ImpactMatters does not serve as an consultant, but rather provides independent recommendations for how the nonprofit can improve its work.</li>\n<li><strong>Certifies appropriately evidence-based nonprofits to funders:\u00a0</strong>ImpactMatters believes donors should choose their cause with their heart, but their nonprofits with their head. Our impact audits make choosing a nonprofit easier, by certifying nonprofits as appropriately evidence-based. Often, we will look for evidence from a randomized trial to make that certification. However, a core belief at ImpactMatters is that not every nonprofit needs a randomized trial: some programs cannot be tested with randomized trials, and others can rely on randomized trial results from elsewhere.\u00a0We look for appropriate evidence, making the process selective while still allowing recommendations across a range of causes. As a result, donors can give with their heart while remaining confident in the impact of their philanthropy.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"METRICS_OF_OUR_OWN_SUCCESS\">METRICS OF OUR OWN SUCCESS</h2>\n<p>We define success as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organizations shift towards more evidence-based programming as appropriate</li>\n<li>Donations shift to appropriately evidence-based organizations</li>\n<li>Impact audit standards are adopted by others, creating a market for impact</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>"},

{"date": "16th Nov 2015", "title": "More on REG's Room for More Funding", "author": "MichaelDickens", "num_comments": "18 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>Cross-posted to <a href=\"http://mdickens.me/2015/11/16/more_on_reg's_room_for_more_funding/\">my blog</a>.</em></p>\n<p>UPDATE: Since I wrote this post before the winter fundraising season, I no longer have sufficiently good information about REG's funding situation to make claims about its room for more funding. I personally would not donate more money to REG without first learning more about how it could use additional funds.</p>\n<p>I have received some interest from a few people in donating to <a href=\"http://reg-charity.org/\">REG</a>, and the main concern I\u2019ve heard has been about whether REG could effectively use additional funding. I spent some more time learning about this. My broad conclusion is roughly the same as <a href=\"/ea/ns/my_cause_selection_michael_dickens/#room-for-more-funding-6\">I wrote previously</a>: REG can probably make good use of an additional $100,000 or so, and perhaps more but with less confidence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Poker_Market_Saturation\">Poker Market Saturation</h2>\n<p>Tobias from REG claims that about 70% of high-earning poker players have heard of REG, although many of those have had only limited engagement. He claims that they have had the most success convincing players to join through personal contact, and REG has not had contact with many of the players who have heard of it. This gives some reason to be optimistic that REG can expand substantially among high-earning poker players, although I would not be surprised if it started hitting rapidly diminishing returns once it grows to about 2x its current size.</p>\n<p>To date, REG has not spent much effort on marketing to non-high-earning poker players. This field is much larger, but targeting lower-earning players should be less efficient because each individual player donates less money. To get a better sense of how important this is, I would have to know what the income distribution looks like for poker players, and getting this information is nontrivial.</p>\n<p>REG would like to hire a <a href=\"/ea/ns/my_cause_selection_michael_dickens/52x\">new marketing person</a> with experience in the poker world. They would probably be considerably better at marketing than any of the current REG employees. For this reason, additional funds to REG may actually be more effective than past funds, although this is difficult to predict in advance.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<h2 id=\"New_Plans_and_Expansion\">New Plans and Expansion</h2>\n<p>REG has partnered with <a href=\"http://reg-charity.org/reg-summer-charity-festival-at-kings-casino/\">King\u2019s Casino</a> to get donations from poker tournaments. This fundraising model is less explored but has some potential. REG is also moving into marketing toward <a href=\"http://reg-charity.org/reg-expands-into-daily-fantasy-sports-dfs-charity/\">Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS)</a> players. It\u2019s unclear how valuable these new programs will be, but it\u2019s plausible that they will produce about as many donations per dollar or hour invested as the original REG model. These programs have high learning value, so I am interested in funding REG to help it carry out these programs and see what kind of results they can get.</p>\n<p>Then there are REG\u2019s other expansion areas. It has plans to expand the model to a few other fields. The REG founders are putting some thought into choosing where to expand and they appear to be doing a good job making these choices, but even so, it\u2019s difficult to predict in advance how receptive people in a new field will be to the REG message. There\u2019s probably nothing special about poker players in particular, so I would expect similar fields to show comparable conversion rates. When considering that REG could expand into a lot of other fields, room for more funding starts to look like less of a concern. At the same time, the more different a field is from professional poker, the less confident we can be that the REG model will work well. DFS is sufficiently similar that I would expect the conversion rate to look about the same. For other fields REG may move into, like gaming and tennis, it\u2019s harder to predict what the results would look like. Still, I would be surprised if conversion rates among tennis players were a lot worse than among poker players.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Daily_Fantasy_Sports\">Daily Fantasy Sports</h2>\n<p>To get a stronger sense of REG\u2019s room to expand, the obvious thing worth learning is the size of the DFS market. A <a href=\"http://www.ifrahlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Eilers_Fantasy-Bold-Predictions-2015-FSTA-2.pdf\">report from Eilers Research</a> claims that the size of the DFS market was $2.5 billion in 2015, and that DraftKings (who REG works with) has raised $76M in funding (suggesting a valuation of perhaps $300-600M). The market here is much larger than REG\u2019s current capacity to direct donations, although we care more about the size of the market among high-earning players. <a href=\"https://dailyfantasywinners.com/art/can-you-win-playing-daily-fantasy-sports/\">This article</a> claims \u201cat least 5 daily fantasy professionals who have won tournaments for over $1,000,000 this year\u201d which is not a lot, although it also claims that a lot more players than that have had large winnings. It doesn\u2019t give any specific numbers or sources.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/16705-u-s-online-poker-market-could-be-2-2-billion-a-year-under-nationwide-industry\">this interview</a>, the online poker market was $2.2B as of about two years ago. This suggests that the DFS market is not much smaller than the poker market (although the $2.2B figure doesn\u2019t include in-person poker\u2013I couldn\u2019t find good data on this). DFS will probably continue to grow, so it looks like REG\u2019s expansion into DFS has reasonably good potential. My guess is that the poker market will result in more overall donations than DFS, but the difference is not large, so REG can probably get a lot of value from expanding into daily fantasy sports.</p>\n<p>New York <a href=\"/www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/sports/football/draftkings-fanduel-new-york-attorney-general-tells-fantasy-sites-to-stop-taking-bets-in-new-york.html\">just declared</a> that fantasy sports constitute illegal gambling. This makes the future of the DFS market look somewhat more uncertain. We can make up some numbers to get a rough idea of how important this is. Perhaps this reduces the size of the DFS market by 20% in expectation, and REG relies on DFS for 20% of its money moved in the medium term. That means this decision by New York makes REG look 4% worse. That\u2019s nontrivial but not hugely concerning by itself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Other_Considerations\">Other Considerations</h2>\n<p>I have been impressed by REG\u2019s openness and ability to answer my questions. When I asked Tobias about the size of the poker market, he had good information about the space and about how REG was positioned. He was optimistic about the room to expand within the poker space. I am somewhat skeptical about this claim because anyone at a charity is incentivized to believe that it can absorb a lot more money; but even if the professional poker space is close to saturation, REG has clear room to expand into other areas (such as partnering with casinos or applying the model to other fields such as daily fantasy sports). At this time I still feel confident recommending that small donors <a href=\"http://reg-charity.org/donate/\">support REG</a>.</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "14th Dec 2015", "title": "Effective Giving vs. Effective Altruism", "author": "Gleb_T", "num_comments": "13 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Why separate effective giving from Effective Altruism? Isn't the whole point of EA about effective giving, meaning giving to the most impactful charities to advance human flourishing? Sure, effective giving is the point of EA, but there might be a lot of benefit to drawing a distinct line between the movement of Effective Altruism itself, and the ideas of effective giving that it promotes. That's something that Kerry Vaughn, <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/team\">the Executive Director of Effective Altruism Outreach</a>, and I, the <a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/Intentional-Insights-Spreading-Effective-Giving-Ideas-Effectively-to-Broad-Audiences-UTiM2viNkrp\">President of Intentional Insights</a>, discussed in our recent phone call, after having an <a href=\"/ea/ov/improving_the_effectiveness_of_effective_altruism/5ma\">online discussion on this forum</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>**EDIT** To be clear, Kerry Vaughn did not explicitly endorse Intentional Insights' work in any way, and is not in a position to do so, as you can see from his comment on this post below.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why draw that line? Because there's quite a bit of danger in rapid movement growth of attracting people who might dilute the EA movement and impair the building of good infrastructure down the road (see this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCOOtc-sofM&amp;feature=youtu.be\">video</a> and <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/MovementGrowth.pdf\">paper</a>). This exemplifies the dangers of simply promoting Effective Altruism indiscriminately, and just trying to grow the movement as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thus, what we can orient toward is using modern marketing strategies to spread the ideas of effective altruism - what Kerry and I labeled effective giving in our conversations - without necessarily trying to spread the movement. We can spread the notion of giving not simply from the heart, but also using the head. We can talk about fighting the <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm\">drowning child problem</a>. We can talk about researching charities and using GiveWell, The Life You Can Save, and other evidence-based charity evaluators to guide one's giving. We can build excitement about giving well, and encourage people to think of themselves as <a href=\"/ea/pp/be_a_superdonor_promoting_effective_altruism_by/\">Superdonors</a> or <a href=\"/ea/pp/be_a_superdonor_promoting_effective_altruism_by/5kz\">Mega-Lifesavers</a>. We can use effective marketing strategies such as <a href=\"/ea/or/making_effective_altruism_more_emotionally/\">speaking to people's emotions</a> and <a href=\"/ea/ov/improving_the_effectiveness_of_effective_altruism/\">using stories,</a> and <a href=\"/ea/qk/maximizing_donations_to_effective_charities/\">contributing to meta-charities</a> such as EA Outreach and others that do such work.\u00a0 That's why we at Intentional Insights focus on spending our resources on spreading the message of effective giving, as we believe that getting ten more people to give effectively is more impactful than us giving of our resources to effective charities ourselves. At the same time, Kerry and I spoke of avoiding heavily promoting effective altruism as a movement or using emotionally engaging narratives to associate positive feelings with it - instead, just associating positive feelings with effective giving, and leaving bread crumbs for people who want to explore Effective Altruism through brief mentions and links.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let's go <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/bc3/sotw_be_specific/\">specific and concrete</a>. Here's an example of what I mean: <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gleb-tsipursky/how-to-avoid-feeling-chea_b_8635224.html\">an article in The Huffington Post</a> that encourages people to give effectively, and only briefly mention Effective Altruism. Doing so balances the benefits of using marketing tactics to channel money to effective charities, while not heavily promoting EA itself to ameliorate the dangers of rapid movement growth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Check out the sharing buttons on it, and you'll see it was shared quite widely, over 1K times. As you'll see from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1079797162070769&amp;id=468695349847623\">this Facebook comment on my personal page</a>, it helped convince someone to decide to donate to effective charities. Furthermore, this comment is someone who is the leader of a large secular group in Houston, and he thus has an impact on a number of other people. Since people rarely make actual comments, and far from all are fans of my Facebook page, we can estimate that many more made similar decisions but chose not to comment about it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another example. <a href=\"https://secularstudents.org/givinggame\">Here is a link</a> to the outcome of an Intentional Insights collaboration with The Life You Can Save to spread effective giving to the reason-oriented community through Giving Games. In a Giving Game, participants in a workshop learn about a few pre-selected charities, think about and discuss their relative merits, and choose which charity will get a real donation, $10 per participant. We have launched a pilot program with the Secular Student Alliance to bring Giving Games to over 300 secular student groups throughout the world, with The Life You Can Save dedicating $10,000 to the pilot program, and easily capable of raising more if it works well. As you'll see from the link, it briefly mentions Effective Altruism, and focuses mainly on education in effective giving itself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Such articles as the one in The Huffington Post, shared widely in social media, attest to the popularity of effective giving as a notion, separate from Effective Altruism itself. As you saw, it is immediately impactful in getting some people to give to effective charities, and highly likely gets others to think in this direction. I had a conversation with a number of leaders of local EA groups, for example with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfredoparrah\">Alfredo Parra</a> in Munich, excited about the possibility of translating and adapting this article to their local context, and all of you are free to do so as well - I encourage you to cite me/Intentional Insights in doing so, but if you can't, it's fine as well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That gets to another point that Kerry and I discussed, namely the benefits of having some EAs who specialize in promoting ideas about effective giving, and more broadly integrating promotion of effective giving as something that EAs do in general. Some EAs can do the most good by working hard and devoting 10% of their money to charity. Some can do the most good by thinking hard about the big issues. Some can do the most good by growing the internal capacity and infrastructures of the movement, and getting worthy people on board. Others can do the most good by getting non-EAs to channel their money toward effective charities through effective marketing and persuasion tactics.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Intentional Insights orients toward providing the kind of content that can be easily adapted and shared by these EAs widely. It's a work in progress, to create and improve this content. We are also working with other EA meta-charities such as The Life You Can Save and others.<span> Another area to work on is not only content creation, but content optimization and testing - I talked with <a href=\"http://eahub.org/user/konrad-seifert\">Konrad Seifert</a> from Geneva about testing our content at a university center there. Moreover, we should develop the infrastructure to integrate spreading effective giving into EA activities, something</span> EA Outreach may potentially collaborate with us on, depending on further discussions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So these are some initial thoughts, which I wanted to bring to the community for discussion. What do you think of this line of work, and what are your ideas for optimization? Thanks!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>P.S. </span><span>This article is part of the </span><a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/EA-Marketing-Resource-Bank-Rq2ckmtIxUY\"><span>EA Marketing Resource Bank</span></a><span> project lead by </span><a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/Intentional-Insights-UTiM2viNkrp\"><span>Intentional Insights</span></a><span> and the </span><a href=\"http://dotimpact.im/focusprojects/lean/\"><span>Local Effective Altruism Network</span></a><span>, with support from </span><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\"><span>The Life You Can Save</span></a><span>.</span></p></div></div>"},

GiveWell and Y Combinator have significantly different approaches to selecting non-profits to fund. Whereas GiveWell seeks the most effective charities and causes, Y Combinator uses a portfolio approach of funding several projects that satisfy certain criteria (e.g.\u00a0solving real problems and commitment to <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html\">growth</a>). In general, Y Combinator seems to take the approach they use for for-profits and apply it to non-profits. In particular this means they focus on non-profits that center around information technology, where they have the most experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why_look_at_Y_Combinator_\">Why look at Y Combinator?</h2>\n<p>My motivation for looking into Y Combinator\u2019s non-profit program was in the context of <a href=\"http://causeprioritization.org/\">my work on cause prioritization</a>. I\u2019ve been interested in <a href=\"http://causeprioritization.org/List%20of%20groups%20and%20people%20doing%20cause%20prioritization%20research\">different approaches to cause selection and prioritization</a>, so looking at how a successful for-profit organization like Y Combinator approaches the problem is prima facie likely to provide insight that is distinct from that provided by looking at non-profit organizations like GiveWell. I also treated this investigation as a \u201ctest case\u201d to see if this sort of overview of different approaches and comparison is useful.</p>\n<p>To elaborate, there are several reasons looking into something like Y Combinator might be important for effective altruism (and especially cause prioritization) and why I decided to look into it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>As a general principle, within reasonable bounds, trying to gather the thinking of as diverse a collection of groups as possible seems like a good idea, in terms of having access to a larger pool of approaches with which to compare one\u2019s own approach and <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Which-people-have-done-the-most-to-expand-your-imagination-of-whats-possible\">expanding one\u2019s imagination of what\u2019s possible</a>. At the very least, it shows that one has \u201cdone one\u2019s homework\u201d. Moreover, looking beyond self-professed effective altruists and their favorite go-to people and projects can help to keep effective altruism from seeming too <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/r/lesswrong/lw/j8n/a_critique_of_effective_altruism/#monoculture\">insular</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Y Combinator has spent a lot of time thinking about which for-profits to fund. While this is not directly related to the non-profits that effective altruists tend to look into, Y Combinator\u2019s for-profit work <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/16/y-combinator-1-billion/\">has clearly been valuable</a><a href=\"#yc-fn1\"><sup>1</sup></a>, so we can expect to gain insight in terms of the general task of \u201cdeciding which projects to fund\u201d.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As Y Combinator has now begun evaluating non-profits, it\u2019s now possible to attempt a more direct comparison between, say, how Y Combinator chooses its non-profits versus how GiveWell does.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It\u2019s possible to expand the existing <a href=\"http://causeprioritization.org/Analogs%20in%20the%20non-profit%20world%20of%20for-profit%20ideas\">discussion of for-profits versus non-profits</a> (or more generally, just talking about non-profits in the context of for-profits or using a \u201cfor-profit mindset\u201d of sorts).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There seems to be a class of people who are receptive to Y Combinator\u2019s work (and the tech-sector/startup approach to improving the world) yet unwilling to embrace \u201ceffective altruism\u201d (see for instance <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/m8o/open_thread_may_25_may_31_2015/cei1\">shminux\u2019s comment in a LessWrong open thread</a> and also possibly <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/mg2/effective_altruism_from_xyz_perspective/\">Effective Altruism from XYZ perspective</a>). Figuring out how effective altruist approaches differ from that of Y Combinator can elucidate this difference in response by this class to some extent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is already interest in this topic. For instance GiveWell has been highly interested in different approaches to philanthropy. They have even begun their <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/history-of-philanthropy\">History of Philanthropy</a> project, which \u201caims to better understand the role that philanthropy, as opposed to other factors, played in various historical episodes that some people have identified as \u2018philanthropic successes.\u2019\u2009\u201d</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, it\u2019s possible that looking into Y Combinator\u2019s non-profit program, or the approaches of others, isn\u2019t all that important. It\u2019s also unclear whether this sort of investigation is tractable. As GiveWell has often noted, organizations don\u2019t do a lot of explicit prioritization work,<a href=\"#yc-fn2\"><sup>2</sup></a> and even if they do, they don\u2019t release a lot of their actual work/thought process.<a href=\"#yc-fn3\"><sup>3</sup></a> It\u2019s also unclear whether groups hold themselves to a high enough epistemic standard, and even if they do, they may not be very good at explaining their reasoning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Background_on_Y_Combinator_s_non_profit_program\">Background on Y Combinator\u2019s non-profit program</h2>\n<p>Y Combinator <a href=\"http://old.ycombinator.com/watsi.html\">began funding non-profits</a> in 2013 when it included <a href=\"http://watsi.org/\">Watsi</a>, a crowdfunding non-profit for medical treatments, in its funding batch. Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After we met the founders of Watsi, we realized they\u2019d be the perfect [non-profit] to start with.</p>\n<p>We owe Hacker News thanks for introducing us to Watsi. When Watsi launched, they posted about themselves on HN. They were a hit with HN users and raised a significant amount of money.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since then, they\u2019ve also funded <a href=\"https://www.zidisha.org/\">Zidisha</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bayesimpact.org/\">Bayes Impact</a>, <a href=\"http://codenow.org/\">CodeNow</a>, <a href=\"http://caremessage.org/\">CareMessage</a>, <a href=\"http://www.noorahealth.org/\">Noora Health</a>, <a href=\"https://www.1deg.org/\">One Degree</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.immunityproject.org/\">Immunity Project</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.detroitwaterproject.org/\">Detroit Water Project</a>, <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a>, <a href=\"http://democracyos.org/\">DemocracyOS</a>, and possibly more<a href=\"#yc-fn4\"><sup>4</sup></a>. Note that this is still quite a small number compared to <a href=\"http://yclist.com/\">all the startups they\u2019ve funded so far</a>.<a href=\"#yc-fn5\"><sup>5</sup></a></p>\n<p>Y Combinator\u2019s non-profit program is distinct from <a href=\"http://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-research\">YC Research</a>, which is newer and targets \u201cfundamental research\u201d and innovation that takes a long time to develop. I won\u2019t consider YC Research in this post.</p>\n<p>For the rest of this post, I want to go into how Y Combinator chooses which non-profits to fund, by looking at both what it says on the topic and also its actual choices.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Y_Combinator_s_explicit_reasoning\">Y Combinator\u2019s explicit reasoning</h2>\n<p>Compared to an organization like GiveWell, with its <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/about/transparency\">commitment to transparency</a>, there is relatively little that Y Combinator has said about its reasoning in deciding which non-profits to fund.<a href=\"#yc-fn6\"><sup>6</sup></a> That isn\u2019t to say they\u2019ve been completely reticent though. For instance, in <a href=\"http://www.ycombinator.com/nonprofits/\">one of the original announcements about non-profits</a>, Paul Graham writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We don\u2019t know how many nonprofits we\u2019ll fund, or what type of ideas we\u2019ll like. We like Watsi a lot, because they help people who really need help, and do it in an efficient and transparent way. But fundamentally this is an experiment, just like YC itself was at first. So we don\u2019t want to tell people too precisely what we\u2019re looking for, because we\u2019re not sure yet what we\u2019re looking for.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More substantive is <a href=\"http://www.newprofit.org/interview-with-y-combinators-kate-courteau-part-1/\">an interview done with Y Combinator\u2019s Kate Courteau</a> (who is Director of Y Combinator Nonprofits). Courteau explains how funding Watsi led to them considering more non-profits:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WATSI told us how much the YC program impacted their progress so we realized that a lot of the benefit of YC could be universally applied to all startups; for-profit and nonprofit. We also recognized that the WATSI team operated in the way that most great for-profit startups do. They were very determined and focused and moved quickly; launching early and iterating based on watching how their users interacted with their site. They had a vision for the future of WATSI. It\u2019s evolved a bit but they continue to be a strong, mission-based company that works in the nonprofit world in a very transparent way. This experiment seemed to work so well that in January 2014, we decided to officially launch our nonprofit program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, she says the following, which might be the closest thing to understanding how they \u201cselect causes\u201d. The essential idea seems to be that Y Combinator is using the same framework with non-profits that they already use in determining which for-profits to fund:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>YC\u2019s motto is: \u201cMake something people want.\u201d In the for-profit space, we found that the best startup ideas come from founders solving problems they have encountered themselves. This works much better than thinking, \u201cI\u2019d like to start a company. What should I work on?\u201d This concept also applies to nonprofits. It\u2019s really important to work on something that you are passionate about and have some history with because startups are really hard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The rhetoric is definitely different from what one hears from effective altruist types: instead of \u201cproven, cost-effective, and scalable\u201d (<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/process\">GiveWell</a>) or \u201cthe most good with your donations\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/how-we-assess-charities\">Giving What We Can</a>), it\u2019s \u2018being passionate about the work you do\u2019, and also \u2018understanding other people\u2019s cultures\u2019<a href=\"#yc-fn7\"><sup>7</sup></a> and \u2018building a userbase\u2019<a href=\"#yc-fn8\"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.newprofit.org/interview-with-y-combinators-kate-courteau-part-2/\">part 2 of the interview</a>, Courteau elaborates on another part of Y Combinator\u2019s thought process:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the biggest problems in the nonprofit world is the lack of early financial support and mentorship for young entrepreneurs who have innovative ideas about how to solve some of the world\u2019s largest problems. This lack of early support is discouraging to really smart people who might have great potential to tackle these big problems. At YC we invest in people and we\u2019re not afraid of teams with ambitious or potentially polarizing ideas. We recognize that a lot of startups fail but we believe that it\u2019s worth the investment even if there\u2019s only a small chance that an ambitious approach can solve a really big problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, unlike GiveWell\u2019s traditional work, which tries to find the \u201cvery best\u201d charities, Y Combinator takes a portfolio investment approach, where it \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter\u201d whether any particular non-profit succeeds or fails, as long as on average they do a lot of good. So the Y Combinator mentality is something more like \u201ctry a bunch and see what works\u201d, not \u201cresearch a bunch and fund what works\u201d.</p>\n<p>Of course, given that Y Combinator\u2019s main work focuses on for-profits, it\u2019s possible to take whatever explicit reasoning they\u2019ve made public regarding for-profits as a proxy for their non-profits reasoning, especially since they acknowledge this influence. I won\u2019t elaborate on this, but some places to look at are Paul Graham\u2019s essays like \u201c<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html\">How to Start a Startup</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/ds.html\">Do Things that Don\u2019t Scale</a>\u201d.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Overview_of_actual_non_profits_Y_Combinator_has_funded\">Overview of actual non-profits Y Combinator has funded</h2>\n<p>In this section I want to list the non-profits Y Combinator has decided to fund so far, then try to see what might be some reasons they were chosen. At first I just want to list these and give brief descriptions of what they do because I think it\u2019s illustrative; I\u2019ll give my thoughts after the list. As mentioned near the beginning of the post, the ones I\u2019ll look at are Watsi, Zidisha, Bayes Impact, CodeNow, CareMessage, Noora Health, One Degree, the Immunity Project, the Detroit Water Project, 80,000 Hours, and DemocracyOS.<a href=\"#yc-fn9\"><sup>9</sup></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Watsi is a website that helps people crowdfund medical treatments for people.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Zidisha is a \u201cpeer-to-peer microlending service\u201d that \u201callows people to lend small amounts of money directly to entrepreneurs in developing countries\u201d.<a href=\"#yc-fn10\"><sup>10</sup></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bayes Impact is a bit vague; <a href=\"http://www.bayesimpact.org/about\">their website</a> describes themselves as \u201ca group of practical idealists who believe that applied properly, data can be used to solve the world\u2019s biggest problems\u201d.<a href=\"#yc-fn11\"><sup>11</sup></a> Y Combinator explains Bayes Impact in <a href=\"http://blog.ycombinator.com/harnessing-big-data-for-social-good-nonprofit-bayes-impact-yc-s14-launches\">its announcement</a> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bayes Impact is a nonprofit that deploys teams of data scientists to create data-driven solutions for challenging social problems. The organization runs full-time fellowship programs that bring together domain experts and data scientists from top technology companies and academic institutions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>CodeNow runs workshops designed to teach people programming. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/27/codenow-joins-y-combinator/\">TechCrunch explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CodeNow aims to teach programming basics to high schoolers, particularly girls, ethnic minorities, and other underrepresented groups. It launched in Washington, D.C. in 2011 before <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/14/codenow-nyc/\">expanding to New York City</a> and San Francisco last year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CareMessage; <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/25/y-combinator-backed-caremessage-is-on-a-mission-to-improve-health-literacy-by-bringing-mobile-healthcare-to-the-underserved/\">TechCrunch on CareMessage</a> (March 2014):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Considering that 70 percent of older patients have difficulty using and understanding printed materials, <a href=\"http://caremessage.org/\">CareMessage</a> thinks this is where technology can really help, and is likely needed most. The Y Combinator-backed non-profit startup is launching today to provide clinics and healthcare organizations with software and interactive mobile programs that help them stay in touch with (and engage) at risk patients.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that \u201cwhere technology [\u2026] is likely needed most\u201d is a bold claim.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Noora Health; <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/23/noora-healths-training-program-for-patients-and-caregivers-improves-recovery-and-reduces-readmission-rates/\">TechCrunch article on Noora Health</a> (March 2014):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The nonprofit graduating from Y Combinator is building hospital education platforms for patients and their family members to teach them the skills needed to recover from a major medical event (like a surgery) or manage chronic conditions like diabetes and palliative care.

Since its launch, the company has expanded to Baltimore with the Baltimore Water Project.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>80,000 Hours is a website and service that gives people career advice so they can maximize their social impact. There is a TechCrunch article (\u201c<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/08/04/80000-hours/\">Want To Make An Impact With Your Work? Try Some Advice From 80,000\u00a0Hours</a>\u201d), and Benjamin Todd of 80,000 Hours has also announced their involvement with Y Combinator in \u201c<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/08/why-is-80000-hours-in-y-combinator-as-a-non-profit-and-whats-it-like/\">What\u2019s it like being a non-profit in Y Combinator?</a>\u201d. 80,000 Hours is also an <a href=\"https://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">explicitly effective altruist</a> organization. Since its involvement with Y Combinator, 80,000 Hours has focused more on growth; see for instance \u201c<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/11/take-the-growth-approach-to-evaluating-startup-non-profits-not-the-marginal-approach/\">Take the growth approach to evaluating startup non-profits, not the marginal approach</a>\u201d.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>DemocracyOS is a platform that allows people to discuss policy ideas.<a href=\"#yc-fn13\"><sup>13</sup></a> The same people are involved in the Argentine <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Party\">Net Party</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It should be noted that the vast majority of the non-profits in the list have to do with information technology. The Immunity Project might be an exception in this regard (it still involves technology, but does not aim to provide an app or website). This is probably the case because Y Combinator doesn\u2019t just want to give money to the startups, but rather also wants to provide assistance, connections, etc. Y Combinator has the most experience with information technology, so this makes sense. And because they have the most experience here, they also have more experience reviewing ideas here, which helps them pick good ideas.</p>\n<p>Some of the startups (like CodeNow) may come across to effective altruists as being particularly \u201cineffective\u201d. Indeed, their <a href=\"http://codenow.org/the-program/\">results section</a> seems to consist of a single graphic and testimonials from students. Here it might be worth noting that Y Combinator has a particular audience they might cater to (consisting of programmers and other tech people).</p>\n<h2 id=\"Comparison_to_GiveWell_and_the_Open_Philanthropy_Project\">Comparison to GiveWell and the Open Philanthropy Project</h2>\n<p>Besides the rhetorical differences noted above, there are several other important differences between Y Combinator\u2019s non-profit program and GiveWell/Open Phil.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Unlike GiveWell\u2019s traditional work, which funds existing charities that have produced significant results, Y Combinator\u2019s non-profit program (with a few exceptions) targets non-profits that are just starting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Y Combinator also hasn\u2019t formulated their selection process explicitly as <em>cause selection</em>. Rather, they seem to be paying attention to a lower level of selection (compared to the high (cause) level selection) in a particular area (namely those interventions involving information technology). In this sense, Y Combinator\u2019s approach might be similar to investigating all interventions that involve leafleting (whatever the cause).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>So far, Y Combinator\u2019s non-profit program has been similar to the Open Philanthropy Project and distinct from GiveWell in that rather than recommending non-profits for individual donors, they provide the funding themselves. Indeed, for its part, the Open Philanthropy Project has explicitly stated that their \u201cdecisions about whether or not to make a grant to an organization should probably not be taken as a signal to donors about whether or not they should donate\u201d<a href=\"#yc-fn14\"><sup>14</sup></a>. Y Combinator is not as explicit as the Open Philanthropy Project in this regard, and from what I have seen, they do not explicitly suggest people to donate to the projects they fund, either (they just announce their own funding).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Document_source_and_versions\">Document source and versions</h2>\n<p>The source files used to compile this document are available <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/riceissa/64cb3fdec70647dc67bd\">in a GitHub Gist</a>.

It describes a model of what \"effective altruism\" actually means, looks at common objections to it and attempts to weigh each one in turn.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Description_of_effective_altruism_and_background\">Description of effective altruism and background</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Effective altruism encourages individuals to make altruism a central part of their lives, and combines this with a more specific commitment to do as much expected good as possible, typically by contributing money to the best-performing aid and development organizations. Effective altruists are also committed to the idea that scientific analysis and careful reasoning can help us identify which course of action is best.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>The paper also praises the EA movement for important successes: the establishment of new meta-charities, creating an incentive to demonstrate effectiveness, and drawing attention to the message that individuals in high-income countries have the power to do \"an incredible amount of good\".</span></p>\n<p><span>Gabriel also makes an interesting claim about the dynamics of private donations vs. government aid, and how they can be influenced:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the distortions that affect private giving are both more serious and less deeply entrenched than those that affect the distribution of aid. These distortions are more serious because only a tiny percentage of the money donated by individuals makes its way to the world's poorest people, where it would often do the most good. They are less entrenched because they often result from a lack of information, or carelessness, rather than from the pursuit of competing geopolitical aims. Taken together, these considerations suggest that there is an important opportunity for moral leverage</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gabriel points out that EA has met with \"considerable resistance among aid practitioners and activists\" and that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe that it can be explained both by the competitive dynamics that exist within the philanthropic sector and also by deeper disagreements about value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"Thick_and_thin_versions_of_effective_altruism\">Thick and thin versions of effective altruism</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The thin version of the doctrine holds that 'we should do the most good we can' [...] The thick version of effective altruism makes a number of further assumptions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These further assumptions can be summarized as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Welfarism: \"Good states of affairs are those in which suffering is reduced and premature loss of life averted.\"</li>\n<li>Consequentialism</li>\n<li>Scientific approach: \"It is possible to provide sound general advice about how individual people can do the most good\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The paper focusses on the thick version. It also (for reasons of space) leaves non-human animal issues aside.</p>\n<p>I'm leaving most of my own remarks to the comments section, but I'll just point out here that the \"thick\" and \"thin\" versions of EA described by Gabriel don't <em>exactly</em> correspond to the \"core idea\" and \"associated ideas\" <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/07/disagreeing-about-whats-effective-isnt-disagreeing-with-effective-altruism/\">described by Wiblin</a> in his response.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Is_effective_altruism_unjust_\">Is effective altruism unjust?</h2>\n<p><strong>Equality</strong>: the paper claims that while people in the EA movement recognize that equality is instrumentally important, most do not believe equality has any intrinsic value. This is illustrated with the <em>two villages</em> thought experiment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are two villages, each in a different country. Both stand in need of assistance but they are unaware of each other and never interact. As a donor, you must choose between financing one of two programs. The first program allocates an equal amount of money to projects in each community and achieves substantial overall benefit. The second program allocates all of the money to one village and none to the other. By concentrating resources it achieves a marginally greater gain in overall welfare than the first project</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The claim in this example is that EAs prefer the second program, while people with \"an intuitive commitment to fairness\" prefer the first.</p>\n<p>Gabriel lists three possible responses EA could give to this criticism:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bite the bullet, and insist that equality has no independent weight (and that the second program in the example is better)</li>\n<li>Modify our utility functions to include a term for equality (although Gabriel doesn't quite put it in those words)</li>\n<li>Use equality as a tie-breaker</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Priority</strong>: the paper makes the empirical claim that the very poorest people in the world are often particularly hard to help. It claims that while EA would tend to ignore such cases, many people believe they should be prioritized - either because meeting urgent claims first is a basic component of morality, or because of some need to justify state power.</p>\n<p>Again there is a thought experiment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Ultrapoverty</em>. There are a large number of people living in extreme poverty. Within this group, some people are worse-off than others. As a donor, you must choose between financing one of two development interventions. The first program focuses on those who will benefit the most. It targets literate men in urban areas, and has considerable success in sustainably lifting them out of poverty. The second program focuses on those who are most in need of assistance. It works primarily with illiterate widows and disabled people who live in rural areas. It also has some success in lifting these people out of poverty but is less successful at raising overall welfare.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gabriel points out that EA logic leads to supporting the literate men in this example, and that \"when this pattern of reasoning is iterated many times over, it leads to the systematic neglect of those at the very bottom - something that strikes many people as unjust.\"</p>\n<p>The possible responses listed are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bite the bullet</li>\n<li>\"endorse a defeasible priority principle that would give the claims of the worst-off some priority over the claims of the better-off, even if a higher total utility could be achieved by focusing on the latter group of people\" (I don't quite understand what this means)</li>\n<li>Use priority as a tie-breaker</li>\n<li>(Regarding the state power argument) apply different moral principles to political institutions vs. private donors</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Rights</strong>:the paper defines a right as \"a justified claim to some form of treatment by a person or institution that resists simple aggregation in moral reasoning\". This is illustrated with the following example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Sweatshop</em>. The country you are working in has seen a rapid expansion of dangerous and poorly regulated factory work in recent years. This trend has helped lift a large number of people out of poverty but has also led to an increase in workplace fatalities. As a donor, you are approached by a group of NGOs who want to campaign for better working conditions. There is reason to believe that they can persuade the government to introduce new legislation if they have your financial backing. These laws would regulate the industry but reduce the number of opportunities for employment in the country as a whole.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gabriel claims that most EAs would refuse to support this campaign, and cites William MacAskill as saying there is \"no question that [sweatshops] are good for the poor\". Gabriel argues that EAs could modify their theory to include independent weight to rights, but lists different possible outcomes for what this would mean for the <em>Sweatshop</em> case.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Is_effective_altruism_blind_\">Is effective altruism blind?</h2>\n<p>Here Gabriel addresses the question of how the scientific method is put into practice within the effective altruism movement, and whether this introduces various forms of systematic bias. He starts off by describing how GiveWell and Giving What We Can evaluate their charities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>assessing the scale of a problem</li>\n<li>looking for proven interventions to help with that problem</li>\n<li>looking for neglectedness</li>\n<li>audit of individual organizations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And then comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>all but one of the 'top charities' endorsed by GiveWell and GWWC focus on neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). They also make the movement vulnerable to the charge that it suffers from a form of methodological blindness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Materialism</strong> (1): the claim that EA overvalues hard evidence such as RCTs</p>\n<p><strong>Materialism </strong>(2): the claim that EA in practice relies too much on metrics such as the DALY that ignore factors such as autonomy or self-actualization, that we care about in principle. He says that EA has been improving in this area but that more still needs to be done.</p>\n<p><strong>Individualism</strong>: the claim that EA undervalues collective goods such as community empowerment and hope. This is illustrated with another thought experiment, the claim being that allocating 10% to ARVs leads to more hope.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Medicine</em>. According to recent estimates condom distribution is a far more effective way of minimizing the harm caused by HIV/AIDS than the provision of anti-retrovirals (AVR). Whereas ARVs help people who already have the virus, condoms help to prevent many more people from becoming infected. As a donor, you must choose between funding one of two National Action Plans. The first program allocates the entire sum of money to condom distribution. The second program allocates 90% to condom distribution and 10% to ARVs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Instrumentalism</strong>: this point seems somewhat abstract and is again maybe best illustrated with Gabriel's example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Participation</em>. There are a group of villages that require help developing their water and sanitation system in order to tackle the problem of waterborne parasites. As a donor you face a choice between funding one of two projects. The first project will hire national contractors to build the water and sanitation system, something that they have done successfully in the past. The second project works with members of the community to develop and build new facilities. This approach has also worked in the past, but because villagers lack expertise their systems tend to be less functional than the ones built by experts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gabriel's claim is that the community-based solution has better knock-on effects, such as greater autonomy and self-esteem, and valuing the community-built system more and hence maintaining it better. A simple cost-effectiveness estimate would overlook these.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Is_effective_altruism_effective_\">Is effective altruism effective?</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Effective altruists aim to make choices and life-decisions that do the greatest amount of overall good. This section asks how robust the advice they provide actually is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Counterfactuals</strong>: in possibly the most interesting claim in the paper, Gabriel asks us \"if individual people who are affiliated with the movement stopped giving a portion of their income to the top charities: would larger philanthropic organizations simply step in and fill the gap?\"</p>\n<p>Gabriel raises the obvious question of why large donors such as the Gates foundation haven't already fully funded charities such as AMF and SCI. He gives three suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The large donors aren't fully on board with the effectiveness thing</li>\n<li>Large donors may not feel that GiveWell and GWWC are doing their prioritization research correctly</li>\n<li>The EA movement is cute and needs to be supported in its growth by giving it some nice charities to play with (not Gabriel's exact words)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In support of the third claim, Gabriel points out that GiveWell is able to fully fund its top charities via Good Ventures, but has chosen not to do so. If true, it's fairly obviously problematic for us.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation and rationality</strong>: the claim is that to make it big, EA needs to understand psychology, and that we don't. In particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gabriel refers to David Brooks as saying that an earning-to-give career might not be psychologically sustainable for most people - even if it is for a few EAs.</li>\n<li>EA appeals too much to reason and not enough to emotion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Systemic change</strong>: the claim here is that EA could stand to learn from historical movements such as abolitionism and civil rights - in particular putting a greater focus on justice, and less on cost-effectiveness or on the feel-good factor of giving.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/13786913/Whats_Wrong_With_Effective_Altruism\">Read the full paper here</a>.

According to the WHO World Malaria report in 2014, there were an estimated 584\u00a0000 deaths (90% of all malaria deaths occur in Africa), of which an estimated 437\u00a0000 were African children who died before their fifth birthday due to malaria</span><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/johny/Downloads/SummaryofLongTermEffectsDraft2%20(1).docx#_ftn3\"><sup><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[3]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></span></sup></a><span>. </span></p>\n<p><span>This post will attempt to analyse the long-term effects of malaria on labour productivity.

Their findings imply that an increase in life expectancy from 40 to 60 years would double the population size over this forty year period, which is an increase in the annual growth rate of slightly less than 2%. They claim that the negative economic effects of rapid population growth more than compensated for direct economic benefits from better health, and so income per capita fell. </span></p>\n<p><span><span>Increased life expectancy reduced income per capita</span></span></p>\n<p><span>Ashraf et al. consider a stylized economy in which age-specific mortality and fertility rates have been constant for sufficiently long that the age structure of the population is unchanging<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/johny/Downloads/SummaryofLongTermEffectsDraft2%20(1).docx#_ftn5\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup><span>[5]</span></sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a>. The authors then consider an instantaneous shock to health that raises life expectancy at birth from 40 to 60 years, which raises population size by a factor of 1.36. As a result of this change they assess that at a horizon of 40 years, income per capita would fall by 20% in response to the rise in life expectancy from 40 to 60.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Ashraf et al. find a short run effect that is consistent with the findings of Acemoglu and Johnson discussed above, but they believe it\u2019s primarily through the demographic channel of raising the ratio of dependent children to working age adults. </span></p>\n<p><span>Fifteen years into the simulation, income per capita is five percent lower than it would have been absent the health improvement. In the long run though, they claim that the demographic effect is undone by endogenously falling fertility (as shown in Figure 1), while better health and higher education raise worker productivity, and so the effect on income reverses. Income per capita returns to its baseline level after 30 years, and in the long run is 15% higher thanks to the health improvement(as shown in Figure 2).</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0<span>Figure 1: Effect of Adjustment speed on population size (Figure and text adapted from Ashraf, Q.

After 25 years, the population is 20%, 24%, and 26% bigger in the three scenarios.

This was a key incentive in the employment seeking behaviour of potential workers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The total work force almost doubled from 1933 to 1934, whereas these dramatic increases in the number of employees were in stark contrast to neighbouring Belgian Congo and Southern Rhodesia. The total increase in the national income statistics for the same year revealed that 55% of the revenue was from mining. Thus, effective malaria control was a crucial driving force behind Northern Rhodesian economic development. Without it, the taxable national income would have been 28% lower and the percentage of national income from mining activities would have dropped to 37%. Integrated malaria control costed approximately 0.07% of the total revenues of US$ 7.1 billion by the copper mining companies, a minuscule amount compared to the growth of productivity that it triggered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Overall, a cross-country analysis indicated that nations with low malaria rates have a higher rate of economic growth. However, this analysis was based on a limited amount of countries and, as a result, it\u2019s difficult to determine how relevant these cases are to other African countries. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Economists who performed a growth regression analysis found that malaria can negatively affect economic growth. The index of malaria prevalence seems to have a negative impact on adult income (40-60% decrease) or per capita household consumption (0.25-3.22%) but these values should mainly be interpreted as rough estimates .\u00a0</p>\n<p>A central problem in assessing the impact of malaria is the identification of a suitable indicator for the prevalence of the disease. The most severely affected countries often lack high-quality data on disease burden of malaria. As such, researchers use historical maps of the geographical distribution of malarial risk to derive an index of malaria prevalence (Cutler, 2010). Therefore, the malaria index is a variable that is dependent on the accuracy of the model that the economist used to \u2018map\u2019 its effect, and its accuracy is to a large extend debatable.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the study on the mining companies in Zambia might demonstrate some substantially positive\u00a0 results of malaria eradication on growth and productivity but it\u2019s highly uncertain if it would have worked that well for another mining industry in another country\u00a0 or at a different time period.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Conclusion_\">Conclusion </strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To conclude, analyzing malaria\u2019s\u00a0 long-term effects on economic growth and labor productivity is a rather challenging task.

I see this happen all too frequently. To correct this mistake, I'm going to tell a little story.</p>\n<p><a></a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Once upon a time, there was a village of peaceful immortal humans. They did not age past their primes, but they could still die from starvation or injury. But perhaps because their lives were so long and full, they all valued each other very highly and lived in peace. Indeed, there were no lengths to which the villagers would not go in order to save one of their fellows from unwanted annihilation.</p>\n<p>Or, at least, that's how life was before the dragon came.</p>\n<p>Dragons desire two things from people, as I'm sure you know: gold, and flesh. And this dragon, woe be upon the villagers, was powerful indeed \u2014 nigh invincible, with a cunning to match. The dragon, easily capable of killing the entire village outright, gave a grim ultimatum:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each person in this village must pay a tax of gold, every year, in proportion to that person's age. Anyone who cannot pay the tax will be eaten.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The villagers begged and pleaded, they wept and raged, but the dragon was unmoved. It merely showed them a few heaps of rock that looked likely to make good gold mines, and told them to get to work.</p>\n<p>The villagers tried their best. They really did. They were not miners, but they were fast learners. They worked themselves ragged, throwing aside stones, digging at the earth with their bare hands until their fingers bled, hunting and gathering as little as possible, letting their shelters deteriorate \u2014 yet still, they could not make the dragon's tax. At the end of a year, the dragon returned, and took all the gold they had, and ten of the oldest villagers (for giving up the eldest villagers was the way to save the most lives).</p>\n<p>Distraught, the villagers resolved to try harder next time. They pushed themselves to their limits and beyond. They raced against time. They grew gaunt and ragged. Their eyes sank, their skin grew sallow, their arms thinned. They pushed themselves too hard, until they were collapsing in the mines. The next time the dragon came, it took all their gold and fifty of their number.</p>\n<p>Their strategy wasn't working.</p>\n<p>But these villagers were born of humanity, and ingenuity is humanity's birthright. So in their third year, the surviving villagers came to bitter terms with their situation, and set to hunting and gathering and growing stronger, accepting that they had to take care of themselves before they could take care of their friends. They set to building picks and shovels, realizing that they could not save themselves with their hands alone.</p>\n<p>At the end of the third year, the dragon took all their gold and one hundred of their number, for their infrastructure had not yet started paying off.</p>\n<p>But by the end of the fourth year, the dragon only took two.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, the dragon (delighted by their progress) informed the villagers that the tax would now begin increasing faster; exponentially in age.</p>\n<p>This time, the villagers only nodded, and forged their hot fury into cold resolve.</p>\n<p>It has been many, many years since the dragon came to the village. In fact, it is not a village any more: the village grew to a city, and the city grew to a civilization.</p>\n<p>The population is quite a bit younger now. The elders are wiser and more productive, and can get more gold out of the ground per hour, but there simply comes a time when this increased productivity is not worth the cost in lives. When that time comes, the elders go willingly to their fate, for these people are not the type to buy their own lives at the cost of two others.</p>\n<p>In fact, hard tradeoffs such as these are commonplace. The villagers long ago discovered specialization and economics, and now most of them don't work in the mines. Some of them spend time growing or preparing food, others spend time maintaining shelter, others spend time inventing new tools and mechanisms that can keep pace with the dragon's dreadful tax. Indeed, some spend their lives on art and entertainment \u2014 for the villagers have learned the importance of maintaining motivation and morale.</p>\n<p>(And some villagers, deep underground, far from the dragon's prying eyes, are designing weapons.)</p>\n<p>So you will find, in this civilization, that there are people who dedicate their lives not to mining gold, but to writing books \u2014 but if you look closely, you'll notice that this only happens when the author can save <em>more</em> lives through increased morale and productivity than they can through working in the mines directly. And so this civilization, hellbent on saving as many people as it can every year, still produces books and plays and movies.</p>\n<p>Which means that in modern times, you can calculate the exact cost of saving an additional life. It turns out that one life goes for about the same price as a thousand movie tickets.</p>\n<p>As it happens, two of the citizens of this dragon-ridden world, Alice and Bob, are having a conversation about the value of a life, right now. Let's listen in:</p>\n<p><strong>Alice:</strong> So you see, the true value of a life is equivalent to about a thousand views on the latest blockbuster.</p>\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Nonsense! A life is worth much more than two thousand hours of movie-viewing! A life is nigh invaluable! You can't put a price tag on a human life!</p>\n<p><strong>Alice:</strong> What hollow indignation! If your actions are inconsistent with putting a price tag on life, then there are ways you could shuffle money around to save more lives. If you want to save as many people as possible with a limited amount of money, then you <em>must</em> put a price on life!</p>\n<p><strong>Bob:</strong> But a thousand viewings of a movie simply isn't worth the same as a life! If I got to choose between a thousand people watching another blockbuster and the life of my mother, I'd choose the life of my mother any day!</p>\n<p><strong>Alice:</strong> Yes, but this intuition is inconsistent. The market for lives here is effecient, and the market has spoken, and the market says that a life is equal to about a thousand views of the latest blockbuster. Your mother's life <em>isn't</em> worth more than the accumulated pleasure that a thousand people experience when watching the latest blockbuster! The viewing experience and your mother's life just turn out to have the same value, and if your intuition disagrees, you'll have to fix your intuition!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Do you see the errors here?</p>\n<p>Alice and Bob are both right, and both wrong.</p>\n<p>Alice is correct in that the villagers <em>must</em> treat a life as equivalent to a few thousand hours worth of watching movies. Given that the villagers are all still trying to save each other, those thousand people only go to the movies if the resulting boost in motivation and morale leads them to collectively generate enough additional wealth to save <em>more</em> than one additional person. If you stopped those people going to the movies, and put their money towards producing gold instead, then <em>less</em> gold would be produced overall, and more people would die. Bob <em>must</em> trade off two thousand movie-hours against one life, if he wants to maximize lives saved.</p>\n<p>But Bob is correct in that the value of a life is worth much more than two thousand hours of viewing movies!</p>\n<p>Alice's claim is that the <em>sum experience</em> of two thousand movie-hours is equal to the intrinsic value of a life. The market has spoken, and so you must not protest, if you want to save lives.</p>\n<p>But in fact, the very reason that Bob must treat the thousand movie-viewings as equivalent to a life is because those viewings lead to increased morale, which leads to <em>more than one life being saved.</em> This fact <em>does not</em> equate the experience of a life lived to the pleasure of the viewers.</p>\n<p>What Alice has forgotten is that the village is <em>plagued by a dragon.</em></p>\n<p>Were it not for the dragon, these villagers would go to almost any lengths to save each other from unwanted death. There might be <em>some</em> lengths to which they would not go, <em>some</em> price they would not pay, in pain, sorrow, and decreased quality of life among the rest of the villagers, in order to save a friend. But, in the absence of a dragon, this cost would be a <em>hell of a lot higher</em> than two-thousand hours worth of watching movies.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Enough analogies. Let's look at our universe, now. Our economy is <em>not</em> efficient \u2014 it costs a few million dollars to save a life in developed nations, and a few thousand dollars to save a life in underdeveloped nations (where \"save a life\" really only means \"push death back a bit\", in these dark times). Furthermore, our economy is <em>not</em> maximizing for lives: humans are prone to scope insensitivity and a whole slew of other biases that <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/on-caring/\">dampen their ability to care</a> about other humans dying against their will. Furthermore, it is important to care not only about the lives we save, but about the lives we <em>live</em>.</p>\n<p>Despite all this, we are not all that different from those villagers in the lengths we would go to save each other if death was not inevitable.</p>\n<p>I don't know how the future will turn out. I don't know how we'll end up trading off the preservation of a life against the improvement of a life against the creation of a life, if and when we make it past this phase of scarcity. But I can tell you this: <em>There may well come a day when humanity would tear apart a thousand suns in order to prevent a single untimely death.</em></p>\n<p><em>That</em> is the value of a life.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>You still have to put a price tag on lives, and that price tag still has to somewhere between a few thousand dollars and a few million dollars.</p>\n<p>Imagine a button which, when pressed, picks a random number between 1 and a million. If that number is 1, it kills a randomly selected person. How much would somebody have to pay you to press that button?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://squid314.livejournal.com/260949.html\">Many people react with disgust, saying they wouldn't press such a button at any price.</a> They say that the value of a life is nigh inconceivable.</p>\n<p><em>And this intuition is correct!</em></p>\n<p>But when somebody offers you ten dollars to press that button, press it anyway. Press it, and worry about it less than you worry about driving a car for a year (which, if I did my math right, is like pressing a button that has a one in ten thousand chance of killing somebody each year, in return for the convenience of driving [<a href=\"http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx\">1</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm\">2</a>]). If you want to save the most lives, then you press that button for $10, and you put the money towards saving lives.</p>\n<p><em>But don't confuse the cost of a life with the value of a life!</em></p>\n<p>In some parts of this world, it costs as little as a few thousand dollars to save a life. If you act like the price on a life is higher than a few thousand dollars, if you <em>actually</em> refuse a million dollars to press the button, or pay a billion dollars to save a single life, then there were other things you could have done to save more lives. If you want to save the most people, you <em>must</em> put a price tag on life according to the <em>actual</em> cost of saving a life.</p>\n<p>But you don't have to confuse the <em>current cost of saving a life</em> with the <em>intrinsic value of a life.</em></p>\n<p>There is a gap there. There is a gap between how much a life is <em>really worth</em>, and the price tag that you <em>must assign.</em> That gap is not there because your intuitions are wrong. That gap is there because <em>our village is being plagued by a godamn dragon.</em></p>\n<p><em>That gap is a direct measure of the difference between the universe that is, and the universe that should be.</em></p>\n<p>That price difference, the difference between a few thousand dollars and a few thousand suns, is a direct measure of how fucked up things are.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Most people start with an intuition that they should refuse to press the button at any price, because lives are nigh invaluable. You can go to these people, and show them that in order to save as many lives as possible with a bounded amount of money, they must put a price on life. Most people, at that point, react one of two ways.</p>\n<p>Some accept the logic and reject their intuitions. They see that, to save the most lives, they <em>must</em> use a price tag. It sounds repugnant to say that the pleasure experienced by a few million people drinking a can of soda is equivalent to the value of a life, but (they think) that's exactly the sort of reasoning that leads someone to thinking that life is invaluable, which is a deadly misconception. And so, wanting to save as many people as they can with the money allotted to life-saving, they bite the bullet, and conclude that lives were never worth all that much anyway.</p>\n<p>Others reject the logic, and continue to claim that life is invaluable, and then try to back up their intuitions with some strange version of ethics where saving as many lives as possible with the money available is not the right thing to do, for convoluted reasons.</p>\n<p>But there's a third option here! All these people have forgotten about the dragon!</p>\n<p>It is possible to live in a universe where it is <em>both</em> the case that (1) lives are nigh invaluable, and (2) people are being annihilated constantly, against their will, in ways that can be prevented using relatively small sums of money.</p>\n<p>The universe is not fair! Pressing the button for $10 is the way to save the most lives, <em>and this very fact is a horrible thing.</em> Lives are nigh invaluable, <em>but you have to treat them as if they're worth only a few thousand dollars.</em></p>\n<p>This gap between price and value is <em>unacceptable,</em> but physics wasn't written according to what we would accept. We live in a cold, uncaring universe; a universe <a href=\"http://so8r.es/stories/BeyondTheReachOfGod.pdf\">beyond the reach of God</a>.</p>\n<p>One day, we may slay the dragons that plague us. One day we, like the villagers in their early days, may have the luxury of going to any length in order to prevent a fellow sentient mind from being condemned to oblivion unwillingly. If we ever make it that far, the worth of a life will be measured not in dollars, but in <em>stars</em>.</p>\n<p><em>That</em> is the value of a life. It will be the value of a life then, and it is the value of a life <em>now.</em></p>\n<p>So when somebody offers $10 to press that button, you press it. You press the hell out of it. It's the best strategy available to you; it's the only way to save as many people as you can. <em>But don't ever forget that this very fact is a terrible tragedy.</em></p>\n<p>Don't ever forget about the gap between how little a life costs and how much a life is worth. For that gap is an account of the darkness in this universe, it is a measure of how very far we have left to go.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I don't want to turn this into a sermon. But some of you, seeing the great abyss between cost and worth clearly for the first time, may decide that this gap is worth closing, that our dragons are dragons are worth slaying. Some of you may be wondering, what now? What next? This last part is for you.</p>\n<p>Know that there are those of us who fight.</p>\n<p>Some of us <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">work in the mines</a> to <a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/\">make the dragon's tax</a>. Others <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">prepare for the day we will confront the dragon</a> \u2014 for the weapons we must bring to bear will be powerful indeed, <a href=\"http://intelligence.org\">and may prove difficult to aim</a>.</p>\n<p>And this is a fight you can join. For some of you, fighting means joining an effective cause. But for most of you, fighting means putting a low price tag on lives, and then honoring it \u2014 by purchasing lives wherever they are cheapest; by donating to highly effective causes. Remember that just as courage is about doing the right thing even though you're afraid, <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/on-caring/\">caring is about doing the right thing even when you're not overwhelmed by emotion</a>.</p>\n<p>If this is a fight you wish to join, then I urge you to remember the first lesson that the villagers learned: you must care for yourself before you care for others. You do not need to become destitute to struggle against the darkness in this universe. Any small amount of money or effort you can put towards saving lives is money and effort well spent. <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/19/nobody-is-perfect-everything-is-commensurable/\">Pledging 10% of your earnings to an effective cause is a difficult achievement worthy of great acclaim</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are going to stand beside us in this fight, then I will welcome you no matter what \u2014 but I would rather you join us filled with hot fury or cold resolve, rather than with guilt or shame.</p>\n<p>Oh, Death was never an enemy of ours!<br> We laughed with him, we leagued with him, old chum.<br> No soldier's paid to kick against his powers.<br> We laughed, knowing that better men would come,<br> And greater wars; when each proud fighter brags<br> He wars on Death, for lives; not men, for flags.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Final stanza of <em>The Next War</em>, by Wilfred Owen</p>\n<p><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "3rd Jan 2015", "title": "A taxonomy of EA origin stories", "author": "Tom_Ash", "num_comments": "12 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>As suggested by Peter Hurford, the topic for January's <a href=\"/ea/bp/figuring_good_out_launch_thread/\">EA blogging carnival</a> is EA origin stories. I've always enjoyed hearing these, both for their inherent human interest and for what they reveal about ways to get people into EA, and the sorts of people who are receptive to it. So here are some common sorts of origin stories, based on accounts people have given me and the answers people gave in <a href=\"http://survey.effectivealtruismhub.com/?s=t-eaf-030115\">last year's EA survey</a>. I also give the raw figures from the survey. If you fit into one of these categories I'd love to hear from you in comments - and if you haven't yet <a href=\"http://survey.effectivealtruismhub.com/?s=t-eaf-030115\">taken the survey</a> it would be valuable to get your answers via this!\u00a0</p>\n<p>EA origin stories typically have two elements. One is how people first heard about the term or the community; the other is what convinced them of EA ideas. Many EAs I've spoken to about this - I think a majority - were already sold on EA ideas before hearing the term. A significant fraction knew them under another label, such as 'utilitarianism' or 'utilitarian or Singerite ideas about charity' - I was one of these. There was an active community discussing them on the utilitarian forum <a href=\"http://felicifia.org/\">Felicifia</a>.</p>\n<p>In the EA survey we had two separate questions asking about these two elements. The first was \"How did you first hear about 'Effective Altruism'?\". This was a single choice question, which was explicitly about the <em>term</em>\u00a0'Effective Altruism', although several people interpreted it \u00a0as being about EA ideas. (I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts about what the most interesting such questions would be for this year's survey.) The second question was \"Which factors were important in 'getting you into' Effective Altruism, or altering your actions in its direction?\" This was a multiple choice question.</p>\n<p>The kinds of EA origin story that I list below can apply to either of these questions. Some will explain how people heard about the term EA more often than they explain how they got convinced by EA ideas, and for some the opposite will hold.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_list_of_origins\">The list of origins</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Friends\"><span>Friends</span></h3>\n<p><strong></strong><span>This category can be split into people who were </span><em>convinced</em><span>\u00a0of effective altruism by friends and those who merely heard the term from them, but were already on board with the ideas or were easily sold on them.\u00a0</span><span>126 survey respondents reported first hearing about EA from friends, 237 said personal contact was important in getting them into it, and 196 said the same of friends or family. Note that since the question about the factors that were important in getting people into EA was multiple choice, there was some overlap between the last two categories.</span></p>\n<p><span>This category overlaps with some of the others below; for example, some people who got into EA through local groups made friends in these groups, and these friendships were sometimes more important than the other activities of the group. Some survey respondents in this boat likely only picked the 'local groups' option, so the numbers above will be underestimates.</span></p>\n<p><span>I'm an example of someone who heard about EA (before the term) from a friend - <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/pablo-stafforini\">Pablo Stafforini</a> - but was already fully on board with the ideas, for example planning to give a large proportion of my income to effective charities. <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/lucas-zamprogno\">Lucas Zamprogno</a> is an example of someone who got on board partly due to an existing friendship (in his case with <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/joey-savoie\">Joey Savoie</a>).</span></p>\n<h3 id=\"People_who_came_to_EA_conclusions_independently\"><span>People who came to EA conclusions independently</span></h3>\n<p><span>There is some ambiguity in what this category means. Of course, no one reaches EA conclusions in a vacuum, and we are all influenced by the universe of ideas and arguments that we encounter. So the interesting questions are really to what extent people came across preformed EA ideas (for example through reading about them in Peter Singer's writings or an EA blog), and to what extent they convinced themselves of them rather than hearing persuasive arguments from others.</span></p>\n<p><span>These are not easy questions to settle. For example, utilitarianism involves or implies several EA principles, so arguably someone who came to EA via encountering utilitarianism did not arrive at it independently. But saying this seems too strict, because someone who accepts utilitarianism and derives EA ideas from it has done a lot of the work themselves, compared to someone who becomes an EA through, say, reading the <a href=\"/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/\">introductory articles on this forum</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>I know many people who came to EA via utilitarianism, myself included, so my impression is that a lot of EAs fall into this category. It's hard to get numbers from the EA survey, but some of the answers people gave for the ways in which they first heard the term suggest they are examples of this. For example, 13 people said they heard about it through internet searches, and presumably some of them were searching for others convinced of positions that they already accepted. I know that this was the case for\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/joey-savoie\">Joey Savoie</a>. Likewise, the most common reported way for people to hear about EA was LessWrong (with 257 survey respondents picking this option). LessWrong readers will encounter arguments for EA, so it's hard to estimate how many of them were already convinced of it, but my impression is that if you find LessWrong you're likely to already share a certain perspective rather than getting convinced of it through reading.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Local_groups\"><strong>Local groups</strong></h3>\n<p>Local groups are a major form of EA outreach on the part of grassroots EAs (and of EA organisations, insofar as some groups brand themselves as chapters of these). There are <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/groups\">52 listed on the EA Hub</a>, with more groups steadily creating pages there. Despite this only 12 survey respondents reported first hearing about EA through a group, and only 97 said one was important in getting them involved. However, these figures may be an underestimate, because some people will have picked out an EA organisation instead when they got involved through a chapter of this. For example, 82 people said they first heard about EA through GWWC, 42 through GiveWell, 41 through 80,000 Hours, and 38 through The Life You Can Save. These are still pretty low numbers however.</p>\n<h3 id=\"EA_organisations__blogs_and_online_communities\">EA organisations, blogs and online communities</h3>\n<p>Many people may have come to EA conclusions independently, but they had to hear the term independently, and if it wasn't through a friend or local groups, it was likely via reading about it. One place to do so is on a website or blog, such as that of an EA organisation, or the broad EA blogosphere, including LessWrong and this very forum. Some of the people who reported hearing about EA through an organisation - listed above - presumably fall into this category. And significantly more people (257) reported hearing about it through LessWrong, such as <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/david-perry\">David Perry</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/alice-monday\">Alice Monday</a>.</p>\n<p>GiveWell is notable here in that relatively few people reported first hearing about EA through it - perhaps because it does not use the term often - but it was the second most common factor in getting people more involved after LessWrong, playing an important role for 267 people. It is after all what many of us rely on in choosing charities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Media_reporting\">Media reporting</h3>\n<p>Besides the EA blogosphere, effective altruism has also been reported on by mainstream media with a very large reach. However I haven't personally heard of anyone getting involved in EA through this, and only a handful of people reported doing so in the survey.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Peter_Singer\">Peter Singer</h3>\n<p>Peter Singer is arguably the world's most famous effective altruist, and has an enormous reach among both philosophy students and the general public. His TED talk alone has had 1.1 million reported views on the TED website, and 43 survey respondents reported hearing about EA through it, including <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/kelly-atlas\">Kelly Atlas</a> and <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/jim-greenbaum\">Jim Greenbaum</a>. A few also singled out Singer as important in getting them into EA, such as <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/michael-dickens\">Michael Dickens</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Other_social_movements\">Other social movements</h3>\n<p>EAs sometimes identified with other social movements beforehand, and some were heavily involved in these. Not many people mentioned these as parts of their origin stories in the survey, but we did ask what movements people identified with. 311 said animal rights, 390 said environmentalism, 669 said rationalist/LessWrong, 374 said transhumanism, and 601 said skepticism/atheism. Presumably many of these did not come to EA through these movements. However, I have heard of people doing so, in particular through rationalism, skepticism and atheism. Of note, the Swiss EA group initially colonised some university freethought societies.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_raw_figures_from_the_EA_survey\">The raw figures from the EA survey</h2>\n<p>As a reminder, Peter Hurford and the survey analysis team will be releasing the full results for this soon, but by way of a sneak peak here are the figures for the questions discussed above.</p>\n<h3 id=\"How_did_you_first_hear_about__Effective_Altruism__\">How did you first hear about 'Effective Altruism'?</h3>\n<p>LessWrong<br> 257<br> Friend<br> 126<br> GWWC<br> 82<br> TLYCS<br> 38<br> TED Talk (Peter Singer)<br> 43<br> GiveWell<br> 42<br> 80K<br> 41<br> Facebook<br> 35<br> Search<br> 13<br> Local Group<br> 12<br> Swiss EAs<br> 9<br> CEA<br> 9<br> Leverage<br> 4<br> Felicifia<br> 3<br> CFAR<br> 3<br> ACE<br> 3<br> THINK<br> 1</p>\n<h3 id=\"Which_factors_were_important_in__getting_you_into__Effective_Altruism__or_altering_your_actions_in_its_direction_\">Which factors were important in 'getting you into' Effective Altruism, or altering your actions in its direction?</h3>\n<p>LessWrong<br> 316<br> GiveWell<br> 267<br> Personal contact<br> 237<br> Friends/Family<br> 196<br> GWWC<br> 180<br> 80K<br> 150<br> Online EAs<br> 144<br> Peter Singer (including TED Talk and TLYCS)<br> 113<br> Local group<br> 97</p>\n<h2 id=\"What_was_your_origin_story_\">What was your origin story?</h2>\n<p>As I mentioned above, I'd love to hear your origin stories in comments, and if you haven't yet\u00a0<a href=\"http://survey.effectivealtruismhub.com/?s=t-eaf-030115\">taken the EA survey</a>\u00a0it would be valuable to get your answers via this.

Within health interventions, it is natural to allocate marginal spending to avert the most expected DALYs (disability adjusted life-years) per dollar.</p>\n<p>However, not all DALYs are the same and there are important differences between years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). Not accounting for these categories separately may introduce a bias in decision-making because DALYs do not address non-health outcomes for individuals and the effects of outcomes on others. These effects are different in situations which involve primarily YLLs as opposed to YLDs. This analysis is of particular practical importance to effective altruists because two of the most promising interventions address different types of DALYS \u2013 deworming primarily averts YLDs and bed nets to prevent malaria primarily avert YLLs.\u00a0This make us more inclined towards deworming as a top intervention than a naive evaluation would suggest. More sophisticated analyses incorporate terms that address many of these effects, but may still undervalue deworming relative to malaria nets.</p>\n<p>This document is primarily written for people who already place a high weight on DALYs in identifying top public health opportunities. It does not argue for the use of DALYs, or consequentialist reasoning in identifying public health opportunities.</p>\n<p>You can view the full article <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/03/ylds-and-ylls/\">here.</a></p></div></div>"},

Google entered <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/14/us-autoshow-google-urmson-idUSKBN0KN29820150114\">discussions last month</a> with major car manufacturers about getting production lines rolling within the next two to five years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/modeledbehavior/2014/11/08/the-massive-economic-benefits-of-self-driving-cars/\">Pundits </a><a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052014/how-googles-selfdriving-car-will-change-everything.asp\">gush </a>about the potential benefits, but the effect of driverless cars helping us build a legislative framework for future automation technologies, though often <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/5/28/5756736/the-case-for-self-driving-cars\">seen as a challenge</a>, may be a huge opportunity.</p>\n<p>Many of the benefits of self-driving cars are well known. First, car crashes kill a lot of people. 1,700 people die in traffic accidents each year in Britain and worldwide the total is 1.2 million\u00b9, almost as many as die from HIV/AIDS. These are overwhelmingly caused by human error, and it seems likely that the technology could soon become reliable enough to eliminate a large proportion of these.</p>\n<p>Second, people spend a lot of time driving. Some of this is enjoyed, but much is merely endured. Freeing people to use their travel time in work, study or leisure would be a substantial boost to the economy and to wellbeing. Moreover, the effects on congestion, emissions and accessibility could be substantial.</p>\n<p>But there is another big reason to push ahead adopting driverless cars that gets neglected. We are living in a world of increasing automation. We need to adapt to that: technically, legally, and socially. Self-driving cars seem like a big step today, but we can expect much greater automation in our lifetimes, for example in medical diagnosis. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150109185039/http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf\">A recent paper</a> estimates that around half of current jobs in developed economies may be automated away in the coming decades.</p>\n<p>We have a lot to learn. How can we produce systems which are robust to unknown errors in their code? Which are resistant to any remote sabotage? How we can structure our laws so that liability is clear when things fail? How can we structure the incentives so that it is in everyone\u2019s interest to prevent them from failing? What new areas of employment can we create to take advantage of this liberation of human time and expertise?</p>\n<p>All of these will take time, and will almost certainly not be done right from the beginning.The longer we wait on grappling with the practical issues that driverless cars present, the longer before we get an opportunity for our society to adapt to the next great force to shape humanity. That will make us less prepared for future increases in automation, which may be much more dramatic and essential to get right. If this were the last time we had to face this challenge, it might make sense to take things slowly. But because there is so much yet to come, the societal knowledge we gain from experimentation is very valuable.</p>\n<p>Slowing things down now might make it easier for us in the short term. It is likely, however, that it will make it harder for society to adapt to a more sudden and alarming change in the future, when we can no longer hold back the rising tide of technology.</p>\n<p><small> </small></p>\n<p><small>Endnotes:</small></p>\n<p><small> </small> <small> </small></p>\n<p><small>1 The UK figure, from the Department for Transport, is from their 2013 annual report as 2014 data have not yet been finalised.

{"date": "30th Jan 2015", "title": "Effective Altruism and Utilitarianism", "author": "Tom_Ash", "num_comments": "55 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span>I think it\u2019d be interesting to discuss the relationship between effective altruism and utilitarianism (or <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/\">consequentialism</a> more broadly). These are my initial reflections on the topic, intended as a launching point for discussion rather than a comprehensive survey. (Despite the five years I spent studying philosophy - before deciding that this didn\u2019t actually help anyone! - </span><span>this post is</span><span>\u00a0focused on practicalities rather than precise analysis, though I\u2019d enjoy hearing that too.)</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"A_classification_of_EA_views\"><span>A classification of EA views</span></h2>\n<p><span>EAs often say that their views don\u2019t presuppose </span><span>consequentialism</span><span>\u00a0(in its classic form, the view that an act is right if and only if it results in at least as much expected good as any other available act). And this is true for a wide range of characteristically EA views, such as that giving </span><span><a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/donations\">large sums</a></span><span>\u00a0(say </span><span>10% of your income</span><span>) to </span><span><a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/actions/donating\">charities ranked as highly cost-effective</a></span><span>\u00a0is a good thing. </span><span>However it is not true for other views which some regard as part of EA, such as that small chances of astronomical effects on the sorts of lives that are brought about in the future can overwhelm any effects your actions have on people who exist now.</span><span>\u00a0</span><span>This may not logically presuppose consequentialism, but it is generally based on it. On many moral views people who don\u2019t exist - and especially people who wouldn\u2019t exist but for your actions - don\u2019t matter morally in the same way as people who do. So it is helpful to divide EA beliefs into these three categories:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Those that are probably true even if consequentialism is false</span></li>\n<li><span>Those that are probably false - sometimes even repugnant! - on non-consequentialist views</span></li>\n<li><span>Those that fall into neither of the above categories (it will be a toss-up whether these beliefs are true </span><span>even if </span><span>consequentialism is false).</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Which category a belief</span><span>\u00a0</span><span>falls into is important. One uncontroversial reason for this is that many people are not consequentialists and that we want to convince them. Beliefs in category 1 will be the easiest sell, followed by those in category 3; beliefs in category 2 will be a tough sell.</span></p>\n<p><span>Another reason is that consequentialism may be false. The importance of this possibility depends upon the probability we assign to it, but it must carry </span><span>some</span><span>\u00a0weight unless it can be rejected absolutely, </span><span>which is only plausible on the most extreme forms of </span><span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_subjectivism\">moral subjectivism</a></span><span>. I do not find these views credible, but going into this would be a digression, so I\u2019ll simply flag that moral subjectivists will have a different perspective on this.</span><span>\u00a0I\u2019ve also found that some other </span><span><a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/\">anti-realists</a></span><span>\u00a0are extremely confident (though not certain) that consequentialism is true, though it\u2019s an open question how often this is reasonable.</span></p>\n<p><span>When we\u2019re concerned with convincing non-consequentialists, we will focus on the particular non-consequentialist positions that they hold, which will generally be those that are most popular. When we\u2019re concerned with the possibility that consequentialism is false, by contrast, we should really care about whether the EA views at issue are true or false on the non-consequentialist theories that we find most </span><span>plausible</span><span>\u00a0rather than on the theories that are most </span><span>popular</span><span>. For instance, if you think that you might owe special duties to family members then this is relevant regardless of how popular that position is. </span><span>(That said, its very popularity may make you find it more plausible, as you may wish to avoid overconfidently rejecting moral claims that many thoughtful people </span><span>accept</span><span>.)</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"Which_categories_do_EA_views_fall_into_\"><span>Which categories do EA views fall into?</span></h2>\n<p><span>The answer to this question depends on what non-consequentialist positions we are talking about. I\u2019ll consider a few in turn.</span></p>\n<p><span>First, take the position that people who don\u2019t exist have less moral weight. </span><span>There are several versions of this position, each with different implications. On one version, only people who exist matter at all; this would make far future oriented charities less promising. On another, people who don\u2019t yet exist matter less; the implications of this depend on how much less, but in some cases effects on non-existent people won\u2019t alter which charities are most effective. On yet another, certain </span><span>sorts</span><span>\u00a0of people matter less - for example, those who won\u2019t exist because you acted a certain way. This example would affect our evaluation of existential risk charities.</span></p>\n<p><span>Second, there are a wide variety of positions which directly or indirectly reduce the relative moral weight of animals, or of people who don\u2019t currently exist. Consequentialism (and in particular <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/#ClaUti\">classical utilitarianism</a>, or some aspects thereof) is plausibly the moral theory that is friendliest to them. </span><span>For example, when it focuses on pleasure and pain it puts concern for animals on the strongest possible ground, since it is in their capacity to feel pain that animals are closest to us</span><span>. </span><span>So we should expect animals\u2019 moral weight to decrease if we give some credence to these positions. </span></p>\n<p><span>A third sort of non-consequentialist position is that we should not act wrongly in certain ways even if the results of doing so appear positive in a purely consequentialist calculus. On this position we should not treat our ends as justifying absolutely any means. Examples of prohibited means could be any of the adjectives or nouns commonly associated with wrongdoing: dishonesty, unfairness, cruelty, theft, et cetera. This view has strong intuitive force. And even if we don\u2019t straightforwardly accept it, it\u2019s hard not to think that a sensitivity to the badness of this sort of behaviour is a good thing, </span><span>as is a rule of thumb prohibiting them</span><span>\u00a0- something that many consequentialists accept.</span></p>\n<p><span>It would be naive to suppose that effective altruists are immune to acting in these wrong ways - after all, they\u2019re not always motivated by being unusually nice or moral people. Indeed, effective altruism </span><span>makes</span><span>\u00a0some people more likely to act like this by providing </span><span>ready-made rationalisations which treat them as working towards overwhelming important ends, and indeed as vastly important figures whose productivity must be bolstered at all costs</span><span>. </span><span>I\u2019ve seen prominent EAs use these justifications for actions that would shock people in more normal circles. I shouldn\u2019t give specific examples that are not already in the public domain. But some of you will remember a Facebook controversy about something (allegedly and contestedly) said at the 2013 EA Summit, though I think it\u2019d be fairest not to describe it in the comments. And there are also attitudes that are sufficiently common to not be personally identifiable, such as that one\u2019s life as an important EA is worth that of at least 20 \u201cnormal\u201d people.</span></p>\n<p><span>A fourth and final non-consequentialist position to consider is that you owe special duties to family members or others who are close to you, and perhaps also to those with whom you have looser relations, such as your fellow citizens. This may limit the resources that you should devote to effective altruism, depending on how these duties are to be weighed. It may give you </span><span>permission to favour your near and dear. </span><span>However, it seems implausible that it generally makes it </span><span>wrong</span><span>\u00a0to donate 10% of your income, though a non-consequentialist friend did once argue this to me</span><span>\u00a0(saying that taking aunts out for fancy meals should take priority)</span><span>. </span></p>\n<p><span>An important question about this position is how the special duties it refers to are to be weighed against EA actions. It may be that the case for these actions is so overwhelming - because of contingent facts about the way the world happens to be, with severe poverty that can be alleviated astonishingly cheaply - that they significantly reduce the call of these duties. The sheer scale of the good that we can do does seem to provide unusually strong reasons for action. However to assume that this scale is decisive would be to fail to take the possibility that consequentialism is false seriously, because non-consequentialists are not concerned only with scale.</span></p>\n<p><span>Taking a step back, it\u2019s worth noting that in the above I\u2019ve focused on the ways in which </span><span>some</span><span>\u00a0effective altruists could go wrong if consequentialism is false. The outlook for effective altruism in general is still quite positive in this case. On most non-consequentialist views, effective altruist actions generally range from being supererogatory (good, but beyond the call of duty) to being morally neutral. These views generally consider giving to charity good and would consider taking this to EA lengths at worst misplaced, not seriously morally wrong (unless you seriously neglect those for whom you are responsible). They would hardly consider concern for animals\u2019 wellbeing morally wrong either, even if animals have a significantly lower moral status than humans.</span></p>\n<p><span>Ironically, the worst these views would generally say about effective altruism is that it suffers from high opportunity costs. Having mistaken what matters, an effective altruist would not pursue it effectively. But these views generally consider that supererogatory, so again the picture is not so bad. (I owe these points to Gregory Lewis.)</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"What_s_your_take_\"><span>What\u2019s your take?</span></h2>\n<p><span>I\u2019d love to hear people\u2019s take on these issues, and on the relationship between effective altruism and consequentialism more broadly, which I certainly haven\u2019t covered comprehensively. Which of the non-consequentialist positions above do you find most plausible, and what are the implications of this? And are there other non-consequentialist positions that would have implications for effective altruists?</span></p>\n<p><span><em>(I would like to thank Theron Pummer, Gregory Lewis and Jonas M\u00fcller for helpful comments.)</em></span></p></div></div>"},

It\u2019s a big job that requires organization, initiative, technical chops, and superlative communication skills. You\u2019ll develop, improve, and manage the processes and systems that make us an effective organization.

Experts largely agree that AI is likely to exceed human levels of capability on most cognitive tasks in this century\u2014but it\u2019s not clear <em>when</em>, and we aren\u2019t doing a very good job of preparing for the possibility. Given how disruptive smarter-than-human AI would be, we need to start thinking now about AI\u2019s global impact. Over the past year, a number of leaders in science and industry have voiced their support for prioritizing this endeavor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stuart Russell, co-author of the leading <a href=\"http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/\">textbook</a> on artificial intelligence and a MIRI advisor, has given a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYQrNfSmQ0M\">compelling argument</a> for doing this work sooner rather than later.</li>\n<li>Nick Bostrom, another MIRI research advisor, published <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199678111/\">Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies</a></em>, which details the potential value of smarter-than-human AI systems as well as the potential hazards.</li>\n<li>Elon Musk (SpaceX, Tesla), Bill Gates (Microsoft co-founder), Stephen Hawking (world-renowned theoretical physicist), and others have publicly stated their concerns about long-term AI risk.</li>\n<li>Hundreds of AI researchers and engineers recently signed an <a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/misc/open_letter\">open letter</a> advocating for more research into robust and beneficial artificial intelligence.

As interest in AI safety grows, we\u2019re growing too\u2014we\u2019ve gone from a single full-time researcher in 2013 to what will likely be a half-dozen research fellows by the end of 2015, and intend to continue growing in 2016.</p>\n<p>All of which is to say: we <em>really need</em> an office manager who will support our efforts to hack away at the problem of superintelligence alignment!</p>\n<p>If our overall mission seems important to you, and you love running well-oiled machines, you\u2019ll probably fit right in.

(That is, your job is not to sit at a desk for 40 hours a week. Your job is to get your important work <em>done</em>, even if this occasionally means working on a weekend or after hours.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If this sounds like your ideal work environment, read on!

An office manager is the oil that keeps the engine running. They\u2019re <em>indispensable</em>. Office managers are force multipliers: a good one doesn\u2019t merely improve their own effectiveness\u2014they make the entire <em>organization</em> better.</p>\n<p>We need you to build, oversee, and improve all the \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d things that ensure MIRI runs smoothly and effortlessly. You will devote your full attention to looking at the big picture and the small details and making sense of it all. You\u2019ll turn all of that into actionable information and tools that make the whole team better. That\u2019s the job.</p>\n<p>Sometimes this looks like researching and testing out new and exciting services. Other times this looks like stocking the fridge with drinks, sorting through piles of mail, lugging bags of groceries, or spending time on the phone on hold with our internet provider. But don\u2019t think that the more tedious tasks are low-value. If the hard tasks don\u2019t get done, <em>none</em> of MIRI\u2019s work is possible.

{"date": "16th Apr 2015", "title": "Explaining impact purchases", "author": "Ben_Kuhn", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>This post originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/impact-purchase\">benkuhn.net</a>. Some readers remarked that it helped them understand impact purchases better, so I'm cross-posting it here.</em></p>\n<p>I'm excited to report that 50% of the impact of my <a href=\"/matching\">donation matching literature review</a> has just <a href=\"http://impactpurchase.org/2015/04/10/first-round-results/\">been purchased</a> in the first round of Paul Christiano and Katja Grace's <a href=\"http://impactpurchase.org/\">impact purchase</a>!</p>\n<p>This means that Paul and Katja now own 50% of the altruistic consequences of the post, so you should consider it only 50% as much of a good deed as you previously did.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Huh_\">Huh?</h3>\n<p>Paul and Katja are purchasing \"certificates of impact,\" which are a philanthropic instrument they invented. It's like funding someone to do something, except that instead of giving them money before they do the thing, you give them money <em>afterwards</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Why_is_that_better_\">Why is that better?</h3>\n<p>It helps to make an analogy to normal tradeable goods.</p>\n<p>Suppose I'm buying a shirt. What I generally do is look at all the shirts that are available and then buy one. (Contrast this with the funding model that's normal for philanthropy, where I would pay someone money for a shirt, and <em>then</em> they would make it.)</p>\n<p>The normal market model puts most of the downside risk of shirt production on the seller. If my tailor runs out of cloth and can't make my shirt after all, then my tailor doesn't get to sell it so my tailor loses the money. This aligns incentives better: my tailor is likely to try harder to make a saleable shirt if they haven't gotten paid for the result yet. (For instance, Kickstarter products might experience fewer production delays and failures if sellers were only paid when their product shipped.)</p>\n<p>An even more important aspect of the normal market model is that it makes it much easier to decide what shirt you want. This isn't such a huge deal for shirts, where it's not so hard to predict <em>ex ante</em> how good the future shirt will be. It's much harder to do that in philanthropic funding!</p>\n<p>There's a much more in-depth explanation of why an impact purchase market would be helpful <a href=\"http://impactpurchase.org/why-certificates/\">on the website</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"How_did_the_process_work_\">How did the process work?</h3>\n<p>I applied through the form on Paul and Katja's website, giving a short description of the blog post, why I thought it had good consequences, and the minimum amount of money for which I would undo the post's impact.</p>\n<p>Then Paul and Katja made their own evaluation of how much each applicant project did, and ran a <a href=\"http://impactpurchase.org/the-auction/\">complicated yet nifty auction process</a> that ensured they would purchase the maximum amount of impact possible while ensuring that I was incentivized to report the true minimum price at which I would be willing to sell the post's impact.</p>\n<p>(The structure of the auction is such that my stated price for the post has no effect on what price Katja and Paul buy it at, only on whether or not it gets purchased. It's pretty cool.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"Isn_t_this_basically_Paul_and_Katja_throwing_money_at_you_for_no_reason__Why_would_you_name_a_minimum_price_greater_than_zero_\">Isn't this basically Paul and Katja throwing money at you for no reason? Why would you name a minimum price greater than zero?</h3>\n<p>It's not free money for me, because I've now been better incentivized to do things that Paul and Katja think are good for the world.</p>\n<p>Well, actually, right now, since Paul and Katja are the only buyers of impact purchases and the market is very thin, I think there's some free money to be had. For instance, if Paul and Katja discontinue the program at the end of the year and nobody else steps up, then the incentives will go away, and nobody will really care that much that once they bought 50% of one of my posts.</p>\n<p>Also, because there are so few entrants right now, impact is getting sold at a substantial markup--according to Paul and Katja's impact evaluations, the price at which they purchased impact from sellers this round was almost double what they could have gotten from donating to GiveWell top charities. But I don't expect that to continue.</p>\n<p>In the long term, though, impact purchases don't involve any money-throwing at all.</p>\n<p>It's easy to think they would, because at first it seems like Paul and Katja aren't really buying anything. The right to claim 50% of my post's impact doesn't seem worth that much because people might not play along. For instance, people might still give me close to 100% of the social status benefits from doing something altruistic.</p>\n<p>But actually, the more important thing Paul and Katja are buying is an incentive for me to do more stuff they'd want to buy in the future. On this view, the point of giving them a claim to the post is to make sure that I can't sell more than 100% of it. (If I could do that, it would distort the market instead and lead to people getting <em>too much</em> incentive to do things.) The public notice that they own half of the consequences is simply a mechanism of enforcing this.</p>\n<p>So in the long term--if the impact purchase market grows--there's a very good reason for me to name a nonzero minimum price for my post, which is that I might think I could sell it later, or to someone else, for more money.</p>\n<h3 id=\"How_was_the_experience__Would_you_do_it_again_\">How was the experience? Would you do it again?</h3>\n<p>Yes! I think the impact purchase program is really cool, and could fill an important gap in what EA projects get funded/properly incentivized to get done. The application was very quick. (And on top of that, I got paid.)</p>\n<p>There's one round of purchases each month, and the next deadline is in a bit over a week on April 25. You should check it out and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1D1PlHNi_7ya9iI1StsR5vSraDvcjTFk-fk-DIUYFtu4/viewform\">apply</a>!</p></div></div>"},

Now think about how far we are from that future.</span><br></p>\n<p><span>I\u2019m willing to bet that It is within our power to bring that future about.

Thus, I propose we build an epic list of every relevant group at every top university and in the world in general.</span><br><br><span><a href=\"http://eaglobal.org/\">EA Global</a> provides some urgency to finish this task soon: marketing the event is an excuse to put up the EA Bat Signal for all of these groups and to get many of them involved. However, this list will also act as a communications backbone for an enormous amount of future projects.</span><br><br><span>I\u2019m not going to lie to you: building this list will be an arduous, tedious task.

Then we screen a bunch of these people for potential EA-ness and then admit them to EA Global. Out of this bunch, let\u2019s say that we get only 1 new EA who becomes a Giving What We Can pledger - a measly conversion rate of less than 0.1%. (Note: I made this conversion rate up as one that could feasibly be far below the conversion rate we might actually get to avoid overselling the project. A less than 0.1% conversion rate would be terrible for most companies.)</span></p>\n<p><span>Today I emailed Giving What We Can\u2019s Michelle Hutchinson for the latest approximation of what adding an average new pledger is worth. Her reply was about $68,000. About how much good does $68,000 yield?

About 50% of people who answered the poll said that they were influenced \"at least in part\" by this reasoning.</p>\n<p>So it sounds like we might have a coordination problem on our hands that causes everyone to wait until the last minute to donate to large fundraisers. Unfortunately, as Rob Wiblin notes, this</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>comes at the cost that we have to put in more time - perhaps a month of staff time - in order to eventually reach our goal.

The following are my notes from an interview with Malo Bourgon (program management analyst and generalist at MIRI) which he reviewed before publishing.</span></p>\n<h4 id=\"Current_talent_needs\"><span>Current talent needs</span></h4>\n<p><span>Since the size of the research team has just doubled, MIRI is not actively looking for new researchers for the next 6 months. However, if you are interested in working at MIRI you should still express your interest.</span></p>\n<p><span>Researchers</span></p>\n<p><span>In the foreseeable future, MIRI is planning to further grow the research team. The main ingredients for a good fit are interest in the problems that MIRI works on and strong talent in math and other quantitative subjects. Being further on the academic career path will therefore naturally help by teaching you more math, but absolutely isn\u2019t necessary.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>One of the best ways to evaluate your fit is to take a look at MIRI\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://intelligence.org/research-guide/\"><span>research guide</span></a><span>. Look at MIRI\u2019s problem areas and study the one that looks most interesting to you. In tandem, grab one of the textbooks to get acquainted with the relevant math. Contrary to what some EAs think, it\u2019s not necessary to understand all of the research guide in order to start engaging with MIRI\u2019s research. It\u2019s a good indicator if you can develop an understanding of a specific problem in the guide and even more so if you can start contributing new ideas or angles of attack on that problem.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Fundraiser</span></p>\n<p><span>It\u2019s turned out very hard to find a fundraiser who is both very good at talking to donors and deeply understands the problems MIRI works on. If someone comes along they would potentially be open to hiring such a person.</span></p>\n<h4 id=\"How_can_you_get_involved_on_a_lower_commitment_basis__\"><span>How can you get involved on a lower commitment basis? </span></h4>\n<p><span>Although there are presently no official volunteer or intern positions, hires always go through a phase of lower commitment involvement through one of the following.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>MIRIx workshops</span></p>\n<p><span>These are independently run workshops about MIRI\u2019s research around the world. Check </span><a href=\"https://intelligence.org/mirix/\"><span>here</span></a><span> if there\u2019s one in your area. If not, you can run one yourself. Organizing a MIRIx workshop is as easy as organizing an EA or Lesswrong meetup. It\u2019s fine to just meet at home and study MIRI\u2019s problems in a group.</span></p>\n<p><span>You organize the logistics and get in contact with MIRI beforehand via </span><a href=\"https://machineintelligence.typeform.com/to/fot777\"><span>this form</span></a><span>. If you organize the workshop, MIRI will pay for the expenses that the participants make as a result of attending (e.g. snacks and drinks).</span></p>\n<p><span>MIRIx workshops can take the form of a study group or a research group centered around MIRI (or related) problems. All you need to take care of is advertising it - it\u2019s good when you already have someone in your city who would be interested. The group will be listed on the </span><a href=\"https://intelligence.org/mirix/\"><span>MIRIx</span></a><span> page and you could advertise it to a relevant university department, on Lesswrong or to your local EA chapter.</span></p>\n<p><span>MIRIx workshops not only let you learn about MIRI\u2019s problems but also potentially provide an opportunity to contribute to MIRI\u2019s research (this varies between groups). If you\u2019re doing well at a MIRIx workshop, it will be noticed.</span></p>\n<p><span>MIRI workshops</span></p>\n<p><span>These workshops in the Bay Area are an absolutely essential part of the MIRI application process, but even if you don\u2019t plan to work at MIRI, your application is encouraged. MIRI pays for all expenses, including international flights.

Researching an adjacent area in math? Get in contact </span><a href=\"https://machineintelligence.typeform.com/to/fot777\"><span>here</span></a><span> to apply for research assistance. If you have a research idea that\u2019s not obviously within MIRI\u2019s research focus but could be interesting, or you have an interest in type theory, do get in contact as well.</span></p>\n<p><span>Research forum</span></p>\n<p><span>Contribute to the research forum at </span><a href=\"http://www.agentfoundations.org\"><span>agentfoundations.org</span></a><span> by sharing a link to a post you made on Lesswrong, GitHub or your personal blog etc. If it gets at least two upvotes, your post will appear on the agentfoundations.org website.

Do have a backup plan. Malo wants to encourage more people to have a go with the math problems, though. Learning more math can contribute to your backup plan as well and you may be able to employ the knowledge to research AI safety problems in other contexts. </span><span>(From another source I heard that if you\u2019re among the best of your year in a quantitative subject at a top university, that\u2019s a good indicator that you should give it a shot.)</span></p>\n<h4 id=\"What_s_the_application_process_like_\"><span>What's the application process like?</span></h4>\n<p><span>The application process is very different from most organizations. It is less formalized and includes a period of progressive engagement. Usually you start off by working on MIRI-style problems via e.g. one of the channels named above and notice that you develop an interest in (one of) them. By then you may have been in contact with someone at MIRI in some way.</span></p>\n<p><span>Attending a MIRI workshop is usually an essential step. This will be a good opportunity for MIRI researchers to get to know you, and for you to get to know them. If it goes well, you could work remotely or on-site as a research contractor spending some share of your time on MIRI-research. Once again, if both sides are interested, this could potentially lead to a full-time engagement.</span></p>\n<h4 id=\"At_what_yearly_donation_would_you_prefer_marginal_hires_to_earn_to_give_for_you_instead_of_directly_working_for_you_\"><span>At what yearly donation would you prefer marginal hires to earn to give for you instead of directly working for you?</span></h4>\n<p><span>The people who get hired as researchers are hard to replace. Hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars would be appropriate depending on the person.

There is no finer example than GiveWell\u2019s meticulously researched and carefully detailed reports laying out the impact per dollar on giving to various charities. As a movement, we are at the cutting edge of what we can currently evaluate about the effectiveness of how we optimize QALYs, although of course much work remains to be done. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>However, as seen in Tom Davidson\u2019s recent piece, \"</span><a href=\"/ea/op/eas_image_problem/\"><span>EA's Image Problem</span></a><span>,\" and my <strong>\u201c</strong></span><a href=\"/ea/or/making_effective_altruism_more_emotionally/\"><span>Making Effective Altruism More Emotionally Appealing</span></a><strong><span>,\u201d</span></strong><span> we currently do not do a very good job of appealing to the heart. We tend to forget Peter Singer\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism/transcript?language=en\"><span>famous quote</span></a><span> that Effective Altruism \u201ccombines both the heart and the head.\u201d When we try to </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vsQdWIcL1nWdTTdQtB4uH1f_rIjDo27-CwaZUnfqEG4/edit#heading=h.uwqwbvy38uwc\"><span>pitch</span></a><span> the EA movement to non-EAs, we focus on the head, not the heart. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Now, I can really empathize with this perspective. I am much more analytically oriented than the baseline, and I find this to be the case for EAs in general. Yet if we want to expand the EA movement, we can't fall into </span><a href=\"http://intentionalinsights.org/succeeding-at-other-minds\"><span>typical mind fallacy</span></a><span> and assume that what worked to convince us will convince others who are less analytical and more emotionally oriented thinkers. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Otherwise, we leave <strong>huge sums of money on the table</strong> that otherwise could have gone to effective charities. For this reason, I and several others have started a nonprofit organization, </span><a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/Intentional-Insights-Spreading-Effective-Altruism-Effectively-to-Broad-Audiences-UTiM2viNkrp\"><span>Intentional Insights</span></a><span>, dedicated to spreading rational thinking and effective altruism to a wide audience using effective marketing techniques. Exploring the field of EA organizations, I saw that The Life You Can Save already has some efforts to reach out to a broad audience, through its </span><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Impact-Calculator\"><span>Charity Impact Calculator</span></a><span> and its </span><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Giving-Games\"><span>Giving Games</span></a><span>, and </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l8rgMz9UBwkxzjLouhNrChniubw4_Aav_CAa_jCwiRE/edit?usp=sharing\"><span>actively promoted</span></a><span> its efforts. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>I was excited when Jon Behar, the COO &amp; Director of Philanthropy Education at TLYCS, reached out to me and suggested collaborating on promoting EA to a broad audience using contemporary marketing methods that appeal to the heart. In a way, this is not surprising, as Peter Singer\u2019s </span><a href=\"http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm\"><span>drowning child problem</span></a><span> is essentially an effort to appeal to people\u2019s hearts in a classroom setting. Using marketing methods that aim to reach a broad audience is a natural evolution of this insight.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Jon and I problem-solved how to spread Effective Altruism effectively, and came up with the idea of a catchphrase that we thought would appeal to people\u2019s emotions well: \u201cBe a Superdonor!\u201d This catchphrase conveys in a short burst crucial information about Effective Altruism, namely that one can have the most powerful impact of one\u2019s donations through giving to the charities that optimize QALYs for the most. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>More importantly, it appeals to the heart well. Superdonor conveys the feeling of power \u2013 you can be super in your donations! Superdonor conveys an especially strong degree of generosity. Superdonor conveys a feeling of superiority, as in better than other donors. In other words, even if you donate less, if you donate more effectively, you can still be better than other donors by donating more effectively. This appeals to the \u201cKeeping Up With the Joneses\u201d effect, a powerful force in </span><a href=\"http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/details_papers.cfm?id=10493\"><span>guiding our spending</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Just as importantly, \u201cBe a Superdonor!\u201d is easily shareable on social media, a vital component of modern marketing in the form of </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof\"><span>social proof</span></a><span>. People get to show their pride and increase their social status by posting on their Facebook or Twitter how they are a Superdonor. This makes their friends curious about what it means to be a Superdonor, since that is an appealing and emotionally resonant phrase. Their friends check out their links, and get to find out about Effective Altruism. Of course, it is important that the link go to a very clear and emotionally exciting description of how one can be a Superdonor through donating. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Likewise, people should get credit for being a Superdonor through getting others to donate through sharing about it on social media, through talking about it to friends, through getting their friends to go to their local EA groups. Thus, we get the power of </span><a href=\"http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/faculty/friedkin/Syllabi/Soc147/Week3Reading.pdf\"><span>social affiliation</span></a><span>, a crucial aspect of motivation, working on behalf of Effective Altruism. A particularly effective strategy for social affiliation here might be to combine \u201cBe A Superdonor\u201d with Giving Games, both the in-person version that TLYCS runs now and perhaps a web app version that helps create a virtual community setting conducive to social affiliation. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Now, some EAs might be concerned that the EA movement would lose its focus on the head through these efforts. I think that is a valid concern, and we need to be aware of the dangers here. We still need to put energy into the excellent efforts of GiveWell and other effective charity evaluators. We still need to be concerned with existential risk, even if it does not present us in the best light to external audiences. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Therefore, as part of the Superdonor efforts, we should develop compassionate strategies to educate emotionally-oriented newcomers about more esoteric aspects of Effective Altruism. For example, EA groups can have people who are specifically assigned as mentors for new members, who can help guide for their intellectual and emotional development alike. At the same time, we need to accept that some of those emotionally-oriented thinkers will not be interested in doing so. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>This is quite fine, as long as we remember our goal of making the strongest impact on the world by optimizing QALYs through not leaving huge sums of money on the table. Consider the kind of benefit you can bring to the EA movement if you can channel the giving of emotionally-oriented thinkers toward effective charities. Moreover, think of the positive </span><a href=\"http://oz.stern.nyu.edu/io/network.html\"><span>network effect</span></a><span> of them getting their friends to donate to effective charities. Think of whether you can make a much bigger difference in doing the most good per energy of effort by focusing more of your own volunteering and giving on EA outreach in comparison to other EA-related activities. This is what inspired my own activities at Intentional Insights, and the recent shifts of the TLYCS toward effective outreach. </span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>What are your thoughts about reaching out to more emotionally-oriented thinkers using </span><a href=\"/ea/ov/improving_the_effectiveness_of_effective_altruism/\"><span>these and other</span></a><span> modern marketing strategies?

Our overall strategy for finding regulations to comment on has been refined with changes to how we search for feedback, but for the most part we are continuing our initial strategy with more skill and less distractions.</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Our current policy comment process typically proceeds as follows: </span><span><br><br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Find proposed rules on </span><a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov/#!home\"><span>Regulations.gov</span></a><span> </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Select rules to comment on after considering difficulty, replaceability, feedback, and potential impact</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Conduct research on:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>How the regulation currently works, compared to the proposed rule</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>What the powers the agency has over the rule and how much control they have over the issue area</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>What useful information or support the regulatory agency needs</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Which experts can assist us</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Which papers can we learn from and cite</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>What are the best changes to make, and their expected benefits</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Draft a comment, while seeking assistance, verification, and feedback</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Revise the comment based on feedback</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Submit the final comment</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Send feedback surveys and request further feedback</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Biggest changes we have made:</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Increased specialization and division of labor among team members</span><span> - Having project members focus their attention on one regulation at a time, and using interns to gather feedback and handle distracting tasks has saved us a lot of time, and allowed us to increase comment length and quality. By going more in-depth, we can address more issues and create more topics for agencies to consider.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Changing our feedback system, spending less time contacting more people</span><span> - When we started the project, it became apparent that waiting for government feedback takes a long time (sometimes over a year), and final rules that guarantee fast feedback only make guarantees because they have already been thoroughly researched and considered. We attempted to use expert feedback as a mechanism for improvement, however our initial attempts involved many emails back and forth with little useful information acquired, despite iterating and changing our methods. After assigning an intern to work exclusively on this problem for roughly a week, we distributed a wide net of emails to many contacts and started getting lots of useful feedback. We are still facing difficulty convincing respondents to fill out the quantitative surveys, as they opt to write their own qualitative opinions of our comments.</span><span><br><br></span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Focusing more on producing comments than other efforts</span><span> - Throughout the project, we encountered a lot of tasks that we tried to tackle, like registering as lobbyists, increasing our transparency, and obtaining feedback. Many of these ideas were not immediately actionable, and some were fairly time-consuming. Also, many of these ideas were less important than simply measuring the effectiveness of comments. This project is an experiment, the larger our sample size is, the more useful information we gain about making policy comments. Given how generalized the project already is, it is likely more valuable to focus on the goal of our experiment: to determine if policy comments are a cost effective way for effective altruists to create policy change.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Focusing more on increasing the number of points we make in comments</span><span> - Regulatory agencies address points separately, which allows comments with more points to receive more feedback. As research time is a costly, diving deeper into a given policy which we have become familiar with often has higher returns than searching for entirely new things to comment on. </span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Progress:</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>We have been producing about 1 policy comment per week, which is half as much as what we initially estimated. Our initial estimates were based on earlier comments submitted in the fall, and in retrospect it is easy to identify reasons why those comments were produced faster:</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>We had full time access to experts</span><span> - Having Richard Bruns and Matt Dahlhausen free to work in 8 hour blocks on weekends allowed us to solve various knowledge problems very quickly. Matt had specialized knowledge on relevant aspects of both of the proposed rules, and Richard is very good at finding new ways to produce economic effect estimates when the relevant data is not available.</span><span><br><br></span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>There was unaccounted for research time</span><span> - Matt Dahlhausen had done some of his own research before we worked on comments in the fall. One of our current most time consuming activities is researching regulations to comment on, and figuring out if a comment is justified. There have been many times where we did hours of research and work on producing a comment only to find out a desired change was going to happen anyway, that a change cannot be made for legal reasons, or that an apparent mistake is only represented on Regulations.gov and not the official proposed rule.</span><span><br><br></span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>There was unaccounted passive work</span><span> - Hours worked were stretched out over multiple weekends, rather than all at once. This allowed us to sleep on ideas longer, and bring them up in discussions at DC Effective Altruism meetups. Having this much passive time allowed us to work very quickly once we had a formal meeting.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul></div></div>"},

It's been observed that there\u2019s often a long lag time before new people even communicate with other members of the community - in my case 10 months. Having well-connected EA friends locally seems to help new people get connected quickly. The newcomers I've talked to were all excited to have easier opportunities of connecting to EAs personally. (Peter Hurford has</span> <a href=\"/ea/gt/we_might_be_getting_a_lot_of_new_eas_what_are_we/\"><span>previously written</span></a> <span>about getting new EAs connected).</span></p>\n<p><span>For getting information</span></p>\n<p><span>Another area where lack of communication decreases our efficiency is sharing information. To give an example: A friend of mine was interested in patent law. She had to do her own research and likely missed some information. Another friend of mine works in patent law and would be happy to talk. They don't live in the same country, but have EA friends in common who could set them up. But they would never end up talking to each other because our information economy is inefficient. Another factor is that the less connected people are often shy about reaching out to the busy, high-performing EAs they don\u2019t personally know.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"The_opportunity\">The opportunity</strong></p>\n<p><span>If you don\u2019t live in a hub, you only very rarely get to personally talk to EAs who are knowledgeable about a specific topic you\u2019re interested in. However, having conversations via Skype and Hangouts can be very insightful and motivating: They have changed e.g. my next career move, my major and motivated me to join volunteer projects which I didn\u2019t even know existed. These are extremely high gains for little time investment. Other EAs report that personal communication is more effective than written exchanged at getting them to actually implement ideas or act on advice.</span></p>\n<p><span>Seeing how widely distributed we are geographically, Skype and Hangouts seem plausibly like a channel where we could increase communication a lot.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Ideas_\">Ideas?</strong></p>\n<p><span>So in this thread I invite you to share your ideas on how to increase communication between EAs. Since we\u2019re great at coming up with ideas and not implementing them, I also invite you to: 1) Just look into and implement your own idea and see what happens 2) Comment on other people\u2019s idea and say that you would like to work on it (or look into it) with them. Then get in personal contact. As mentioned above, the last part is crucial for actually getting things done.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you don\u2019t have the time to implement anything, don\u2019t feel discouraged from posting your thoughts, there\u2019s no obligation. If you\u2019re one of the people who haven\u2019t been in contact with EAs much, implementing such an idea is a great way to get exposure. </span></p>\n<p><span>Let me know if any work gets done as a result of this post.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Existing_systems\">Existing systems</strong></p>\n<p><span>We have some systems in place.

This seemed to be spurred largely by a pledging event held by students linked with the chapter in Cambridge, and perhaps also by a rise in charitable activity associated with the giving season.</p>\n<p>Around this time we realised it would be more efficient to move away from organising outreach events ourselves, towards supporting chapters to run these around the world. Jon Courtney, previously Director of Community, switched to Director of Outreach to focus more of his attention of chapters in March.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As part of this new focus, in the first half of 2015 we supported the development of 15 new chapters, bring the total to around 40. We have also noted from Skype conversations with nearly 200 (15%) of our members that being able to connect with the community is important to many of us. Chapters therefore appear increasingly valuable not only as channels for reaching more people, but for supporting current members and sustaining the Giving What We Can community.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Pledge Wording</span></p>\n<p>In November 2014 we changed the wording of our <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/\">Pledge</a>. Before this, the pledge specified that donations should be made to the most effective charities helping those in the developing world. We opened up the wording to make it more in line with the spirit which underlies Giving What We Can - that we should simply be helping others as much as we can. The change in wording allowed people who believe they can most effectively help others in ways other than fighting extreme poverty (or believe that that will be the case in future) to join.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We chose to do this after several months consulting members and individuals within the effective altruism community. The community feeling within Giving What We Can seems to be unchanged. The benefits of the change are somewhat difficult to gauge so far. They will likely depend on the extent to which the effective altruism movement takes off and whether those affiliated with it do in fact end up joining and donating 10% to the most effective charities.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>New Staff</span></p>\n<p>In early 2015 we hired three new <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/team/#staff\">full-time staff</a>; Alison Woodman joined as Director of Community and Hauke Hillebrandt became Director of Research in March. In April Sam Deere was appointed Director of Communications.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alison\u2019s role will allow us to learn more about our current membership and therefore support our community, as well as track the impact we are having. Hauke is helping to develop a long-term research strategy and has written in-depth reports on each of our currently recommended charities. Sam is has been represented us in media appearances, talks and news articles, whilst also working on creating a new version of <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">our website</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Important Lessons Learned</span></p>\n<p>* \u00a0 The full potential of chapters, particularly when they work on something they are really excited about \u2013 we estimate that the Cambridge pledge event led to 83 new members.</p>\n<p>* \u00a0 In research, our comparative advantage continues to be identifying crucial considerations, particularly those emerging from the academic literature \u2013 such as the link between soil-transmitted helminth infections and malaria. Continuing to keep up with these kinds of developments will therefore be a significant focus for us.</p>\n<p>* \u00a0 The usefulness of automating processes such as bookkeeping and some parts of outreach, and therefore the importance of having someone on staff with significant tech skills.</p>\n<p>* \u00a0 We have continued to be very fortunate in the volunteers we attract, which has been useful for research and for blog writing \u2013 not just our own, but also now for the Huffington Post. That is likely in part because of our excellent blog manager and in part because of being based in Oxford. Given the value this has brought, we should continue to try to be appealing for volunteers to work with.</p>\n<p>* \u00a0 We fundraised for our 2015 budget over a 2 month period in April - May. That was the wrong time of year from a tax perspective, and the long time frame meant we were uncertain about our financial position for a long time. We will therefore be fundraising for our 2016 budget over the first two weeks of December 2015.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><strong>Plans for July 2015 - June 2016</strong></span></p>\n<p>We recently released our 12 month plan for July 2015 to June 2016 which you can read in full <a href=\"https://assets.contentful.com/yglmadi73s3x/2VLf4zx5IQI8M4ogwQuiAQ/36dac82103cb86d1775cc1d8b47fbc1c/Copy_of_Draft_Plan_2015-2016_-_Google_Docs.pdf\">here</a>. Here\u2019s a short summary of our goals and plans. Our primary metric for impact is number of members. We aim to have 2000 members by the end of June 2016.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Membership Pathway</span></p>\n<p>Over this year a large part of our focus is going to be on improving our understanding of the journeys people take towards becoming members, and how we can improve them. We have developed a <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/pathway-to-membership\">Pathway Model</a> which makes explicit our underlying assumptions about how people move from being unaware of Giving What We Can to taking the Giving What We Can pledge, and offers suggestions of factors that influence whether they will advance through any of the intermediate steps.</p>\n<p>Below are the main steps we have mapped out which influence the paths people to go through on the way to becoming members:</p>\n<p>A) Making people aware of Giving What We Can and effective giving</p>\n<p>B) Generating interest in hearing more\u00a0</p>\n<p>C) Inspiring people to want to get involved</p>\n<p>D) Encouraging people to become a part of Giving What We Can</p>\n<p>E) Supporting people to remain long-term active members</p>\n<p>It is likely that it will be higher value to put in work at some points of the pathway than others. One reason for this is the relative crowdedness of the different parts.</p>\n<p>At the moment we are not planning to spend as much time on increasing awareness about effective giving and Giving What We Can as we are on later parts of the pathway. There are currently a number of people focusing on media attention for effective altruism and the relevant organisations, through books, mass media and conferences.</p>\n<p>Two of the biggest ways in which we think we can contribute here are encouraging in-person meet-up groups and supporting people at later stages of the pathway. Supporting people at later stages of involvement seems more likely to be our comparative advantage, as it often requires long-term follow-up and time-consuming outreach to individual people, which volunteers are less likely to be in a good position to do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Recruitment</span></p>\n<p>We are currently in the process of carrying out a recruitment round, looking for both a research analyst and at least one person in an outreach role. The number of applicants we take will likely depend both on the quality of applications we receive, and how our fundraising goes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Fundraising</span></p>\n<p>We will be opening another round of fundraising at the beginning of December in order to raise our budget for 2016. In the next month we will be updating our impact evaluation estimates with recently-gathered data about donations made during 2014.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3 id=\"Get_Involved\"><span>Get Involved</span></h3>\n<p>As always we\u2019d love for more people to get involved in whatever ways they can. Here are just a few ideas:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>* \u00a0 Join a local group, or get in touch with <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.courtney@givingwhatwecan.org\">Jon</a> about setting one up if there isn\u2019t one nearby</p>\n<p>* \u00a0 Write for our blog. We\u2019re always looking for people who are enthusiastic about writing for our blog. Whether or not you have a clear idea of what you\u2019d like to write about, get in touch with <a href=\"mailto:carolina.flores@givingwhatwecan.org\">Carolina</a>, our blog manager, if you\u2019d be interested.</p>\n<p>* \u00a0 Give us feedback. If you have comments about our website, community support, research, local groups or any other aspect of our work, we\u2019d always welcome them. You can send feedback to information@givingwhatwecan.org</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<hr>\n<p>1. $655,000 came through the main donation page advertised on our website, $258,000 via a separate link posted GiveWell\u2019s website, and $155,000 from other sources such as payroll giving platforms.</p>\n<p>2. We estimate around 18% of these donors have taken the pledge or are doing try giving, and the remaining 80% are additional donors.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cross-posted from <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/post/2015/11/highlights-from-2015/\">Giving What We Can</a></p></div></div>"},

Their aim is to raise more than they spend and would have been able to move in other ways. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Currently the team consists of seven full-timers in Vancouver, but three are leaving the organization to </span><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/10/15/charities-wed-like-to-see/\"><span>start</span></a><span> a </span><a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/pi/why_charity_entrepreneurship/\"><span>new</span></a><span> global poverty charity. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>A breakdown of the current projects and other info about Charity Science can be found </span><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/organizational-breakdown.html\"><span>here</span></a><span>. The work can broadly be divided into the very successful proven projects (peer-to-peer fundraisers such as donating one\u2019s birthday and </span><a href=\"/ea/ox/boost_your_impact_by_matching_for_the_christmas/\"><span>Christmas</span></a><span>) and experimental projects such as </span><a href=\"/ea/o2/well_write_you_a_will_for_free_if_you_leave_a/\"><span>legacy fundraising</span></a><span> and the new </span><a href=\"/ea/pe/what_makes_the_new_atheists_so_charitable/\"><span>Skeptics for Charity</span></a><span> project. Some new experimental projects will be chosen in 2016.</span></p>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3 id=\"Current_talent_needs_\"><span>Current talent needs </span></h3>\n<p><strong id=\"Communications_and_Management_Position_\"><span><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/cs-job.html\">Communications and Management Position</a><span> </span></span></strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>This position is currently open and will stay so over the course of 2016 until a suitable applicant is found. The standards are high as you would effectively replace Joey himself or one of the senior management staff. The job description can be found </span><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/cs-job.html\"><span>here</span></a><span>. If you have at least 60% of the following, it\u2019s worth applying since you might be the strongest applicant.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>In this role you'd be managing one to five people, fundraising from non-EAs and communicating efficiently with organizations such as GiveWell and their top charities.</span></p>\n<p><span>A significant difference from some jobs in the EA community is that you can demonstrate your fit by doing volunteer tasks first, even if you can\u2019t yet show that you fit the criteria below. The interview process will also be a quite important way of showing that you possess the necessary qualities, so don\u2019t be discouraged by this long list of requirements:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Very good verbal and written communication skills; e.g. does well at promoting EA charities at a networking event or could write an article in the Huffington Post.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Management experience would be very useful - you would manage a team of 1-5 people.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Very deep understanding of EA; able to debate between different causes and charities with non-EAs. Highly familiar with Charity Science\u2019s and GiveWell\u2019s poverty-focused research.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Highly dedicated to EA and very altruistic since you\u2019ll be joining a team of very committed EAs.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Being familiar with animal rights and being veg*an would be a plus.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Able to break a project down into smaller tasks, delegate and work autonomously</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Being able to move to Vancouver is a plus, but remote work is possible.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Very rigorous, highly evidence-based </span><span>GiveWell classic-style epistemology</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>If you\u2019re a great fit but lacking management experience, you can probably be trained up.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>One of the best ways te demonstrate your fit for this position is by volunteering or interning for Charity Science first. In general, the closer your experience comes to what you\u2019ll be doing on the job (content-wise and process-wise), the better. Other ways to get noticed include:</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Shown ability to learn relevant things quickly, especially interpersonal skills such as public speaking.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Having successfully worked in a team is good, having led one is better and if the project was related to EA or fundraising that\u2019s even better. Having interned (or worked) at an organisation with a similar philosophy, such as GiveWell, would be perfect.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>A history of donating a large share of your income</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Interested in animal rights or veg*anism would indicate a better fit with the team</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Well-known in the EA movement or could get endorsements from other trustable EAs</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Closely following Charity Science and GiveWell\u2019s global-poverty research</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/sec-job.html\">Operations and Finance Officer</a></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Tasks for this position include administrative work such as working with Quickbooks (accounting software), running taxes, and editing documents. It\u2019s likely possible to find a non-EA for this position, so I\u2019ll only include the </span><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/sec-job.html\"><span>link to the job description</span></a><span>. For an EA, this could be a good way to get involved with EA organizations without the need for particular qualifications.</span></p>\n<h4><br></h4>\n<h4 id=\"How_can_you_get_involved_on_a_lower_commitment_basis_\"><span>How can you get involved on a lower commitment basis?</span></h4>\n<p><span>Internship &amp; Volunteering</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/volunteering.html\"><span>Volunteering</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/Charity-Science-Internship.html\"><span>intern</span></a><span> positions at Charity Science are much more open and follow a progressive model. You\u2019ll first get easier tasks and then increasingly difficult ones until you reach a level that fully matches your current skill level. However, your interest and reliability are most important. Some tasks that have been done by volunteers in the past are:</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Running a birthday fundraiser (easy)</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Researching a fundraising intervention such as celebrity fundraising or a poverty-reducing intervention (more advanced)</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Consulting a charity that has asked for advice (more advanced)</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Participate in Charity Science\u2019s strategic decisions and getting on the board (most advanced level)</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><span><span><br></span></span></div>\n<p><span>More potential tasks can be found </span><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/volunteering.html\"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>To start volunteering, simply email tee@charityscience.com. As noted above, this is one of the best ways to get noticed even if you don\u2019t fit the exact job profile. One of the strongest hires started as a volunteer. An intern is simply a volunteer who works at least 5 hours per week over a few months. Currently internships are unpaid.</span></p>\n<h4><br></h4>\n<h4 id=\"What_s_the_application_process_like_\"><span>What's the application process like?</span></h4>\n<p><span>Firstly, you get in contact via the Charity Science website or email </span><a href=\"mailto:joey@charityscience.com\"><span>joey@charityscience.com</span></a><span>. It\u2019s possible to ask questions before you send in the CV and motivation.</span></p>\n<p><span>The application process has been described by some as the most fun one they\u2019ve been through. There\u2019ll be a written question which you answer and send in along with your CV. The question has the most weight. This will be followed by 1 or 2 interviews with more interesting thought experiments, personality and epistemology questions and little tasks. </span></p>\n<p><span>Joey has allowed me to put the written question here so you can apply straight from this post:</span></p>\n<p><span>\u201cYou have a team of yourself and 3 other staff and your goal is to fundraise as much as possible for our evidence-based recommended charities. What strategies would you employ? You can use any resources on our website or from elsewhere for your answer.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span>If you get through the interviews, there\u2019ll be a probationary period of 1-2 months. 100% of EAs got the job afterwards so far.</span></p>\n<p><span>For the administrative role, the process will be focused more on tasks such as quickly figuring out a new software.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>At what yearly donation would you prefer a marginal hire to earn to give for you instead of directly working for you?</span></p>\n<p><span>For the admin position US$ 5,000 with a range of $5,000 to $20,000 and for the communications role $100,000 with a range of 50,000$ to 200,000$. Joey has put some thought into this and as a matter of fact, a previous applicant who could have donated US$ 50,000-70,000 per year opted to work for Charity Science instead.</span></p>\n<h4><br></h4>\n<h4 id=\"Why_work_at_Charity_Science__\"><span>Why work at Charity Science? </span></h4>\n<p><span>The basic selling point is that Charity Science can raise significantly more than $1 for GiveWell-recommended charities for each dollar spent on running Charity Science. Last year they\u2019ve raised $9 for every dollar spent and this ratio could go up in the future. They will only hire you if they think this is the highest expected value thing for you to do, i.e. taking opportunity costs into account.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Charity Science is also, alongside GiveWell, the most rigorous and transparent about their work among the organizations in the EA community.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>While the direct impact is the most important factor they offer a high variety of tasks and a level of autonomy that you wouldn\u2019t get in a corporate job. As a result, the work is high in skill-building and exploration value.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>You\u2019d work in a startup atmosphere with flexible working hours and be located in the thriving EA hub Vancouver. There\u2019s a strong social community with social EA events such as TED talk nights, raves, sport events, etc 3-4 times a week and 10 EAs living within a block. The people are quite intense about EA and the culture could help you intensify your own involvement. Charity Science helps you find accommodation and can put you in a house with other EAs if you wish.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>A more detailed list of the benefits can be found in the job description for the </span><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/cs-job.html\"><span>communications role</span></a><span>.</span></p></div></div>"},

One way to do this is to make causal diagrams. I\u2019ve made two below for illustrative purposes.</span></p>\n<p><span>Below is a list of some possible things we might mean by narrow and broad, or related terms.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>A long path to impact</span><span> vs </span><span>a short path to impact</span><span>.

How do we cleave these causal diagrams at their true joints? One rule of thumb for drawing out such diagrams in practice could be that a \u2018step\u2019 in the chain is something that is less than 99% likely to happen - anything higher than that can be ignored, though this too is vulnerable to arbitrariness in what you lump together as a single step.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>I believe in the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/htn/nick_beckstead_on_the_overwhelming_importance_of/\">overwhelming importance of shaping the long term future</a>. In my view most causal chains that could actually matter are likely to be very long by normal standards.

You can, and should!, also share it with friends who could become EAs but aren't already.</p>\n<p>I'll provide more of the details below. But first, I'll try to anticipate the EA community response and address it.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Q1__Why_are_we_doing_this__\">Q1. Why are we doing this? </strong></p>\n<p>A1: First and foremost, we're running this contest because our book marketing agency has recommended we do so. This agency is behind the successes of many New York Times bestsellers, and they have done this type of contest successfully before.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Q2__But_isn_t_this_just_clickbait__\">Q2. But isn't this just clickbait? </strong></p>\n<p>A2: Not really. This contest incentivizes effective altruists to share it with their friends, introducing them to the movement. Since it is a giveaway that is free to enter, with prizes that will help share effective altruism with the winners, it is hopefully a great, easy way to begin to introduce new people to EA. Plus, you could win (and probably want) one of these EA-related prizes yourself.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Q3__What_is_the_benefit__\">Q3. What is the benefit? </strong></p>\n<p>A3: This should help us attract a number of people who are likely to be interested in effective altruism, but not already involved.

Can we do anything about it?", "author": "TopherHallquist", "num_comments": "21 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Until recently, I thought that the risk of a nuclear war in the 21st century, while not zero, was nevertheless very low and the marginal bit of effort spent reducing it further was probably not a good use of resources. But in the past two weeks, a series of articles on Vox.com have led me to rethink that view. <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8845913/russia-war\">The most detailed of them</a> is worth reading for full context, but I think the key points are these:</p>\n<p></p><ol>\n<li>Some experts are starting to worry that recent events in eastern Europe have raised the risk of a NATO-Russia nuclear war.</li>\n<li>This is because Putin is feeling vulnerable and threatened, and is using nuclear saber-rattling to compensate, doing some things even Cold War-era Soviet leaders avoided (because they felt more secure in their position).</li>\n<li>While nobody wants an all-out nuclear war, a particularly worrisome scenario is that Putin does something which, he expects, will scare NATO into backing off, but instead leads to a spiral of escalation.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>Another article reports on <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/7/6/8900237/russia-war-odds\">a survey of experts putting the risk of nuclear war with Russia over the next 5 years at 2%</a>. There's also a <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8858909/russia-war-flowchart\">flowchart of how a crisis could escalate</a>.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>I've tried to see if other people in the EA community have thought about this issue. The main thing I can find is <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3A80000hours.org+nuclear+war&amp;oq=site%3A80000hours.org+nuclear+war&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.5207j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=site:givewell.org+nuclear+war&amp;search_plus_one=form\">GiveWell's research into nuclear policy</a>, but when they've looked into the risk of nuclear war, the focus has been on an India-Pakistan nuclear war (which admittedly could be pretty devastating, not just to India and Pakistan but to the rest of the world via fallout and environmental damage).</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>I'm not sure what to do about this, except to say that it might be nice if GiveWell looked into the issue, if only on the level of one of their \"conversation with a single expert\" reports. A longer-term strategy might to found an organization dedicated to shifting incentives towards politicians in the US, UK, and France towards less bellicose rhetoric and less escalation, and more international compromise. (One worry when looking at the risk of nuclear war is that politicians may be repeatedly tempted to do things that slightly raise international tensions, for the sake of scoring political points back home.) But it would take a special skill set to be able to found such an organization.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Does anyone else have any other ideas?</div>\n<p></p></div></div>"},

{"date": "30th Jul 2015", "title": "What I learnt from talking to over 100 Giving What We Can members ", "author": "aliwoodman", "num_comments": "3 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span>Hi,</span></p>\n<p><span>I work at Giving What We Can as Director of Community. As part of this, I've been trying to get to know\u00a0as many of our members (people who have taken the Giving What We Can pledge) as possible, mostly through talking with recently signed up members. I wrote this blog post a little while back talking about a couple of my findings, but it only recently occurred to me that people on here may not have seen it but might be interested. </span></p>\n<p><span>Below is an adapted version (see original post </span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-07-20/what-i-learnt-talking-over-100-giving-what-we-can-members\"><span>here</span></a><span>). Especially relevant might be the reasons why people take the pledge instead of just giving a chosen % by themselves. For instance, I've found a fair number of people who were already giving, or planning to give, a significant amount, who only recently realised there were still benefits to joining. I imagine there are more out there, and Giving What We Can would love to have you on board!</span></p>\n<p><span>Why do people pledge?</span></p>\n<p><span>We\u2019re naturally interested in why people choose to donate a significant amount of their income to others, and our blog has highlighted individual stories in the </span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-07-01/giving-receiving\"><span>series</span></a><span> \u2018</span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-06-22/becoming-effective-altruist\"><span>Why</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-04-30/how-religion-motivates-my-giving\"><span>I</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-02-10/why-i-finally-took-pledge\"><span>give</span></a><span>\u2019. One of the most interesting things I\u2019ve been learning about is this: why do members choose to take a pledge, rather than make a private commitment to give 10%? I found that, in nearly all cases, people spontaneously gave one or more of the three following answers:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>\u201cTaking the pledge acts as a commitment device\u201d</span><span>: this was the most common explanation I heard. Choosing to give 10% of your lifetime income is a long term commitment, and many people find that it\u2019s easy to forget internal goals as time goes on. By joining Giving What We Can, you make a public commitment, and have more accountability, so you\u2019re more likely to stay on track.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>\u201cBy joining I might inspire others to join\u201d</span><span>: this was the second most common reason given. By joining you can signal your support - you add your name to our </span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/members\"><span>list of members</span></a><span> and it makes it easier to explain your giving to others when you are part of an established group who are all doing something similar. Indeed, some of the members I spoke with had already decided to give away 10% or more before they heard of Giving What We Can, but they saw that by joining they could encourage others to do so too.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>\u201cI like the community aspect\u201d</span><span>: for a smaller group of members, joining was a way to become more involved in a community and to meet like-minded people. For most of these, community was closely tied to their feelings about commitment, since giving as part of a community can help motivate you to achieve your aims.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Community and chapters</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dcAi4gr8DJVL6Gk2xWt9r8crMoz_ygk-w03GX8ImP6HgE9Mgv1LeyyYpTUqraacC2sMLtlYFGe84VccxBJl2dUCesPjT6HD7-0wEY60Gzwd9WOcUGBo7SiaIlrwupvzHQfs_VjA\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p><span>Another of my focuses during conversations is on finding out how well connected members were to other people in the community (both Giving What We Can members and people interested in effective giving more broadly), and to gauge their interest in meeting other members. So far, I\u2019ve found that nearly all of the members I\u2019ve spoken with wished to be connected with other members. Most of these either already knew some people within the community or had a local chapter or meetup group they planned to check out. However, there were a number of people who did not know anybody in the community, and did not have a chapter within travelling distance.</span></p>\n<p><span>Combine the demand for chapters among current members with the fact that the most common way people hear about Giving What We Can is through word of mouth (and 27 out of 80 members I asked told me they had interacted with a local chapter before joining) - this suggests local chapters and meet up groups are really valuable. Even small and informal meetup groups provide a place to come together with others who care deeply about improving the lives of others.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>If you think you may be interested in starting a local chapter or meetup group, you can go </span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/chapters\"><span>here</span></a><span> and Jon, our super friendly Director of Outreach, will get in touch (or feel free to email him directly at </span><span>jonathan.courtney[at]givingwhatwecan.org</span><span>).</span></span></p></div></div>"},

{"date": "23rd Mar 2015", "title": "Common Misconceptions about Effective Altruism", "author": "Denis Drescher", "num_comments": "15 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>In reaction to a recent article that straw-manned effective altruism seemingly without intent, I decided to write an <a href=\"http://claviger.net/common-misconceptions-about-effective-altruism.html\">article on some common misconception about effective altuism</a>, and Tom Ash started two corresponding wiki pages, one on \u201c<a href=\"http://effective-altruism.wikia.com/wiki/Common_objections_to_effective_altruism\">Common objections to effective altruism</a>\u201d and one on \u201c<a href=\"http://effective-altruism.wikia.com/wiki/Common_objections_to_earning_to_give\">Common objections to earning to give</a>.\u201d I\u2019ve copied this article into the first. If you have anything to add or correct, you\u2019re invited to contribute it there, so that well-meaning journalists can more easily avoid such\u00a0errors.</p>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<hr>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<p>Effective altruism has seen much welcome criticism that has helped it refine its strategies for determining how to reach its goal of doing the most good\u2014but it has also seen some criticism that is fallacious. In the following we want to correct some misconceptions that we\u2019ve become aware of so\u00a0far.</p>\n<h2 id=\"If_Everyone_Did_That___Kantian_fallacy__\">If Everyone Did That (\u201cKantian\u00a0fallacy\u201d)</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Misconception\">Misconception</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\u201cIf we all followed such a ridiculous approach\u201d as effective altruism, then all worthwhile causes outside \u201cglobal health and nutrition\u201d would cease to receive funding.<sup><a href=\"#fn:ssir\">1</a></sup></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"Short_Answers\">Short\u00a0Answers</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Top effective charities have limited room for more funding. At some point they\u2019ll have absorbed so much money that additional donations will do much less good, so other charities will become top\u00a0charities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If only 0.03% of the yearly donations only in the <span>US</span> were shifted to the top effective charities we know of, they would have no room for more\u00a0funding.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once that point is reached, doing the most good will get slightly more expensive or slightly more risky, and all the other previously less effective or less proven interventions would successively get their\u00a0funding.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>But yes, \u201cfunding for the arts\u201d would have to wait until deadly diseases and extreme poverty are sufficiently under\u00a0control.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"Long_Answers\">Long\u00a0Answers</h3>\n<p>In evaluating interventions, charity prioritization typically relies on the criteria of tractability, scalability, and neglectedness. The last two of these turn charity prioritization into an anti-inductive system, where some arguments along the lines of the categorical imperative become inapplicable: You recommend an underfunded intervention, then people follow your recommendation and donate to it, then it reaches its limits in scale, and finally you have to withdraw your recommendation as it is no longer\u00a0underfunded.</p>\n<p>Imagine you are organizing a large two-day effective altruism convention. There are several hotels close to the venue, one of which is very well known and soon fully booked. Panicked attendees keep asking you what they should do, so you call the other hotels in the vicinity. It turns out there is one that is even closer to the venue with scores of rooms left. So you send out a tweet and recommend that people check in there. They do, and promptly the hotel is also fully booked, and you have to do another round of telephone calls and update your recommendation. But it is fallacious to argue that your first recommendation, or the very act of making it, was wrong to begin with just because if everyone follows it, it\u2019s no longer valid. That\u2019s in the nature of the\u00a0beast.</p>\n<p>Because the \u201cif everyone did that\u201d argument so common, let\u2019s give it a name: \u201cKantian fallacy.\u201d The \u201cbuy low, sell high\u201d rule of the stock market is not wrong just because if everyone bought low, the price would not be low, and if everyone sold high, the price would not be high. Advising against the overused typeface Papyrus is not wrong just because if no one used it, it would no longer be overused. Surprising someone with a creative present is not wrong just because if everyone made the same present, it would not be\u00a0surprising.</p>\n<p>The last analogy is less fitting than the previous ones, because we don\u2019t actually want good interventions to be underfunded. When all the governments and foundations see how great deworming is and allocate so much funding to it that hardly a worm survives, then any recommendation for more donations for deworming has to be withdrawn in favor of more neglected interventions\u2014but that\u2019s a reason to\u00a0party!</p>\n<p>So what would recommendations look like when malaria, schistosomiasis, and poverty are eradicated or eliminated to the extent that other interventions become superior? Or what would happen when other bottlenecks thwart further effective donations in these\u00a0areas?</p>\n<p>That future is already sending its sunny rays into the past as foundations like Good Ventures and the Gates Foundation already have much more funding available than the currently known top charities could absorb. What happens is that doing good either becomes more expensive (when you trade off cost-effectiveness for scalability) or more risky (when you trade off certainty for other qualities). The latter is the more interesting and encouraging scenario. More on that in the next\u00a0section.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Exclusive_Focus_on_Interventions_That_are_Easy_to_Study\">Exclusive Focus on Interventions That are Easy to\u00a0Study</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Misconception1\">Misconception</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u201cI mentioned bed nets because that is mostly what Effective Altruism amounts to: It measures what is immediately and visibly measurable, a problem known as the Streetlight Effect.\u201d<sup><a href=\"#fn:week\">2</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\u201cGiveWell has a particular fixation with global health and nutrition charities. It at least implicitly recommends that one should support charities only in those cause areas.\u201d<sup><a href=\"#fn:ssir\">1</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"Short_Answers1\">Short\u00a0Answers</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Empirically, more effective altruists are eager to invest into highly speculative, high risk\u2013high return interventions than prefer the safe investments of proven and repeatable medical\u00a0interventions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This eagerness to accept financial and personal risks to effect superior positive impact has led to a flourishing culture of metacharities, prioritization research, medical research, political research and advocacy, research on global catastrophic risk, and much more within the\u00a0movement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GiveWell in particular has long been been eager to expand to less easy-to-study interventions, so that it has been investigating (under the name Open Philanthropy Project) a wide range of global catastrophic risks, political causes, and opportunities for research funding since before effective altruism had a\u00a0name.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"Long_Answers1\">Long\u00a0Answers</h3>\n<p>Where the last answer required a new name for a fancy fallacy, this one is simply called \u201cstraw\u00a0man.\u201d</p>\n<p>As a pioneer in the field of charity prioritization, GiveWell had a herculean task ahead of it and very limited resources in terms of money, time, and research analysts. (This was years before effective altruism had consolidated into a movement.) Since funneling more donations to above-average charities is already better than the status quo, the team quickly learned that as a starting point they had to focus narrowly on cause areas marked by extreme suffering, interventions with solid track-records of cost-effective and scalable implementation, and charities with the transparency and commitment to self-evaluation that would enable GiveWell to assess them. As it happens, these combinations were mostly found in the cause areas of disease and poverty. This decision was one of necessity at the time, but soon later, GiveWell managed to scale up its operations significantly, so that these restrictions no longer\u00a0applied.</p>\n<p>Some of the best and most cost-effective giving opportunities may well lie in areas or involve interventions that are harder to study. Hence GiveWell has been investigating these under the brand of the Open Philanthropy Project (initially known as \u201cGiveWell Labs\u201d) since 2011. (That\u2019s still before effective altruism had a name or called itself a movement.) Much scientific research promises great cost-effectiveness; so do some interventions to avert global catastrophic risks and to solve political problems. Doing the most good may well mean investing somewhere in one of these areas\u2014where exactly, Open Phil has set out to find\u00a0out.</p>\n<p>In 2012 the effective altruism movement got its name and consequently  consolidated its efforts at doing the most good. Nowhere in the agenda  of the movement it said that effective interventions needed to be easy  to study or quantify. In fact opinions and preferences on what \u201cthe most  good\u201d means in practice vary (yet some are shared by almost everyone).  According to a <a href=\"/ea/gb/the_2014_survey_of_effective_altruists_results/\">2014 survey</a>,  about 71% of the EAs in the survey sample were interested in supporting  poverty-related causes, but almost 76% were interested in metacharity  including rationality and prioritization research, which are not easy to  quantify. About one third to fourth were interested in each of  antispeciesism, environmentalism, global catastrophic risk, political  causes, and (nonexistential) far future concerns, most of which are hard  to study. There is by no means an unwarranted bias toward interventions  that are easy to study; if anything, there\u2019s a surprising tendency  towards speculative, high risk\u2013high return\u00a0interventions.</p>\n<p>Finally, GiveWell not only doesn\u2019t \u201cimplicitly recommends that one should support charities only in [the cause areas of global health and nutrition]\u201d but (1) <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly\">recommends a charity</a> outside these areas, (2) writes on every charity review that did not lead to a recommendations that the \u201cwrite-up should not be taken as a \u2018negative rating\u2019 of the charity\u201d (emphasis in original), and (3) gives reasons for why a philanthropist may legitimately choose not to donate to their recommended charities right on their <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">Top Charities</a>\u00a0page.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Consequentialism_and_Utilitarianism\">Consequentialism and\u00a0Utilitarianism</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Misconception2\">Misconception</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Effective altruism depends on a utilitarian or consequentialist morality as implied in statements like, \u201cnot that [reducing corruption in the police force] could meet [effective altruism\u2019s] utilitarian criteria for review.\u201d<sup><a href=\"#fn:week\">2</a></sup></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"Short_Answers2\">Short\u00a0Answers</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>What\u2019s so bad about wanting to maximize happiness and minimize suffering in the\u00a0world?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>But there are also effective altruists with other moral systems, and effective altruism seems to follow from them as\u00a0well.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"Long_Answers2\">Long\u00a0Answers</h3>\n<p>Admittedly most effective altruists are utilitarians or consequentialists. If you want to maximize happiness and minimize suffering in the world (or maximize informed preference satisfaction), then it\u2019s clear how effective altruism follows\u00a0forcibly.</p>\n<p>But how about deontology?

Surely you\u2019d make an admirable effective\u00a0altruist.</p>\n<p>This is beside the point, but a less corrupt police force will provide greater safety to the population and enjoy greater trust in return. The rich will no longer have recourse to bribing the police, so that poorer people are in a better position to trade and negotiate with them. The positive marginal impact on the happiness of the poor is likely to be greater than the marginal negative impact on the happiness of the rich. So there\u2019s one of countless utilitarian cases for fighting\u00a0corruption.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Top_Down_and_Elitist\">Top-Down and\u00a0Elitist</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Misconception3\">Misconception</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\u201cThe defective altruism distribution plan \u2018requires a level of expertise that few individuals have.\u2019 Thus, over time, we would require a very centralized and top-down approach to marshal and manage social investment and charitable giving decisions in a manner acceptable to the proponents of this approach.\u201d<sup><a href=\"#fn:ssir\">1</a></sup></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"Short_Answers3\">Short\u00a0Answers</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>That this is the case is a central grievance of the charity market, which effective altruism tries to remedy and without which the movement might not even be\u00a0necessary.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"Long_Answers3\">Long\u00a0Answers</h3>\n<p>It is one of the unfortunate truisms of the human condition that no market is perfect, but the charity market is particularly and abysmally imperfect. If someone wants to buy a solid state drive they might check, among other things, the price per gigabyte. $.96 per gigabyte? Rather expensive. $.38 per gigabyte? Wow, what a bargain! When people want to invest into a company, they check out the company\u2019s earning over the past years, compare them to the stock price, and decide whether it\u2019s a bargain or usury. Or if you have a headache, do you buy a homeopathic remedy that does nothing for $20 or Aspirin for\u00a0$5?</p>\n<p>I wasn\u2019t there when it happened, but I imagine when the first effective altruists wanted to donate they called charities and were like \u201cHi, I like what you do and want to invest into your program. Could you give me your latest impact figures?\u201d I imagine the responses ranged from \u201cOur what?\u201d over \u201cYou\u2019re the first to ever ask for that\u201d to \u201cWe have no\u00a0idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>When the charities that run the programs don\u2019t even know if they do anything good or anything at all in proportion to their cost, then how are donors supposed to find out? They would have to draw on the research of experts in the field and, to some extent, would have to become experts\u00a0themselves.</p>\n<p>Prioritization organizations want to change that. They flaunt a pot of money promised to the charities that make the best case for being highly effective. That way they incentivize transparency, self-evaluation, and optimization. Eventually, we hope, this will encourage a charity market that makes it much easier for everyone to recognize the charities with the most \u201cbang for the\u00a0buck.\u201d</p>\n<div>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Ken Berger and Robert M.

{"date": "25th May 2015", "title": "Effective Altruism as an intensional movement", "author": "Diego_Caleiro", "num_comments": "15 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><address>Cross posted at <a href=\"http://diegocaleiro.com/2015/05/26/effective-altruism-as-an-intensional-movement/\">diegocaleiro.com</a></address><address>This text grew out of discussions with some of EA global planners, many previous discussions with individuals considering if they want to identify as EAs and strategic considerations scattered around many EA articles. It is particularly related to Helen Toner's\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/9s/effective_altruism_is_a_question_not_an_ideology/\">Effective Altruism is a question, not an ideology</a>.</address><address><br></address>\n<p>A confusion I hear frequently from new EAs working on movement building takes the following form:\u00a0</p>\n<p>1) Effective Altruism is a movement</p>\n<p>2) Other movements have done this or that (say, accelerate movement growth using this technique X), should Effective Altruism be doing the same?</p>\n<p>3) Other movements failed in thing Z and now most people in them are not sane, how can we avoid this?</p>\n<p>These claims and questions rest on a reference class assumption that is false.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>It is false that the reference class to reason about Effective Altruism is the\u00a0<em>movements</em>\u00a0class</strong>.</p>\n<p>Not all movements are made alike. Although EA has many movement characteristics, such as growth rates, core groups, a need to mobilize people, some epistemic and value alignment, a desire to grow, a sense of identity etc, it also has additional features that makes it different from most - not all - movements that came before. One of them I want to bring to surface and make salient in everyone's minds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Effective_Altruism_is_an_intensional_movement__not_an_extensional_movement_\">Effective Altruism is an intensional movement, not an extensional movement\u00a0</h2>\n<p>This distinction comes from philosophy of language and psycholinguistics, and goes like this: \"two to the power of three\" and \"the number of planets in the solar system\" are intensions, both of which capture the same extension, the number 8.</p>\n<p>An intension is the way in which a symbol, a sign, or a gesture captures an object. An extension is the object that it captures in that way.</p>\n<p>\"The morning star\" and \"the evening star\" are both intensions, it just so happens that, though nobody knew about it when they named them, both ended up being the same thing in the world. Both of them capture the same celestial object, which curiously happens to be the planet Venus! Venus is the extension of \"the evening star\" and \"the morning star\". \u00a0</p>\n<p>So what does it mean to say that Effective Altruism is more like an intension than like an extension? It means that the things which unify the different people, thinkers, researchers and donors that compose the EA movement are ways of reasoning, or methods, or perspectives, but they are not ultimately and fully pre-determined and established states of the world. They are not the object, but the means through which we intend to reach the object and capture it - those who were at the 2014 EA Global (Summit) have seen this exposed for instance in Rob Wiblin's talk when he mentioned different moral philosophies all of which compatible with being an EA, but I want to emphasize this again here, given how many times I've found people asking me something to which this was the explanation again. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The same intension has a very important property when distinguishing movements, it <em>can refer or point to different things at different times. </em>That is, the extension to which the intension is currently pointing can change. \"The number of planets\" used to point to the number 9, it now points to 8. Effective Altruism as a practice will also necessarily change over time, because the largest marginal returns on effort and resource usage to do the best thing are not stable, and even if they were stable, we don't have immediate perfect direct access to them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Effective Altruist currently refers to some groups of people who are aligned on many dimensions, but Effective Altruism is not prescriptive in the way religious movements are, where the object-level behaviors are already established, or the facts are declared known in advance. The thing that unifies for instance the Catholic church is a series of beliefs about extensions, about the behaviors, objects, saints and deities themselves. When a growth planner plans to make the Catholic movement grow, they need to impart that extension into the convertee's mind. When the racial equality movement wants more people to join their cause, the goal is to change people's behaviors and beliefs at the extensional level; they want people to know that and behave as if racial prejudice was unjustified. I use these two examples to clarify that being an extensional movement doesn't mean actually referring to a thing in the world, the Catholic Saints are not actual deities, whereas racial prejudice in fact is unjustified. One false and one true example.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why_does_being_an_intensional_movement_means_a_different_reference_class_for_EA_\">Why does being an intensional movement means a different reference class for EA?</h2>\n<p>1) It means there is a much more nuanced border between who is an EA or not.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2) It means EAs will form a gradient of level of EA-ness, as opposed to a binary clustering. Whereas religious movements will measure how central a member is by how intense a person's commitment to not change their mind, for instance how elated they feel about their true belief, how intense their devotion is, EA will see a person as more EA if they hold more beliefs within a large cluster of methodogical beliefs to be right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3) It means that people can be persuaded to be EAs even without agreeing with the current priority agenda, if they believe that the EA intension, will, over time, shift towards a better extension, which they currently believe is more valuable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>4) It means that it is better to compare the growth of EA and how to go about it with the growth of other intensional movements, such as the advent of peer-review, the general adoption of the scientific method or the propagation of universities. These are movements in a sense of course, but it is a narrower sense with very different properties from movements like feminism or socialism.\u00a0</p>\n<p>5) A different way to see this is that for extensional movements, if my core movement belief is that a sentence P is true, and you believe ~P, then the <em>only</em>\u00a0way for you to join my movement is if you start believing P and abandon ~P. Not so for EAs. If we currently believe (let's call this G) that the far future is important and we should try to colonize the galaxy, and you believe ~G, it is perfectly reasonable to envision a day two years from now where you continue to believe ~G and you are now an EA, and I who used to believe G have been persuaded by your argument that present people matter more than future people. I do not lose my EA identity by changing my core beliefs about what matters or what should be done. This is not the case for racial, religious or political movements. It is impossible to not believe there is a God and be a full-fledged Catholic, no matter how elated you are, or how careful the procedure through which you arrived at the conclusion of God's inexistence. If you persuaded all Catholics of God's nonexistence, you would not have changed Catholicism; you would have ended it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>6) EA is in a narrower reference class than that of movements, and many of the intuitions that work for other movements break for EA. There are however other movements that are also about the way in which you capture what you want, not directly about the state of the world that you want. \u00a0These should be taken as much more valuable when trying to take the outside view on the development of EA in the long run.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Some_intensional_movement_examples_for_ease_of_reference_class_availability\">Some intensional movement examples for ease of reference class availability</h2>\n<p>When we think of movements and movement building some salient ones come to mind: feminism, political equality, racial equality, scientology, religious movements and socialism are the most salient in my mind. None of these are intensional. So here is a historical list of intensional ones to give a sense of what that class looks like. These are ones which don't pre-establish the behaviors and world states beforehand, but are open-ended and figure them out as they go.\u00a0</p>\n<p>1) Peer-review</p>\n<p>2) Universities</p>\n<p>3) Open source software community</p>\n<p>4) Academic philosophy</p>\n<p>5) Lesswrong\u00a0</p>\n<p>6) MIT</p>\n<p>7) US Army\u00a0</p>\n<p>8) Gates Foundation</p>\n<p>When in doubt as a heuristic, try to use the P to ~P shift. MIT and the US army could completely re-design their strategic considerations on how to go about being a great university or protecting American lives and they would still be MIT and the US Army. Now the following examples are cases where it isn't clear immediately, so I suggest you try to think if they are intensional or extensional movements before reading on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>a) Singularitarians</p>\n<p>b) Transhumanists</p>\n<p>c) Longevity alliance</p>\n<p>d) 80,000 Hours.</p>\n<p>These were selected because though they are related to the EA community, they are about specific ways for the world to be. The longevity alliance won't advocate shorter lifespans, and transhumanism will not advocate maintaining the status quo of the human condition, and avoiding being better than well. 80,000 Hours is a career adviser. All the members could decide it needs not exist and continue to be EAs, but 80,000 Hours would be dissolved as a consequence. The four examples above are all extensional movements/institutions.</p>\n<p>I hope I hear over the course of the next weeks more discussions using examples and drawing valuable conclusions from the narrow set of intensional movements. The EA movement will still change its extension quite a few times until it maybe reaches a more stable desired world state. But no matter how long and how stable, how convergent it ends up being at the end of the day, it will always be open to further scrutiny and change. The outside view on EA should be the outside view on intensional movements, not on all movements. Those who are planning where to direct its movement-aspects have to take that factor into account. I hope from now on everyone will.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Examples_where_the_distinct_reference_class_of_intensional_movements_makes_a_difference\">Examples where the distinct reference class of intensional movements makes a difference</h2>\n<p>Roxanne and Oliver suggested that I give some examples where the emphasis on \"intensional movement\" makes a difference, and to mention that these are not all the examples, just the intuition pumps to start the engine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>a) When considering strategically how to interact with members of other movements, there is ample room for collaboration and less need for competition, because frequently one can become an EA without recanting their previous affiliation with some extensional movement. So it changes strategic collaboration considerations.\u00a0</p>\n<p>b) Intensional movements are more nuanced in how much buy-in individuals need. The transition processes both inwards and outwards towards core community are smoother, and can happen without deep epiphanies, or large cognitive dissonance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>c) Paul Christiano argues that\u00a0<a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/06/13/against-moral-advocacy/\">moral advocacy</a> may turn out to not be the best way to go about building EA, an intensional movement, even though it seems needed for most extensional movements.\u00a0</p>\n<p>d) Fluid hierarchical positions and merit-based judgement structures are more valuable for intensional than they are for extensional movements. It is better to have one pope until he dies, but several university deans over a decade, preferably not arbitrarily selected. Guru's are frequently attached to the extension of which they are gurus, although it is possible to become a guru-like figure without attaching yourself to any particular extension - e.g. Putnam, Neumann, Feyman.\u00a0</p>\n<p>e) Intensional structures can be more long-lived without need for cognitive dissonance, they are more epistemically robust to changes in weltanschauung(worldview). Yuval Harari's\u00a0<em>Sapiens</em> (2014)\u00a0is a good history book to capture that intuition, it recaptures the whole of history and shows the relative causal unimportance of reactive extensional movements like most religions in the very long run.\u00a0</p>\n<p>f) Related to the previous point, intensional structures are more dynamic, and permit more action to originate from the inside. Borrowing from Dennett, the intuition here is that intensional movements are not a leash, but a trampoline which enlarges the scope of actions that a group can have.</p>\n<p>With these examples I hope the intuition that Effective Altruism is an intensional movement can be steelmanned in your mind into a powerful concept. Sometimes - say, to make hiring decisions - it may well be fine to use movements at large as your reference class, but frequently it is more valuable to think of Effective Altruism as an intensional movement. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to it!<br></em></p>\n<h2 id=\"Overview\">Overview</h2>\n<p>Effective altruism is about doing the <em>most</em> good in the world. This includes figuring out what exactly that means, how it can be achieved, and implementing these\u00a0insights.</p>\n<p>Central to the movement are the following\u00a0ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Top charities are thousands of times more cost-effective than others<sup><a href=\"#fn:dcp2\">1</a></sup><sup><a href=\"#fn:to-imp\">2</a></sup> and make it easy to have a huge positive\u00a0impact.</li>\n<li>Hence, it is typically more important <em>where</em> you give than <em>what</em> you give, and empirical, scientific research needs to guide these giving decisions, not personal bias or geographic\u00a0proximity.</li>\n<li>Failing to give or failing to give effectively incurs tremendous avoidable\u00a0suffering.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The following sections will explain these points in more detail, and the final one will give an overview of the\u00a0movement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Altruism\">Altruism</h2>\n<p>Few people would be content to note on their deathbed that they have wasted their life on egoistic pursuits, so that after their death the world will be as if they had never\u00a0lived.</p>\n<p>Enter consequentialist philosophers. Many people find it intuitive that we\u2014the average readers of this article who live in <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i\">relative affluence</a>\u2014have a moral obligation to help, but for those that still have reservations, Peter Singer, Toby Ord, Thomas Pogge, Peter Unger, Shelly Kagan, and others have analogies similar to the following classic by Peter Singer<sup><a href=\"#fn:pond\">3</a></sup>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imagine that you\u2019re walking across a park past a shallow ornamental pond and you notice that a small child has fallen in, and seems to be in danger of drowning. \u2026 Of course, you think \u201cI must rush in and save the child.\u201d Then you remember that you\u2019re wearing your favorite, quite expensive, pair of shoes and they\u2019ll get ruined if you rush into the\u00a0pond.</p>\n<p>Is that a reason for not saving the child? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll say no it isn\u2019t, you just can\u2019t compare the life of a child to the cost of a pair of shoes, no matter how expensive.\u00a0\u2026</p>\n<p>But think about how that relates to your situation in the world today. There are children whose lives you can save. \u2026 Nearly 10 million children die every year from avoidable, poverty related causes. That\u2019s almost 27,000 every day. And it wouldn\u2019t take a lot to save the lives of these children. We can do\u00a0it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The estimated cost<sup><a href=\"#fn:gw-ce\">4</a></sup> of saving a child\u2019s life is likely greater than even rather expensive shoes, but compared to the the value of a child\u2019s life\u2014an often fulfilling, happy life seventy-odd years\u2014the difference is\u00a0negligible.</p>\n<p>However, effective altruism is not about rushing in and putting all our resources into saving one child\u2019s life. With ten thousands of people dying of preventable or treatable diseases every day,<sup><a href=\"#fn:unicef\">5</a></sup> we need to pay the utmost attention to maximize the impact of our donations. Effective altruism is not about doing <em>some</em> good, it is about doing <em>the most</em> good with the limited resources that we\u00a0have.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Cost_Effectiveness\">Cost-Effectiveness</h2>\n<p>One\u2019s choice whether or not to donate is a matter of life or death for another person. But so is the decision as to where to donate. When we choose one charity over another, both of which run life-saving programs, we consign some people to death so others can\u00a0live.</p>\n<p>Even just comparing medical interventions, some are 1,000 times more effective in the suffering they can avert per dollar donated.<sup><a href=\"#fn:dcp2\">1</a></sup> A large donation to an ineffective charity that uses it to save one life would then mean that 999 more people die unnecessary deaths. Few of us have a choice between donating $100 and $100,000, but we all have the option to donate to the most effective charities rather than waste almost our whole\u00a0donation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Cause_Neutrality\">Cause\u00a0Neutrality</h2>\n<p>These considerations apply to nonhuman animals as much as to humans. There is no agreed-upon method for comparing the suffering of different species, but Animal Charity Evaluators estimates that the cost for saving the lives of farmed animals<sup><a href=\"#fn:ace-topcharities\">6</a></sup> might be four orders of magnitude less than that for saving human lives,<sup><a href=\"#fn:gw-ce\">4</a></sup> a consideration that might outweigh whatever lower value one might assign to the life of an animal. On the other hand, animals are much less likely to benefit from long-term flow-through effects.<sup><a href=\"#fn:ocb-animals\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p>Similarly, effective altruists are investigating whether there are highly effective giving opportunities in areas that are usually deemed political. For example, opportunities within the <span>US</span> policy areas of labor mobility and criminal justice are being investigated by the <a href=\"http://www.openphilanthropy.org/\">Open Philanthropy Project</a>. It also investigates types of global catastrophic risk (also known as <em>existential risk</em>)\u2014such as biosecurity and geoengineering\u2014and what can be done to avert them. Investigations into giving opportunities in the area of scientific research funding are also on the\u00a0agenda.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Charity_Prioritization\">Charity\u00a0Prioritization</h2>\n<p>Some charities address life-threatening issues; others address less severe problems but do so at lower costs; still others combine both advantages, but are already well funded. Most charities, however, improve lives in less significant ways and at high costs, for example due to using ineffective or poorly researched interventions. With all these factors to bear in mind, and additional complications such as differences in the quality of the evidence, it is a challenging task to prioritize\u00a0charities.</p>\n<p>Two organizations have put years of work into doing just that. <a href=\"http://givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> and <a href=\"http://animalcharityevaluators.org/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a> have been determining empirically which charities excel in all these categories. These charities are thus the best giving opportunities for donors. The reliability of their evidence is paramount to them, and they go to great lengths to subject their reasoning to public scrutiny, so that they can continually\u00a0improve.</p>\n<h3

Skypeing with new members is also really helpful as it lets us to get to know our members a bit better, and lets us know more more about who is taking the pledge and why.</p>\n<p>Over the last few months I have hosted two social events for members, a dinner in London in October, and a dinner in November to celebrate Giving What We Can\u2019s fifth anniversary.\u00a0 Both of these events were a lot of fun.\u00a0 I think that having more in person events to allow members to get to know one another in person is really important.\u00a0 If you would like to organize a meet up or event in your local area, I would be happy to help! \u00a0Email me at: jonathan.courtney@givingwhatwecan.org</p>\n<p>Perhaps one of the less glamorous, but no less enjoyable parts of my job is sending out the physical pledge letters to all of the new members of Giving What We Can.\u00a0 As those of you who have signed up know, shortly after you take the pledge, you receive a letter in the mail welcoming you, discussing our recommended charities in a bit more detail, and giving you a physical pledge form that you can sign and keep as a keepsake.\u00a0 While this is a small gesture, I really enjoy it as it is a physically tangible representation of Giving What We Can\u2019s membership growth.\u00a0 It is always great to see membership numbers grown on our <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/dashboard\">dashboard</a>, but somehow it feels more real when I am sending out pledge forms!</p>\n<p>One of the other great aspects of my role is that it allows me to give presentations for many our UK Chapters.\u00a0 Its great not only because I can share Giving What We Can\u2019s research and perspective with people who haven\u2019t heard of it before, but it also gives me a chance to meet and interact with some of the amazing chapters we have all over the UK. I will talk about these presentations in more detail in my next post.</p>\n<p>Along with my other main actions I occasionally branch out to try some other projects.\u00a0 One recent venture was participating the <a href=\"http://www.projectforawesome.com/\">The Project for Awesome</a>, which is a online fundraising campaign hosted by famous youtubers John and Hank Greene.\u00a0 With the help of several amazing Giving What We Can members, we were able to get a bit of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNHht8pS5L0\">visibility</a> thought the project, and we are excited to give an even more impressive video next year! \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Help me do better!</em></p>\n<p>These are a few of the things that keep me busy as the Director of Community, but I would love to have your feedback!\u00a0 One of the best things about working for Giving What We Can is that we are constantly looking to improve and are flexible enough to shift our time and energy to whichever actions look the most promising.\u00a0 If you have ideas about projects or actions which you think would be highly effected, either in growing the community, or just promoting Giving What We Can more generally, feel free to send me an email at: jonathan.courtney@givingwhatwecan.org</p>\n<p>These last few months have been really great, and I look forward to continuing to help to grow the Giving What We Can community in the coming months!</p></div></div>"},

The <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/11/18/our-updated-top-charities-for-giving-season-2015/\">list for 2015</a> comprises <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Malaria_Foundation\">Against Malaria Foundation</a> (malaria bednet distribution), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GiveDirectly\">GiveDirectly</a> (unconditional cash transfers), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deworm_the_World_Initiative\">Deworm the World Initiative</a> (deworming), and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis_Control_Initiative\">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a> (deworming). GiveWell's recommendations have acquired the status of a gold standard for conventional, unattached donors, and GiveWell has a particularly strong reputation among many of the people who read this site and identify as effective altruists. GiveWell also works closely with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Ventures\">Good Ventures</a>, the private foundation of Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife Cari Tuna. Good Ventures has made significant donations to GiveWell's top charities, mostly at GiveWell's suggestion, with the amount reaching <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Ventures#Grants_to_GiveWell-recommended_charities\">$44.4 million</a> (plus $1 million to standout charities, plus a separate three-year $25 million grant to GiveDirectly) in 2015.</em></p>\n<p>In a recent post on the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/969102686479422/\">Effective Altruists Facebook group</a> critiquing what I saw as claims of take-off exponential growth of the EA movement, I noted some estimates of what I believe GiveWell's money moved will be for 2015 and the years to come. In this post, I want to develop and refine those estimates more.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"TL_DR\">TL;DR</strong></p>\n<p>[Added at request of commenters, even though I'm skeptical that this TL;DR can accurately capture the entirety of the post].</p>\n<p>For simplicity, this TL;DR does not describe the intervals of uncertainty. For those you'll have to read the whole post (or the appropriate section thereof).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Forecasting the amount of money moved by GiveWell helps donors understand their marginal impact. It also helps recipient organizations and fundraisers.</li>\n<li>GiveWell and its recommended charities are currently a very small fraction of the sectors within which they operate. There are no hard ceilings being hit just yet.</li>\n<li>I estimate GiveWell's non-Good Ventures money moved to grow by a little over 40% from 2014 to 2015, though there is considerable uncertainty. I believe that Elie's estimate of well over 20 million dollars in money moved is a tad overconfident.</li>\n<li>I believe that GiveWell's growth in money moved this year will come partly from an increase in the number of donors (about 20%) and partly from an increase in the amount of money donated per donor (about 20%). In future years, growth will be concentrated more in terms of money moved per donor rather than number of donors, though both will grow modestly.</li>\n<li>I see three key determinants of GiveWell's money moved: discovery/brand awareness, conversion, and retention/upsell. The biggest constraint on GiveWell's money moved is poor conversion. The biggest source of near-term growth is retention/upsell. While discovery/brand awareness is low, increasing it significantly won't help much since conversion is a bigger bottleneck and will be an even bigger bottleneck if brand awareness were suddenly increased.</li>\n<li>GiveWell's choice of top charities itself affects its money moved, and the 2015 list of top charities is most conducive to moving more money.</li>\n<li>The long-run solution to the conversion problem is expanding the range of recommended charities, but this is unlikely to happen in a meaningful way for at least the next two years.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong id=\"Why_is_this_important_\">Why is this important?</strong></p>\n<p>GiveWell was an early proponent of the idea of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_for_more_funding\">room for more funding</a>, and of the closely related concept of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalism\">marginal impact</a>, i.e., what effect does your marginal contribution have? In order to best estimate an organization's room for more funding, GiveWell tries to estimate how much the organization will raise from non-GiveWell donors, and also takes into account the amount it is recommending that Good Ventures donate. However, GiveWell doesn't provide official guidance on how much money it expects GiveWell-influenced donors other than Good Ventures to give. I believe that carrying out this estimation is important for a few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It tells donors the relevant margin at which their donation is actually happening</strong>: One of the biggest determinants of marginal impact is how much money would be moved in the absence of your donation. [Mathematically, if we think of marginal impact in terms of the derivative of the impact function, then knowing how much money would be moved otherwise tells us at what point we need to take the derivative.]</li>\n<li><strong>It helps recipient organizations plan better for the future</strong>: Knowing how much money they expect to raise can help the organizations budget appropriately for staff and programs. Overestimates could lead to taking up too many programs that they then cannot follow through, whereas underestimates can lead to significant opportunities being underfilled.</li>\n<li><strong>It helps fundraising organizations and individuals understand the margins at which they are operating</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It could still be the case that while accurate answers are helpful, wild speculation isn't. But getting to accurate answers itself requires practice at estimation and forecasting, even if initial forecasts are of low quality. This post is an attempt at initial forecasts, along with a walkthrough of the reasoning used to generate the forecasts. The forecasts might well be of low quality, but I hope people find the exercise illuminative.</p>\n<p>In addition to the value of the final forecasts, the reasoning used in arriving at the forecasts helps shed light on other facets important to donors, recipient organizations, charity evaluators, and fundraising organizations.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"The_amounts_of_money_moved_are_now_sufficiently_significant_that_this_sort_of_analysis_is_worthwhile\">The amounts of money moved are now sufficiently significant that this sort of analysis is worthwhile</strong></p>\n<p>As GiveWell's donor base has increased in size and its annual money moved has hit eight digits, estimation makes more and more sense. A few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With more donors and larger amounts, more accurate forecasting becomes more possible (with the caveat that a billionaire here or there could tip the scales). Explicitly, with a larger number of donors, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers#Strong_law\">law of large numbers</a> starts kicking in. Moreover, if donors are donating larger amounts, the proportional variation in the amounts they donate is likely to be less (because the difference between donating $10,000 and $20,000 for a donor is more significant than the difference between donating $10 and $20).</li>\n<li>The recipient organizations have now demonstrated room for more funding according to GiveWell, and are planning their expansion operations specifically with the expectation of raising money from GiveWell. In particular, Against Malaria Foundation and GiveDirectly seem to be expanding rapidly with GiveWell playing a key role in their growth. While a lot of GiveWell's contribution comes through Good Ventures grants, individual donors play a nontrivial part for both organizations.</li>\n<li>GiveWell itself holds considerable promise as a pioneer of the idea of effective altruism (broadly construed, not necessarily to be equated with the eponymous social movement or this website). Understanding the growth of its money moved can shed insight into just how far the idea of effective altruism can go in the world of philanthropy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong id=\"An_overall_sense_of_magnitude\">An overall sense of magnitude</strong></p>\n<p>To give some sense of the numbers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Money donated to charity in the United States is about <a href=\"http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=42#.Vmyy_MoqSmM\">350 billion dollars a year</a>, which is a little over 2% of US GDP, which in turn is around 15-20% of Gross World Product.</li>\n<li>GiveWell's non-Good Ventures money moved to top charity was <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/04/13/givewells-money-moved-and-web-traffic-in-2014/\">$12.7 million-$13.0 million in 2014</a>, which is around 0.004% of total money moved to charity in the United States. GiveWell doesn't officially publish distribution of donors by country (I did write to them and they said they currently don't have that data) but my guess is that over half of its money moved comes from US donors, and possibly a lot more. So, excluding Good Ventures, GiveWell is responsible for moving somewhere between 0.002% and 0.004% of money moved to charity in the United States. Or viewed another way, total money moved to GiveWell-recommended charities in 2014, excluding money from Good Ventures, represented 0.00001% of gross world product.</li>\n<li>Based on various surveys of EA organizations and data published by EA organizations, my guess is that somewhere between 10% and 30% of money moved by GiveWell was through people who got to GiveWell through the EA movement. I won't elaborate on this point much here because it's not the focus of my estimation exercise, but you can check out the <a href=\"http://eahub.org/sites/effectivealtruismhub.com/files/survey/2014/results-and-analysis.pdf\">2014 EA Survey results</a> for some example data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What about GiveWell-recommended charities? Here are some rough estimates I got with a few minutes of Googling; numbers may be far from accurate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Against Malaria Foundation works in the domain of bednet distribution. Prior to 2015, it had raised less than 20 million dollars in total (a large part of it from Good Ventures and others influenced by GiveWell's recommendations, plus some influenced by Giving What We Can recommendations). With the new influx of Good Ventures and GiveWell-influenced money, its annual revenue could be in the tens of millions of dollars. For comparison, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, a Gates Foundation-backed and internationally supported grantmaker, spends between 2 and 5 billion a year, and devotes about 20% of its expenses to fighting malaria (according to <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/charities/gfatm\">GiveWell's page on them</a>). The estimate would therefore be that it spends between 400 million and 1 billion dollars on anti-malaria programs. Thus, prior to 2015, AMF accounted for less than 1% of global philanthropic expenditure against malaria, whereas it could now go up to anywhere between 2% and 10% (depending on how the other numbers shake out).</li>\n<li>GiveDirectly is the only non-governmental organization devoted to large-scale unconditional cash transfers, and it's not immediately clear what to compare it against. As a fraction of the economy of the countries it operates in, it's small but not as insignificant as it is for the sending economies. For instance, its annual expenses in Kenya are under 0.1% of Kenya's nominal GDP, but more than 0.01%.</li>\n<li>I wasn't able to get good estimates of the total money spent on deworming, but since SCI and DtWI (and in particular DtWI) work with governments, the money leveraged by their efforts is significantly more than their own money spent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These broad estimates show that in terms of money moved, fraction of the philanthropic sector, fraction of the wealth in donor groups, and fraction of the resources available to recipient groups, GiveWell and its top charities are still quite small. This suggests that there is considerable upward room to grow without hitting hard limits. Barriers to growth can of course arise in a variety of ways, but even so, there is no strong evidence against the proposition that, over the next few decades, GiveWell's annual non-Good Ventures money moved can grow by 1-2 orders of magnitude, while still remaining a small fraction of the quantities involved. For instance, GiveWell cited the <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2010/07/20/the-money-for-good-study/\">Money for Good study</a> (funded to help rethink the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_Marketplace_Initiative\">Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative</a> of the Hewlett Foundation) and noted that, based on interpretation, somewhere between $550 million and $4 billion in annual giving in the United States could be influenced by GiveWell-like resources. This would be somewhere between 0.2% and a little over 1% of annual giving in the United States, and represents a 40-200X increase in the non-Good Ventures money moved by GiveWell.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Money_moved_estimates\">Money moved estimates</strong></p>\n<p>A few relevant pieces of information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/04/13/givewells-money-moved-and-web-traffic-in-2014/\">Money moved in 2014 blog post</a>: This said that $12.7 million of non-Good Ventures money was moved in 2014. Later estimates upped this to $13.0 million.</li>\n<li>Impact data: <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/about/impact\">GiveWell's impact page</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GiveWell#Money_moved\">Wikipedia page section</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/09/09/update-on-givewells-web-traffic-money-moved-q2-2015/\">Money moved for Q2 2015</a> (the most recent period for which public data is available): This said that $1.5 million had been moved in the first two quarters from new donors, and a total of $5.56 million was moved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My estimates for the non-Good Ventures money moved by GiveWell have changed slightly since my <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/969102686479422/\">Effective Altruists Facebook group post</a>; here are the revised estimates.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Estimate for 2015: Median estimate of $18.7 million, 50% probability estimate of $16.2 million to $24.5 million.</li>\n<li>Estimate for 2016: Median estimate of $25.3 million, 50% probability estimate of $17.5 million to $37.5 million.</li>\n<li>Estimate for 2017: Median estimate of $30.1 million, 50% probability estimate of $19.5 million to $58 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In contrast, according to an <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/about/official-records/board-meeting-31\">October 2015 board meeting</a>, Elie Hassenfeld of GiveWell was confident that it would move over 20 million dollars in 2015. I believe this confidence is misplaced, for reasons I discuss below (with that said, the 20 million+ scenario is about 40% likely, so it's not way off from my estimate). But it is also possible that they have insider information that I lack access to. That is part of the reason for my upward revision of my estimates since the Facebook post.</p>\n<p>For the 2015 money moved estimate, here are some more details before I delve into my reasons.</p>\n<p>Here is the distribution by percentile:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1st percentile: $8.8 million</li>\n<li>2.5th percentile: $11.6 million</li>\n<li>10th percentile: $14.7 million</li>\n<li>25th percentile: $16.2 million</li>\n<li>50th percentile: $18.7 million</li>\n<li>75th percentile: $24.5 million</li>\n<li>90th percentile: $28.6 million</li>\n<li>97.5th percentile: $33.1 million</li>\n<li>99th percentile: $45 million</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is the distribution for top charities (50% probability for each):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Against Malaria Foundation: $8 million - $17 million</li>\n<li>GiveDirectly: $1 million - $4 million</li>\n<li>Schistosomiasis Control Initiative: $1 million - $4 million</li>\n<li>Deworm the World Initiative: $250,000 - $4 million</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The low lower-end estimate for Deworm the World Initiative arises from the fact that it raised less money last year, and the increased endorsement of the organization happened at the same time that GiveWell doubled down on AMF as a top pick. Moreover, Good Ventures has agreed to fill its entire Level 1 funding gap, making it less attractive for individual donors who take GiveWell's analysis serious.</p>\n<p>Here's the size distribution of donors for 2012, 2013, and 2014 (from the <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/04/13/givewells-money-moved-and-web-traffic-in-2014/\">same GiveWell blog post</a>).</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://files.givewell.org/files/images/Table_ByDonorSize.png\" alt=\"GiveWell money moved by size bucket\"></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We see that 2013 was a significant increase year for number of donors, whereas 2014 was an year when the number of donors didn't increase much (there was a lot of churn) but the average money moved per donor increased significantly. I believe that the situation for 2015 will look positive on both fronts: an increase in the number of donors, and an increase in the money moved per donor. My median estimates for the growth on both fronts is around 20%. Explicitly, my 50% interval for the number of donors in 2015 is 9,500-12,500. My 50% interval estimate for the money moved per donor is $1,500-2,000.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Explanation_of_the_lower_and_upper_end_estimates\">Explanation of the lower and upper end estimates<br></strong></p>\n<p><em>Explanation of the lower end</em>: Since GiveWell has already moved $5.56 million in money in the first two quarters of 2015, and Elie was reasonably confident of the 20 million figure for the whole year, I expect that donations did not completely stop in Q3 of 2015. Therefore, I expect that just the first three quarters alone would have accounted for at least $6.5 million in donations. That leaves about $2.3 million in potential donations for the end of year, which is fairly easy to achieve with existing pledges. Therefore, I expect a probability of about 1% of missing the $8.8 million mark. That 1% covers major scandals at GiveWell and its recommended charities, or other unforeseen problems.</p>\n<p><em>Explanation of the upper end</em>: The upper end of estimates is mainly governed by factors such as wealthy donors, highly successful fundraising groups or celebrity endorsements or media publicity, and other unforeseen factors.</p>\n<p>With the lower and upper end taken care of, I'll focus on explaining the middle. Specifically, I want to explain why my median estimate is lower than the \"well over 20 million\" that Elie and Holden have put out.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"A_quick_theoretical_model_for_how_GiveWell_moves_money\">A quick theoretical model for how GiveWell moves money</strong></p>\n<p>One thing seems reasonably clear to me from many different sources of anecdotal evidence:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here's my description of the most typical pathway for a GiveWell donor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The person discovers GiveWell through some method such as search, friend referral, social media, or a website or person they follow online.</li>\n<li>The person checks out GiveWell's site, and hears positive things about GiveWell.</li>\n<li>When Giving Season (concentrated around December) arrives, the person checks out GiveWell's recommendations, and in some cases makes a donation to a GiveWell-recommended charity on GiveWell's recommendation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on this model, a few key determinants of GiveWell's money moved stand out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Discovery and brand awareness</strong>: How many new people are discovering GiveWell? What is the total number of people who know about GiveWell and what it stands for? I did a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/975114889211535/\">Facebook post on a SurveyMonkey Audience survey of brand awareness of various philanthropic organizations</a>. GiveWell did decently okay but way below the Gates Foundation, and also below the relatively recent Chan Zuckerberg Initiative as well as Charity Navigator.</li>\n<li><strong>Conversion</strong>: For the people who have heard of GiveWell, how likely is the person to go through GiveWell's recommendations when considering a donation, and how likely are they to actually follow through? This to me seems like the biggest <em>filter</em>, since for many people, GiveWell's philosophy and areas of focus just don't resonate. They just aren't interested in the causes GiveWell's top charities are in. Interestingly, this includes many in the EA community (such as those who find animal welfare or existential risk way more important) plus more conventional donors with their own causes of interest (environmentalists, donors who prefer keeping money local, etc.) GiveWell is <em>not an impulse buy</em>. GiveWell doesn't move much money from people who casually Google for where to donate money, land on GiveWell's site, and immediately buy. Fundamentally, since GiveWell is asking people to donate to charities that they probably hadn't heard of and weren't considering explicitly, it takes some time to get them to actually donate. It also takes time to understand the broad philosophy motivating GiveWell's decisions. This is in contrast with, say, Charity Navigator, that you might go to in order to check out a charity you are already interested in, and then, after reading the review, decide to donate or not donate (it's hard to say whether Charity Navigator <em>caused</em> the donation, but it did influence the donation decision somewhat). For more on a comparison between the immediate appeal of GiveWell and Charity Navigator, see <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/975661115823579/\">my Facebook thread discussing the results of a SurveyMonkey Audience survey</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Retention and upsell</strong>: For the people who are already donating to GiveWell, how likely are they to return next year, and will the amount they donate keep going up? While this partly depends on how good they find GiveWell, it also depends on how much money they're making. If GiveWell captures potential donors when they are young and starting their careers, its donor base will see an increase in per capita income and therefore will probably move larger sums of money per donor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the beginning of my investigation, I believed that the focus should be on discovery and conversion. This partly stems from my pro-web bias, where short-run pageviews are both the most important and fairly decent proxies for long-run pageviews. However, after I dug deeper into the data, I now believe that the main driver of GiveWell's growth in the near term is retention and upsell. My upshot:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Discovery and brand awareness</strong>: GiveWell still has a long ways to go before people have vaguely heard of it and are vaguely aware of it. However, progress in recent years has been lukewarm at best. A lot of GiveWell's media coverage to date was back in 2008 in the wake of the MetaFilter scandal (!), and even in recent years, GiveWell received more attention on some metrics in 2011 and 2012 than it does now. With that said, there seems to have been one discrete but permanent bump in July 2014. 2015 appears to be mostly flat along some metrics, but rising along others, painting a decidedly mixed picture.</li>\n<li><strong>Conversion</strong>: I believe 2015 will see higher conversion than previous years because of more careful coordination among GiveWell allies to move money to GiveWell-recommended charities, plus other reasons I discuss below.</li>\n<li><strong>Retention and upsell</strong>: GiveWell seems to have succeeded at the upsell in 2014. This seems to me to be largely a result of GiveWell donors getting richer (and therefore moving up the size buckets), but it could also be due to other factors such as increased confidence in GiveWell recommendations. Partly, this is also a signal of GiveWell not doing that well at attracting newer donors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong id=\"Discovery_and_brand_awareness\">Discovery and brand awareness<br></strong></p>\n<p>While we don't have money moved or GiveWell web traffic data from August 2015 onward, we do have other pieces of data that we can use to understand GiveWell's growth.</p>\n<p>I combine <a href=\"http://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?page=GiveWell&amp;allmonths=allmonths\">pageview counts for the Wikipedia page about GiveWell</a> with GiveWell's <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17-vzAl3p8D4Gm0btrAbOEy42lqdAkyivQcZmtM24034/edit#gid=0\">spreadsheet</a> with data on the number of unique visitors.

you dig into the Wikipedia pageviews more at <a href=\"http://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?page=GiveWell&amp;allmonths=allmonths\">the link</a>, you'll see there was a sharp increase in the latter half of July 2014. In fact, the date range for the increase can be narrowed to the period between July 11 and August 4. You can also check against <a href=\"http://stats.grok.se/en/201407/GiveWell\">stats.grok.se data</a>.</p>\n<p>For this reason, we see that three-month periods whose end dates are after August 2014 but before August 2015 show robust year-over-year growth, whereas three-month periods September 2015 onward show anemic growth in Wikipedia views.</p>\n<p>On these indicators, 2015 seems to be a year of flatlining. However, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F03h570b\">Google Trends data</a> suggests robust year-on-year growth from 2014 to 2015, up to and including November and December. I'm not really sure how much relative weight to place on Wikipedia view data versus Google Trends data. Since Google Trends methodology is less transparent, I'm a little more suspicious of it. But on the other hand, Google clearly has much more money and brains behind the quality of the data. Overall I would say the evidence for growth in 2015 (over and above whatever happened in the middle of 2014) is decidedly mixed. Either way, it is unlikely to be the driver of an increase in donations. If discovery and brand awareness were the only thing that I were looking at, I wouldn't estimate more than 10% increase in annual money moved. But I actually estimate a much greater increase (over 40%, with 20% being due to more donors\u00a0 and 20% being due to more money per donor). Why? Basically, conversion and upsell. Since these two are somewhat hard to separate, I'll discuss some changes in 2015 that I believe will positively affect both conversion and upsell, without separating conversion from upsell.</p>\n<p>I should also mention here some currently fledgeling efforts being made to increase brand awareness of GiveWell and the ideas surrounding it. Gleb Tsipursky wrote a Huffington Post listicle on the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gleb-tsipursky/8-secrets-of-savvy-donors_b_8792242.html\">8 Secrets of Savvy Donors</a>, and he <a href=\"/ea/qo/promoting_effective_giving_using_liststyle/\">reported in an EA Forum post</a> that it increased awareness and also converted at least one moderately influential person. It's too early to evaluate the significance of these for the 2015 Giving Season.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"The_role_played_by_the_specifics_of_GiveWell_s_recommendations_and_the_rhetoric_they_use\">The role played by the specifics of GiveWell's recommendations and the rhetoric they use<br></strong></p>\n<p>There is a reasonable argument that the actual list of top charities, and the commentary that GiveWell makes when recommending them, itself affects how much money is moved to them. The top charity list hasn't changed since the 2014 giving season. But there are a few important differences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For February-November 2014 (the first ten months of the year), the top charity list didn't include the Against Malaria Foundation. (GiveWell announced in October 2014 that AMF had established room for more funding again, however it officially updated its list only at the end of November). <em>Ceteris paribus</em>, it seems that giving AMF more prominence in recommendations increases money moved, because AMF seems naturally more appealing to GiveWell donors (it's doing something that saves lives applying a proven intervention). AMF has been in GiveWell's list for all of 2015, so it's had more time in the limelight.</li>\n<li>In its top charity announcement in 2015, GiveWell has explicitly doubled down on AMF, asking donors to direct all their money to AMF. This clarity of message is likely to inspire unattached donors to give more. Note that GiveWell finds room for more funding in all its top picks, so those determined to give to another charity will not be dissuaded from giving entirely.</li>\n<li>GiveWell has identified larger amounts of room for more funding in all its top charities relative to previous years, and Good Ventures has made substantially larger grants this year than in previous years. This recommendation anchors individual donors to give more and makes them more likely to donate, as long as they feel somewhat positively about at least one of the top charities [On the flip side, it may make individual donors more reluctant to fund something that already has so much money behind it. However, as an empirical matter, this seems a relatively minor concern among GiveWell donors]. This will most significantly affect upsell rather than conversion, but as noted earlier, upsell is a bigger short-run source of increase in money moved than conversion of new donors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Indeed, as described in the <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/12/09/staff-members-personal-donations-for-giving-season-2015/\">2015 staff members' personal donations blog post</a>, most of GiveWell's staff are donating all or most of their own annual money to AMF, with Holden and Elie in particular donating all their money to AMF. In contrast, in <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/12/staff-members-personal-donations/\">previous</a> <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/12/17/staff-members-personal-donations-giving-season-2014/\">years</a>, GiveWell's own staff members were more skeptical of the ranking or relative allocation suggested by GiveWell, and opted for a different mix. GiveWell's staff also expressed more confidence in 2015 (justified or not) in the rigor of the process used to evaluate top charities and their room for more funding. For instance, co-founder and co-executive director Elie wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Last year, we gave significantly more to GiveDirectly than GiveWell recommended because I put less weight on cost-effectiveness analysis than other staff. I remain ambivalent about putting so much weight on cost-effectiveness estimates because they are subject to numerous debatable assumptions, but I\u2019ve changed my mind based on work we did over the past few months. We put significant effort into debating <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/Interventions/GiveWell_cost-effectiveness_analysis_2015.xlsx\">our cost-effectiveness model</a> (.xls) and encouraged all GiveWell staff to input their own values into the model. The resulting strong consensus that cash is significantly less cost-effective than bednets/deworming persuaded me to put more weight on cost-effectiveness analysis in my giving this year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, Alexander Berger notes his increased confidence in the recommendations and how much AMF strikes him as a great opportunity:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/12/17/staff-members-personal-donations-giving-season-2014/\">What I wrote last year</a> is even more true this year: I think our recommendations this year are stronger than they were last year, and I\u2019m excited to support them. And since I\u2019ve been (even) less involved in our top charities research this year than in previous years, I\u2019m also inclined to just follow the recommended GiveWell allocation (i.e. 100% to AMF).</p>\nI\u2019m particularly struck this giving season by just how strong a recommendation AMF is. We believe that AMF can fairly reliably fill a gap in global bednet coverage and avert child deaths for something on the order of every $3,000 donated. I\u2019m much more skeptical than some of my colleagues about how much we can learn from our cost-effectiveness models, particularly for deworming, but I see the case for bednets as being quite strong. And even if we are off by a factor of several times, which I think is absolutely possible, I see that as remarkably cost-effective: for comparison, <a href=\"http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/risk/downloads/RiskSeminar_2008-09-23_Robinson.pdf\">common estimates</a> put the value of a statistical life in the United States at around $5 million.</blockquote>\n<p><strong id=\"Increased_coordinated_doubling_down_on_GiveWell_recommendations_by_its_allies\">Increased coordinated doubling down on GiveWell recommendations by its allies</strong></p>\n<p>One major thing I see being done at a larger scale in 2015 is coordination by organizations that seek to move money to GiveWell top charities through careful marketing and messaging. GiveWell, which has historically remained very detached from efforts to spread the word about its top charities, has given a more explicit nod to fundraising efforts explicitly aligned with the goal of raising money for its top recommended charity. For instance, their Outreach Associate Catherine Hollander (the position didn't even exist last year) wrote a blog post recently on <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/12/10/encouraging-friends-and-family-to-give-to-amf-for-the-holidays/\">fundraising for AMF, the top charity</a>. Charity Science's fundraising operation also appears to have matured this year, as exemplified in their <a href=\"/ea/qd/why_eas_should_do_charity_sciences_christmas/\">post providing guidance for Christmas fundraisers</a>. Giving What We Can also seems to have upped its social media presence and the publicity surrounding its Pledges. While not all the money moved through this will be attributed to GiveWell, it may raise the profile of GiveWell and move some money explicitly attributed to GiveWell.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"More_on_the_distribution_of_money_moved_to_top_charities\">More on the distribution of money moved to top charities</strong></p>\n<p>In 2014, AMF was not in the top charity list till the end of the year, but still raised $4.4 million from non-GV donors, higher than any other charity. This year, AMF was a top charity throughout the year, and GiveWell identified as the sole charity that it recommended GiveWell-aligned donors to give to. GiveWell itself, and its allies, are picking on AMF as the focal point of fundraising campaigns. AMF is also intrinsically appealing to GiveWell donors, since it's a scalable implementation of a proven intervention that saves lives. For all these reasons, I believe that AMF will raise the most money among GiveWell-recommended charities by a huge margin. Moreover, the uncertainty around money moved to AMF accounts for most of the uncertainty in total money moved.</p>\n<p>I believe the other charities will generally receive money from people who have strong prior reasons for wanting to donate to the charities, with the GiveWell recommendation playing a Charity Navigator-like role of validating the organization's legitimacy. For instance, GiveDirectly excites a large number of effective altruists, due to the simplicity, non-paternalism, strong organizational growth, and significant scalability. People with whom these values resonate will likely continue to donate to GiveDirectly and use the huge funding gap GiveWell has found for the organization to bolster their case. Similarly for SCI and DtWI. It's also important to note that since the doubling down on AMF happened in November, the first few months probably saw a larger share of donations to these other charities.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Growth_in_coming_years\">Growth in coming years</strong></p>\n<p>Most of my discussion so far has been focused either on general models for money moved or what'll happen in 2015. However, my primary interest is in understanding growth over the next 5 or more years. The reason I devoted so many pixels to 2015 is that the statements I make about 2015 will be tested against reality in fairly short order, and I believe this calibration against reality will be crucial to evaluating my credibility.</p>\n<p>Let's get back to three determinants of GiveWell's money moved: discovery and brand awareness, conversion, and retention/upsell.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Discovery and brand awareness</strong>: I believe that this is low, but I don't believe that increasing it right now will do much. I think increasing brand awareness will do very little till the deeper problem of low conversion is solved. As the surveys I did showed, GiveWell brand awareness is low but not <em>that</em> low. It's particularly high among people who already use Charity Navigator, and yet, most of the people who are aware of GiveWell don't actively use it.</li>\n<li><strong>Conversion</strong>: 2015 might already be a peak in terms of the extent to which the charities convert people. I think that, over the timeframe of the next two years, there's a greater chance that AMF, SCI, DtWI, or GiveDirectly would run out of room for more funding as judged by GiveWell than that GiveWell will find another promising charity to which it recommends moving a comparable amount of money. I also believe that fundraiser coordination is also reaching close to the best it can achieve in squeezing out money. I think we are already nearing the long-run bottleneck on conversion: <em>GiveWell charities just don't resonate with enough people</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Retention and upsell</strong>: There is a momentum effect here arising from the fact that GiveWell got a large number of young donors in its early years. The income and giving potential of GiveWell donors will continue to increase over the next few years, so that alone will be a driver of growth. I don't believe this will run out for the next 2-3 years, but it could run out after that if GiveWell doesn't add enough new donors with high earning potential in the pipeline.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The upshot: most of the growth in money moved to GiveWell top charities in the next two years will come from retention and upsell. More concretely, this means that the number of donors probably won't increase that much from 2015 to 2016 and 2017, but the money moved per donor will continue to increase, largely because of an increase in donors in high size buckets (and mostly this will be donors who donated smaller amounts in earlier years). More concretely, I expect the number of donors to increase by 10% per year for the next two years (2015 to 2016 and 2016 to 2017) and I expect the money moved per donor to increase by about 20% and 15% in the coming two years. A <em>lot</em> of this will come from the highest donation size buckets, via phenomena such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founders_Pledge\">Founders Pledge</a> donations.</p>\n<p>I don't think the time is right to spell out the model in detail. I'd like to see how close my 2015 predictions are to reality and uncover any biases in how I'm thinking about things before elucidating a plausible story for the next few years.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Implications\">Implications</strong></p>\n<p>To the extent that I believe the median case of my forecasts, it leaves me with mixed feelings. I believe that there is wisdom in having larger numbers of eyeballs engaging with the data and recommendations. The idea of growth being propelled more by retention than by user growth is a negative as far as quality is concerned. On the other hand, assuming some rationality on the part of donors, larger sums of money moved per donor incentivizes each donor to care more about their donations, and could in principle put more scrutiny on GiveWell. I believe that the former effect significantly outweighs the latter at the present margin, particularly because a lot of the growth in money moved per donor comes from donors just getting richer, rather than deciding to donate a larger <em>fraction</em> of their income to charity.</p>\n<p>I also think the continued short-run increase in money moved to GiveWell top charities reduces the incentives for GiveWell to expand to more domains and undertake the hard task of finding new areas to donate to. This limits their long-term appeal (in particular, it puts a ceiling on how much conversion they can accomplish), but more importantly from a social welfare perspective, it limits the fraction of the donor population and the fraction of donor money that will be influenced by the kind of deep analysis that GiveWell strives to do. (With that said, Charity Navigator-level or GuideStar-level analysis of charities has taken off in a decent way and is probably informing over 1% of money moved already, but that's not the same type of analysis since it's based on a much smaller, though still important, set of metrics).</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong>: In a <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/12/10/december-2015-open-thread/comment-page-1/#comment-934738\">blog post comment on December 23</a>, Elie Hassenfeld reported that as of December 22, GiveWell had moved $15.7 million in non-Good Ventures donations to its top charities. My original estimates did not include this information, but accounting for it would move the lower end of my estimates upwards somewhat while not significantly affecting the higher ends.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong>: In a <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2016/01/08/update-on-givewells-web-traffic-money-moved/\">blog post on January 8, 2016</a>, Tyler Heishman reports GiveWell's Q3 2015 money moved and also provides a preliminary estimate of the money moved between February and December 2015. This doesn't include money that might be moved in January 2016, though that is unlikely to materially affect the estimates much since the bulk of money moved is in December. Heishman reports that $28 million in money moved from sources other than Good Ventures is attributable to GiveWell. This is close to the 90th percentile in my estimate range ($28.6 million). So overall, my estimates were quite conservative, and it may have been possible to more accurately make higher estimates. With that said, my identification of the potential reasons for the money moved being a lot higher than my median estimate was broadly correct. As I wrote above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The upper end of estimates is mainly governed by factors such as wealthy donors, highly successful fundraising groups or celebrity endorsements or media publicity, and other unforeseen factors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The GiveWell blog post says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Excluding Good Ventures, we have tracked about $28 million (of which, roughly half has come from donors giving $1 million or more).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hence, at least the \"wealthy donors\" part seems right.</p>\n<p>Moreover, I expect that the other predictions I made should roughly hold up with appropriate rescaling to the greater amount of money moved, but also accounting for the increased variability due to a small number of large donors.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 3</strong>: Catherine Hollander <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2016/03/10/march-2016-open-thread/comment-page-1/#comment-938025\">linked</a> to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rIpnWtuYSfsjLWkJMO5FTOQE6SRGzJnnyFgyKSwIKOM/edit#gid=0\">almost-final estimates</a> of money moved by charity and size bucket. The total non-Good Ventures money moved was about $33.37 million (versus about 13 or 14 million last year, and a 50% confidence interval of $16.2-24.5 million in my post). Within the distribution specified in my post, the amount actually moved fell at the 97.5th percentile.</p>\n<p><em>Size buckets</em>: Money from those giving over $100,000 (including both the $100,000-$999,999 bucket and the $1,000,000+ bucket) was about $20.29 million, versus $4.42 million last year. Excluding these heavy donors, the money moved was $13.4 million, compared to about $8.4-10 million last year. The money moved per donor was $2,157.</p>\n<p>I believe my primary source of error in estimates was at the high end. I correctly predicted that the money moved per donor would increase, but I underestimated the extent to which the total money moved by donors giving in excess of $100,000 would increase. If the giving in these buckets had increased in the same proportion as the giving in the sub-$100,000 buckets, the money moved would have been within my 50% interval. With that said, I also underestimated somewhat the sheer volume of donors: my 50% estimate for the number of donors was 9,500-12,500, whereas the actual number was 15,468.</p>\n<p><em>Donations by recipient charity</em>: Here, too, my estimates were off, but not systematically so. Three of the four top charities (Against Malaria Foundation, Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, and Deworm the World Initiative) fell in my 50% intervals for those charities (with AMF, at almost 15 million, being at the higher end of its range but still within it). The one outlier was GiveDirectly. My 50% estimate for GiveDirectly was between 1 and 4 million dollars, but actual money moved appears to have been over 13 million dollars. This is interesting in that it was unexpected not only to me but also (probably) to many other GiveWell watchers. It was also contrary to the message that GiveWell was focused on spreading, namely, that donating to AMF should be the top priority.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 4</strong>: Natalie Stone-Crispin of GiveWell has <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2016/04/06/givewell-research-plans-for-2016/\">just published</a> a blog post on the GiveWell blog providing insight into GiveWell's research plans for 2016. Some of these updates are related to predictions I made, and make me more confident that my thinking was in the right direction. In my Facebook post that had been the original impetus for this Effective Altruists group post, I had said that GiveWell's top charities are unlikely to change in 2016, and Natalie's just-published post strengthens my view that the top charity list is likely to stay the same (with possible temporary removal of some top charities because of exhaustion of room for more funding or concerns about scaling challenges). GiveWell is also looking into switching focus from identifying top charities to outreach, something that I had not made a prediction on in either direction.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 5</strong>: On Friday, May 13, 2016, GiveWell finally released the final report on money moved in 2015. I have published a <a href=\"/ea/xn/givewell_money_moved_in_2015_a_review_of_my/\">new post</a> going over my forecasts, how they compared with reality, and implications.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclosure</strong>: I am not financially affiliated with GiveWell, but have some past and ongoing association with them.

It\u2019s valuable to conduct at least a quick exploration of these to see if they merit further investigation. As part of our </span><span><a href=\"http://rationality.org/2014/01/13/an-impressive-failure/\">commitment to transparency</a></span><span>, we publish detailed notes on what we find so that the whole effective altruist community can learn from it.</span><span>\u00a0I\u2019ve done some initial research into corporate fundraising, and here is a write-up of this.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"Avenues_pursued\"><span>Avenues pursued</span></h2>\n<p><span>I aimed to spend relatively little time on this unless it proved promising. I did only a couple of hours of initial research, followed by a few hours Skyping and corresponding with the most promising opportunity that I identified. So there is scope for more research, and this appears worth doing once we\u2019ve exhausting more promising avenues; we plan to do this if we receive sufficient funding to keep Charity Science running or to expand it.</span></p>\n<p><span>I searched for general writings on corporate fundraising, focusing on those which spoke to how promising it was overall. I used Google and particularly good websites on fundraising that we\u2019d previously identified; I did not look at books in this brief research. My colleagues Joey and Xio and I have Skyped with several fundraising professionals and asked them about corporate fundraising among other things. Joey and Xio put considerable effort into identifying the best fundraising experts - they received paid consultancy from the best they could find, and have read his book, which covers corporate sponsorship of events. This is not covered in these notes as we class it under events fundraising, which we plan to scale up this year after a successful experiment with it.</span></p>\n<p><span>I Skyped with Luchang Wang about a project that some members of </span><span><a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/groups/yale-effective-altruists\">Yale Effective Altruists</a></span><span>\u00a0have done in which they spoke to people at specific companies, for instance those involved in corporate social responsibility at major US pharmacy CVS, which notably removed tobacco products from its stores. They initially hoped to influence where companies donated, but their conversations cast some doubt on the prospects for this. </span></p>\n<p><span>I conducted a very shallow search for websites offering help with corporate fundraising. I identified one which appeared worth pursuing: </span><span><a href=\"http://charity.org/\">Global Impact/charity.org</a></span><span>. I had an email exchange with them, then decided it was worth Skyping, and then had a further email exchange. I describe this below.</span></p>\n<p><span>There are a few avenues that I found that I plan to investigate further, though as a relatively low priority. I identified </span><span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ashoka.org/about\">Ashoka</a></span><span>\u00a0(a network of social entrepreneurs) as worth investigating further given that we have a contact there, and will describe what we find later. We also have someone who writes and edits books on corporate fundraising in our network, and I am waiting to talk to them.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"General_findings\"><span>General findings</span></h2>\n<p><span>I found consistent advice that the typical forms of corporate fundraising require the charity to have something worth offering to the company, such as an ability to reach a valuable audience through (for example) prominently sponsoring a charity event. This was echoed in what the Yale group heard in their conversations. I do not yet have solid evidence for it however.</span></p>\n<p><span>Some of what I read indirectly suggested that corporate fundraising was best suited charities serving people in the developed world (where many corporations major customer bases are). But in my call with Global Impact I asked them whether international development charities could expect success, and they said that they could. They gave the example of extractive corporations (such as Exxon Mobil) which focus on malaria, which affects their workforces.</span></p>\n<p><span>I talked to an EA who works as a management consultant and got GiveWell recommendations included in the list of charities donated to at his company. He suggested that it would be helpful to have glossy, persuasive materials on the charities from Charity Science, and we plan to create those. It seems possible that EAs working within companies could influence corporate or workforce giving, and we plan to gather more evidence on this, likely including encouraging people to try it out and helping them.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"The_most_promising_opportunity_that_we_found\"><span>The most promising opportunity that we found</span></h2>\n<p><span>Global Impact provides paid services to both charities and companies interested in corporate social responsibility. For companies, these include (but are not limited to) running a workplace giving scheme and advising on choosing charities in a favoured area. For charities, these include (but are not limited to) offering participating in their workplace giving scheme, helping with corporate fundraising (including identifying promising corporations to approach), designing and implementing fundraising strategies (including foundation identification and research), and secretarial services.</span></p>\n<p><span>We identified several of these services as worth investigating. The most promising was the workplace giving scheme, as this moves a great deal of money and reaches an enormous number of employees at </span><span><a href=\"http://charity.org/public-sector\">major state and federal agencies</a></span><span>\u00a0and </span><span><a href=\"http://charity.org/corporations\">corporations</a></span><span>\u00a0(such as American Express, Amazon, Intel JP Morgan, McDonalds, Microsoft and Shell). It is worth looking at these lists to get a sense of its scale. As is normal, it was difficult to pin Global Impact down on how much we could expect to raise. However, after some discussion they said: \u201cJust to give you an estimate, charities in our federation that have gross revenues of between $3-5 million and are with us for both public and private sector campaigns, average approximately $20,000 in pledges per year.\u201d This was in response to my asking them to give an estimate for AMF, given that spends around \u00a32,000,000 ($3.1m) a year. They were very familiar with AMF, knowing the people involved.</span></p>\n<p><span>This appears promising, and it is possible that it could raise significant amounts of money for some of the world\u2019s most effective charities. However participation costs $2,500 a year (as well as a 5% commission on donations). We feel that we do not have sufficient evidence to justify this expenditure. Among other things, Charity Science is not in a financial position to take punts which have a good chance of not paying off, even if in expectation they will have a large positive impact.</span></p>\n<p><span>The other services that we identified as worth exploring were identification of promising corporate donors to approach, and designing and implementing a fundraising diversification strategy. The most promising element of the latter was foundation identification and research; however we identified and applied to promising corporate foundations during our unsuccessful early (six month) experiment with grant-writing, and this has lead to our seeing them as not particularly promising. We were quoted $10,000 to $15,000 for the first service and $5,000 to $25,000 for the second. We do not regard this as worth paying; I am more confident of this than I am for the workplace giving scheme opportunity.</span></p>\n<p><span>An important caveat to the above is that it is quite hard to judge how promising these opportunities are. We tend towards an unusually pessimistic view, and I am not at all confident that this is correct. I would welcome others\u2019 comments and suggestions, as well as promising avenues to explore or contacts we could get in touch with.</span></p></div></div>"},

Paul's involvement in SPARC made\u00a0buying\u00a0teaching there complicated, and it\u00a0would already have been\u00a0difficult\u00a0to separate the teaching from\u00a0others'\u00a0work on SPARC.\u00a0Inducing the translation of papers also seemed too hard to separate from actually translating the papers, without much more access to exactly what happened between the participants.\u00a0The value of mentoring EAs seemed too hard to assess.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Purchased_projects\">Purchased projects</h4>\n<p>We evaluated the other five projects, and it looked as if we would buy the two that we did. We then\u00a0evaluated those two somewhat more thoroughly.\u00a0Here are summaries of our\u00a0evaluations for them.</p>\n<h5>Ben Kuhn's blog post on donation matching</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>We estimate that EAs and\u00a0other related groups move around $500k annually through donation matching. We are thinking of drives run by MIRI, CFAR, GiveDirectly, Charity Science, Good Ventures,\u00a0among\u00a0others.</li>\n<li>We think a full and clear\u00a0understanding of donation matching would improve this by around\u00a0$6k, through such drives being better optimized. We lowered this figure\u00a0to account for the data being less relevant to some matching drives, and costs and inefficiencies in the information being spread.</li>\n<li>We think this work constitutes around 1/30th of\u00a0a\u00a0full and clear understanding of donation matching.</li>\n<li>We\u00a0used a time horizon of three years, though in retrospect it probably should have been longer. This implicitly included some general concerns about the fraction of people who have seen it being smaller in the future, and\u00a0information accruing from other sources and conditions changing, and so on.</li>\n<li>We get $6,000 * 3 years / 30 = $600 of stimulated EA donations</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Oliver Habryka's organization of HPMOR wrap parties</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>We estimate that around 1300 people went to wrap parties (adjusted somewhat for how long they were there for). This was based on\u00a0examining the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/ltd/hpmor_wrap_parties_resources_information_and/\">list of events</a> and their purported attendances, and a few quick checks for verification.</li>\n<li>We estimated\u00a0Oliver's impact was 1/4 of the impact of the wrap parties. We estimated that the existence of cental organization doubled the scale of the event, and we attributed half of that credit to the central organization and half of the credit to\u00a0other\u00a0local organizers\u00a0and non-organizational inputs (which also had to scale up).</li>\n<li>We estimated that the attendance of an additional person was worth\u00a0around\u00a0$15 of stimulated EA donations. This was a guess based on a few different lines of reasoning.\u00a0We estimated the\u00a0value of the\u00a0EA/LW community in stimulated donations, the value of annual growth,\u00a0and the fraction of that growth that comes from outreach (as opposed to improving the EA product, or\u00a0natural social contact), and the fraction of outreach that came from the wrap parties. We also guessed what fraction of people\u00a0were new, and would become more involved in the EA/LW community as a result, and would end up doing more useful things on our values as a result of that. We sanity checked these numbers\u00a0against the kind of value participants probably got from the celebration individually.</li>\n<li>Thus we have 1300 * 15 /4 = $4,875 of stimulated EA donations, which we rounded up to $5,000.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that while we evaluated\u00a0both items in terms of dollars of stimulated EA donations, these numbers don't have much to do with real dollars in the auction\u2014their only relevance is in deciding the ratio of value between different projects. So systematic errors one way or the other won't much matter.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Notes_on_our_experience\">Notes on our\u00a0experience</h3>\n<h4 id=\"Quick_estimates\">Quick estimates</h4>\n<p>It was tough\u00a0to evaluate things fast enough to be worth it given how little we were\u00a0spending, while also being meaningfully\u00a0accurate. To some extent this is just a problem with funding small, inhomogeneous projects.\u00a0But we think it\u00a0will get better in the future for a few\u00a0reasons, if we or others do more of this kind of thing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Having a reference class of similar things that are already evaluated makes it much easier to evaluate a new project. You can tell how much to spend on a bottle of ketchup because\u00a0you have many similar ketchup options which you have already judged to be basically worth buying, and so you mostly just have to judge whether it is worth an extra $0.10 for less sugar or more food dye or whatever. If you had never bought food\u00a0before and had to figure out from first principles how much\u00a0a bottle of ketchup would improve your long term goals,\u00a0you would have more trouble. Similarly,\u00a0if we had established going prices for different kinds of research blogging, it would be easier to evaluate Ben's post relative to nearby alternatives.</li>\n<li>We will cache many parts of the analysis that come up often. e.g. how much is\u00a0it worth to attract a new person to the EA movement? And only make comparisons between similar activities.</li>\n<li>We will get better with practice.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"Shared_responsibility\">Shared responsibility</h4>\n<p>We <a href=\"http://impactpurchase.org/restrictions-2/\">said</a> we would not buy certificates for collaborative projects unless the subset of people applying had been explicitly allocated a share of responsibility for the project. Collaborative versus not\u00a0turned out to be\u00a0a fairly\u00a0unclear\u00a0distinction.\u00a0No\u00a0project was\u00a0creating objects of ultimate\u00a0value directly; so all of these projects are instrumental steps, to be combined with other people's instrumental steps, to make further, bigger instrumental steps.\u00a0Is a donation to GiveDirectly its own project, or is it part of a collaboration with GiveDirectly and their other donors? Happily, we don't care. We\u00a0just want to be able to evaluate the thing we are buying. So we were willing to purchase a donation to GiveDirectly from the donor, but not to purchase the output of a cash transfer from a GiveDirectly donor. In some cases it is hard to assess the value of one intermediate step in isolation, and then will be less likely to purchase it (or will purchase it only at a discount).</p>\n<h3 id=\"Call_for_more_proposals\">Call for more proposals</h3>\n<p>The next deadline will be April 25.

As well as deworming hundreds of children, it's an unusually good opportunity to find people who are interested in cost-effective charity and start conversations with them - something it's rare to find an excuse to do. Dozens of effective altruists and many\u00a0<a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/groups\">EA groups around the world</a>\u00a0are going to take part. Here are the details:</p>\n<div><strong>What:</strong> <span> Spend only $2.50 a day on food for three days. Get sponsored to raise money to fight poverty. (You'll find <a href=\"#what-if-diff-curr\">different figures for different currencies</a>.)</span><br> <strong>Why:</strong> Half of the world spends $2.50 or less on food each day. This reflects income levels at which people often can\u2019t afford basic health care. All money raised goes to buy medicines that cost only 50 cents. As readers of this forum will know, this is an exceptional opportunity to do good.<br> <strong>Who:</strong> People who want to do something to help the global poor and get a sense of what poverty's like.<br> <strong>When:</strong> April 22-24, 2015. If those dates don\u2019t work for you you can set your own. For example, if you're at a US university you can choose to do it on April 6-8, when some American college groups are doing it.<br> <strong>What you can vary:</strong> Any of this: the amount you spend, the number of days and the date. For example, see below for the \u2018challenge mode\u2019 of spending only $1.50.<br> <strong>How: </strong>Sign up via these links for <a href=\"http://canadaexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">the US</a>, <a href=\"http://canadaexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"http://ukexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">the UK</a>, <a href=\"http://ozexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"http://swissexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Switzerland</a>, <a href=\"http://sweexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Sweden</a> and the <a href=\"http://euroexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Eurozone</a>.

Most people will be touched by your dedication to helping those less fortunate and will be happy to help you out. <br> <br> Or you can just donate to the campaign! 50 cents buys a pill that treats a child for a whole year, so just $20 buys enough for 40 children.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>If you'd like to use a currency other than US dollars, you can use our pages for\u00a0<a href=\"http://canadaexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Canada</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://ukexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">the UK</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://ozexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Australia</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://swissexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Switzerland</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://sweexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Sweden</a>\u00a0and the\u00a0<a href=\"http://euroexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Eurozone</a>.</div>\n<div>\n<h1 id=\"Where_does_the_money_go__Deworm_the_World\">Where does the money go?\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.evidenceaction.org/dewormtheworld\">Deworm the World</a></h1>\n<div>All funds raised goes to Deworm the World, which gives out medicine that cures children who have parasitic worms. These parasites live inside your body and suck your blood. The effects include fatigue, bloody diarrhoea, fever, chills, and other such lovely symptoms. Rather understandably, being so ill leads to many sick days from school and work. In fact, this is why deworming is arguably one of the most cost-effective ways to give children an education, among other things (<a href=\"http://www.poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/miguel_worms.pdf\">Miguel and Kremer 2004</a>\u00a0found that it led to a 25% reduction in school absenteeism, although this is a difficult effect to pin down; for more details, see <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming#Whatarethebenefitsofmassdeworming\">this from GiveWell</a>).</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Effective altruists will be familiar with the case for fundraising for Deworm the World, as one of the charities that GiveWell recommends as the most effective in the world.

But that\u2019s kind of the point. It\u2019s to get a sense of how limiting $2.50 is. It\u2019s like running a marathon for charity, but a lot more related. <br> <br> However, it\u2019s not all abstinence. (That\u2019s reserved for the people taking the challenge mode who will spend only $1.50 a day.) Here\u2019s a few cheap meals people have tried in the past:<br> \n<ul>\n<li>Rice, beans, and spices or soy sauce</li>\n<li>Butternut squash pasta</li>\n<li>Ramen noodles (always a guilty pleasure anyway)</li>\n<li>Oatmeal with chopped banana</li>\n</ul>\nThings you\u2019ll have to give up:<br> \n<ul>\n<li>Starbucks or buying coffee out</li>\n<li>Restaurants</li>\n<li>Alcoholic drinks</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"What_are_the_rules_\">What are the rules?</h1>\n<span>The spirit of the event involves getting a (very rough) experience of poverty, and to ultimately make it so that fewer people have to have similar experiences. As long as it is done in this spirit, do what works for you. If you need to spend a bit more money, you can set your own amount. If you can\u2019t do it on April 22-24, do a different time. If you lapse during your three days, it\u2019s OK. You might even want to mention it on Facebook, talking about how difficult it was. It will help people understand how hard poverty is.<br>\n<h1 id=\"Why__2_50_\"><span>Why $2.50?</span></h1>\n<br> Half of the world lives on less than $1,368 a year. Around 65% of that is spent on food, which means $2.43 a day. We rounded to $2.50 a day because round numbers are nicer, but you can spend only $2.43 if you\u2019d like. <br> <br> You might have traveled to a poor country and know that you can buy more for $2.50 overseas. This is a good point, which is why the $2.43 figure is adjusted to how much $2.43 could buy in the USA in 2005. That\u2019s not much. Now imagine that you have to use the remaining $1.75 per day on shelter, transport, healthcare, and entertainment. That\u2019s why we\u2019re running this campaign. Because that\u2019s just too little and we want to change it. <br> <br>\n<h1 id=\"Challenge_Mode__live_on__1_50\">Challenge Mode: live on $1.50</h1>\nYawn. $2.50? You already did that in college. Well worry not my frugal friend, there is a challenge mode! $1.50 a day is roughly the international poverty line, so why not try to live on only that for 3 days? <br> <br> Why do the challenge mode?<br> <br> \n<ul>\n<li>People raise more when they suffer more. Yes, they did a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3613749/\">study</a> on this, and yes, people are strange creatures.</li>\n<li>You\u2019ll get a better sense of what extreme poverty is like.</li>\n<li>You\u2019ll get an e-high five from the Experience Poverty team.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"What_if_I_live_outside_the_US_\">What if I live outside the US?</h1>\nWe have separate pages with different currencies for the following countries:<br> \n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://canadaexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">The US</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://canadaexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Canada</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ukexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">The UK</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ozexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Australia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://swissexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Switzerland</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://sweexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Sweden</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://euroexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">The Eurozone</a></li>\n</ul>\nIf you don\u2019t live in any of those countries then you can either join the US page which will let your friends donate in dollars or you can <a href=\"mailto:mailto:tom@charityscience.com\">email us</a> to see if we can add your country.

There are therefore good reasons to ally ourselves with other rationalist memes to increase the level of rationality and effectiveness in the world. One powerful such rationalist meme is\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_policy\">\"evidence-based policy\"</a>, which is inspired by the\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine\">\"evidence-based medicine\"</a>\u00a0movement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The\u00a0exact meaning of evidence-based policy is somewhat disputed, but generally proponents of\u00a0evidence-based policy\u00a0demand that the standards on which policy is based should be raised. Many believe strongly in\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial\">randomized control trials</a>\u00a0(RCTs) and in the<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_evidence\">\u00a0\"hierarchy of evidence\"</a>, but there is not complete agreement on the strength of RCTs relative to other kinds of studies.</p>\n<p>In the US and the UK, there are several organizations which work on\u00a0evidence-based policy, such as the British\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/what-works-network\">What Works Network</a>\u00a0and the American\u00a0<a href=\"http://coalition4evidence.org/\">Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy</a>. Inspired by them, I took the initative to start a Swedish network for\u00a0evidence-based policy\u00a0at the start of this year. We are by now around 50 (depending on how you count) researchers, civil servants, journalists, consultants, students and other activists in the network. Only myself and a few others are EA members, so it's not an EA organization,\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/ic/the_effectivenessalone_strategy_and_evidencebased/\">but as I argued in my previous post</a>, I do believe working on this nevertheless is an effectively altruistic cause.</p>\n<p>One difference between us and What Works is that we aim to be a broad campaigning organization. We believe that policy not being evidence-based is not only due to a lack of knowledge, but also due to a lack of will, especially among politicians. Politicians often disregard expert advice (on what policies are the most effective to reach a given set of goals) which goes against their political prejudices.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore we need to put pressure on politicians - not the least in the media - rather than just work behind the scenes as an expert organization.</p>\n<p>II (Most\u00a0linked replies below are in Swedish)</p>\n<p>Our activities were fairly modest until last Sunday, when\u00a0<a href=\"https://stefanschubert.wordpress.com/2015/06/07/knowledge-must-trump-ideology-and-populism/\">we wrote an opinion piece</a>\u00a0calling for\u00a0evidence-based policy\u00a0(English). The opinion piece was published in the\u00a0most widely-read\u00a0broadsheet,\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagens_Nyheter\">Dagens Nyheter</a>, on DN Debatt - a sort of op-ed forum. DN Debatt has a special standing in Swedish politics. Everybody reads it and it's well-respected.</p>\n<p>Hence we had expected a lot of attention, but the results still exceeded them. Ours was the second most shared DN Debatt-article in the month of May. We got\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dn.se/debatt/kunskap-maste-ga-fore-ideologi-och-populism/\">seven replies in Dagens Nyheter</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.svd.se/de-designar-ditt-rostbeteende/om/ledare\">were strongly criticized</a>\u00a0in the other main broadsheet,\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svenska_Dagbladet\">Svenska Dagbladet</a>\u00a0(conservative),\u00a0<a href=\"http://sverigesradio.se/sida/avsnitt/569601?programid=4743\">parodied in a popular public service</a>\u00a0(equivalent of BBC) podcast, and were also commented on in a number of smaller newspapers. The discussion on Twitter was pretty intense. Subsequently, we also published two replies to replies in\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dn.se/debatt/repliker/vart-intresse-ligger-i-de-politiska-beslutsprocesserna/\">Dagens Nyheter</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.svd.se/evidensdebattorer-i-replik-desinformation-om-disputerade-despoter?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed\">Svenska Dagbladet</a>.</p>\n<p>It's hard to tell what the majority opinion on our piece was. Certainly, there was a lot of praise and a lot of Facebook likes, but also some\u00a0fierce\u00a0criticism. This was almost exclusively down to misunderstandings. I won't bog you down with all of the details here, but will rather summarize my general conclusions. They could be useful for anyone trying to write on evidence-based policy or related concepts in other countries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I should say that \"evidence-based policy\" isn't as entrenched a concept in Sweden as it is in the US and the UK, which probably played to our disadvantage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>1) You need to be very clear over the means-ends-distinction. Evidence-based policy is about making the methods for reaching your political goals (happiness, equality, liberty, etc) more effective by the use of evidence. It is not about propagating any particular set of political goals. We tried to be clear about this, but partly failed for two reasons. Firstly, Dagens Nyheter set the headline, which was misleading. Second, we only clarified this distinction at the end. It should have been at the top.</p>\n<p>2) There is a straw man conception of evidence-based policy, or expert-informed policy and political rationality more generally, akin to\u00a0<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/90n/summary_of_the_straw_vulcan/\">Julia Galef's \"Straw Vulcan\"</a>\u00a0conception of rationality. Perhaps this varies a bit from country to country, but in Sweden it's strong. Let's call it \"Straw Soviet\" for now (please come with suggestions!).</p>\n<p>According to this conception, evidence-based policy means technocracy (of a dictatorial form, according to the more extreme interpretations), disregard of non-quantifiable values (cf \"Straw Vulcan\"), disregard of emotions, \"Mad Scientist\"-conception of society as a labratory, etc, etc. You need to everything you can to counter such interpretations. I certainly underestimated the power of this straw man meme. I should also say that the Straw Soviet\u00a0is probably more vicious than the Straw Vulcan, who seems more innocent (perhaps this is partly down to Julia's plafyul presentation of it, though).\u00a0</p>\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"http://www.svd.se/de-designar-ditt-rostbeteende/om/ledare\">Svenska Dagbladet's criticism</a> was all about the \"Straw Soviet\". We\u00a0were said to want to \"design voter behaviour\" (this was also partly due to the article having been signed by a few <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory\">nudgers</a> who call themselves \"behavioural engineers\" - a big trigger of the Straw Soviet). Here are some more quotes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is perhaps not the \u201cenlightened despot\u201d who is called for in the opinion piece, but rather Dr Despot. Today\u2019s most frightening reading came from the recently formed \u201cNetwork for Evidence-Based Policy\u201d (Dagens Nyheter 1 June).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>//</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since there probably are very few citizens who base their votes on research reports, free elections yields results which are not evidence-based. According to the argument in the opinion piece, that means that since\u00a0we \u201csee the world through\u00a0partisan lenses\u201d, the election results are as a rule problematic or directly harmful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>//</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now if the network were correct, true evidence-based policies would lead to a single proposal, a solution \u201cfree from ideology and populism\u201d. That would in turn mean that all parties arrived at the same answer, and it is absolutely impossible why that \u2013 though ever so full of evidence \u2013 would be desirable.</p>\n<p>A vibrant democracy is based on the existence of conflicts of opinion and value, intellectual diversity and the citizen\u2019s right to freely express it. The complete and rational citizen is an anomaly, and based on the unpleasant idea that enlightened powers can raise, design, a new man.</p>\n<p>Paradoxically, it is precisely highly ideological regimes which have attempted just that. The results have been devastating.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We got several other replies along these lines, though we also got a <a href=\"http://www.dn.se/ledare/signerat/carl-johan-von-seth-politik-ar-inte-bara-att-tycka-och-onska/\">much more positive one from Dagens Nyheter itself</a>. A large group of replies treated more technical and hum-drum issues concerning RCTs, practical policy-making, etc.</p>\n<p>3) Connected to the Straw Vulcan and the Straw Soviet, there is a \"Straw Naive Positivist Scientist\" (again, suggestions for better terms are welcome), who thinks that knowledge is easily obtainable even in messy fields like economics, that it's easy to reach consensus if you just don't lead political misconceptions mislead you, that you always easily can infer policy-advice from research, etc. We got a lot of criticism which was based on the Straw Naive Positivist. Obviously, we don't hold any of those views.</p>\n<p>4) People read very superficially. This is not only true of the man in the street, but also of many journalists, politicians, etc. At some level I know this,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21612118-it-not-just-old-married-couples-who-talk-without-communicating-you-never-listen\">having myself written about research on this</a>\u00a0on my blog, but it's harder to make full use of that knowledge when you write.</p>\n<p>Also lots of people don't use the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity\">principle of charity</a> at all. Some of the replies - <a href=\"http://www.dn.se/debatt/kunskap-maste-ga-fore-ideologi-och-populism/\">including one from a philosophy professor</a> - were exceedingly uncharitable. Thus don't expect people to use the principle of charity - especially when emotional memes like the Straw Soviet are around.</p>\n<p>When you fight such powerful memes, you need to be extremely clear. You need to say the things you really want to get across early, to repeat them, and to give examples. If at all possible, you should control the title, since that sets so much of the tone of the piece (give the publishers a juicy suggestion and they might buy it). Don't say too much, but focus on getting the central message across.</p>\n<p>This is\u00a0so<em></em><strong><em>\u00a0</em></strong><em></em>different from writing an academic paper. Of course that's obvious, but it's one thing to get it on an intellectual level, quite another to really internalize it. If you could get a skilled public communicator on board, that would be very useful.</p>\n<p>I also think it would be good to pre-test major articles (e.g. on Mechanical Turk) to get a clearer picture of whether the message gets across. If you don't want the content to leak beforehand, that might not be doable, though.</p>\n<p>5) We were probably a bit too extreme regarding RCTs, which triggered the Straw Soviet and the Straw Naive Positivist (for epistemological and ethical reasons). It would have been more tactical to emphasize other stuff.</p>\n<p>6) We would have come off as more concrete if we had based our opinion piece on a research report on the state of Swedish policy-making.\u00a0It's great if you can do that, but I don't think it would have been rational for us (see below).</p>\n<p>7) We should have stressed how big the movement on evidence-based policy is in the US and the UK. For instance, we could have mentioned that <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/fixgov/posts/2015/02/04-obama-budget-evidence-based-policy-kamarck\">\"Obama's 2016 budget calls for an emphasis on evidence-based approaches at all levels of government\"</a>. Obama being popular and respected in Sweden, that would have done much to disarm the Straw Soviet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>8) It was a mistake to mention legal means as a way of making politics more evidence-based, since it strongly triggers the Soviet meme. Even those who otherwise supported us criticized this suggestion.</p>\n<p>III</p>\n<p>In our replies, we focused on rectifying the misunderstandings, focusing on the claim that we are calling for \"Dr Despot\". These replies normally gets much less attention, and so it was with ours as well. However, the reception also was more\u00a0<a>unanimously</a>\u00a0positive, especially from academics and civil servants who know the field.</p>\n<p>I don't regret writing this opinion piece at this early stage. Before I started writing it (I wrote the body of the text, and the others then made minor tweaks) there wasn't much activity in our network. Now, we have many more members, including more senior ones. Also, those who already were in the network grew much more enthusiastic after the publication. Thus all-in-all it's been a major success. Still, I think you can learn a lot from things we could have done better.</p>\n<p>I'll write more later on how the network is developing more generally.\u00a0Also I should add that I'm still digesting what I've learnt, so my conclusions aren't set in stone. Any comments are welcome.</p>\n<p>[Edit: Added #7, #8]</p></div></div>"},

I will first review the arguments for giving insects moral consideration; my main argument is that if insects have any reasonable chance of being sentient, the sheer number of insects we have an effect on necessitates their moral consideration. I will then focus on a feasible way to reduce potential insect suffering, which is the subsidization of humane pesticides. I will conclude that this approach is the marginally best cause-area because of its cost-efficiency, minimal bureaucratic needs, and dearth of people focusing on it. I will also attempt to dispel some concerns that focus on humane pesticides will lead to reduced pesticide use overall, which would potentially cause more insect suffering in the long-term. </span></p>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Paper : </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span><strong><span> <span> </span></span>Why Insects are Morally Relevant</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>I will put forward two arguments for considering insect suffering. The first is that insects are sentient, thus making them worthy of moral consideration. By \u2018sentience\u2019 I mean phenomenal consciousness, which is the ability to have subjective internal experiences. (Note that I am assuming that sentience and ability to feel pain are the necessary factors for moral consideration. Anyone who thinks this is not the case, or thinks that animals don\u2019t deserve moral consideration will be unconvinced by this argument) While I personally believe that insects are sentient, I don\u2019t think this belief is necessary to advance the claim that we ought to support humane pesticides. My second argument is that if there is even a small chance that insects are sentient, the number of insects in existence is so large that we should take measures to avoid potentially harming them. This assumes William MacAskill\u2019s position that in cases of moral uncertainty, we ought to maximize expected value</span><span>. There are other schools of thought on how one ought to act when the moral status of a being is uncertain, but settling that dispute is beyond the scope of this paper. This argument places the deciding factor instead on insects\u2019 percent chance of sentience, meaning that even if someone thinks insects are probably not sentient they still ought to support humane pesticides.</span></p>\n<p><span> Insects engage in many behaviors that suggest they have an internal, subjective experience, and are thus sentient. Insects exhibit clear aversion to negative stimuli, which itself suggests they experience pain</span><span>. However, this does not rule out the possibility that insects are more like a simple computer program than a sentient being. Very few people would consider a simple reinforcement algorithm as having an internal experience, so we require something else in the way insects respond to pain that suggests an internal experience over a machine-like negative reinforcement loop. </span></p>\n<p><span>One fact which suggests sentience is insects\u2019 response to bodily harm while under the influence of morphine. Insects produce natural opiates in a way similar to humans</span><span>, and show much less reaction to injury when under the influence of artificial opiates. \u201c... crustaceans, insects, and mollusks show less reaction to a noxious stimulus when they receive morphine. For example, morphine reduces the reaction of mantis shrimps to electric shock, praying mantises to electric shock, and land snails to a hot surface.\u201d (</span><span>Speciesism, </span><span>128). The administration of morphine seems to be hampering some kind of decision procedure that insects use to respond to harm. Rather than having an instantaneous aversion to harm, insects seem to be evaluating a sensation internally, then deciding on a certain response (in this case, moving away from said stimulus). Of course, morphine could be inhibiting some reflexive response to harmful stimuli rather than dulling an internal experience. For example, in humans spinal reflexes can generate responses to harmful stimuli with no conscious input, such as withdrawing one\u2019s hand away from a flame. Insects have been shown to react to harmful stimuli even when their peripheral nervous system is isolated from their central nervous system</span><span> (analogous to the spinal cord and brain respectively). Distinguishing between reflexive responses and an actual experience of pain is difficult, and I don\u2019t expect to settle the question here. \u00a0However, insects exhibit certain behaviors that suggest their pain is more than simple reflexive responses. In </span><span>A Question of Pain in Invertebrates</span><span>, bioethicist Jane Smith suggests which behaviors can help us distinguish between reflexes and pain. \u201c ...</span><span>animals may also learn in the future to avoid situations similar to the one in which the pain occurred. Such responses, while not proof that the animals have experienced pain, can indicate that something more than a simple nociceptive reflex is involved\u201d</span><span>. </span><span>If we accept that learning is suggestive of subjective experience, insects exhibit learning responses that suggest they experience pain. In a 1972 study on fruit fly larvae, larvae were successfully trained to avoid odorants released in conjunction with an electric shock</span><span>. </span><span>This not only suggests that insects have an internal experience, but more importantly an experience of pain and suffering. </span></p>\n<p><span>Other behaviors further the case that insects experience phenomenal consciousness. Bees are capable of remembering task-relevant information in simple working-memory tests</span><span>. Ants are able to recognize and cooperate with ants from the same colony, even across continents</span><span>. Cockroaches display negative psychological effects when socially isolated at birth</span><span>. Studies on insects\u2019 social behavior are particularly compelling, as they suggest a certain degree of self-consciousness inherent in any social structure. Considering this evidence, I would find it odd if beings that respond to psychoactive drugs, are capable of learning, and form reasonably complex social structures weren\u2019t capable of feeling pain. Thus, because it is more likely that insects are sentient we ought to give them moral consideration. I\u2019m very aware of my position as an interested amateur and not an entomologist, and I concede that I could be wrong about insect sentience. Because of this, I\u2019ll also advance the more substantial claim that the sheer number of insects requires us to give them moral consideration with even a small chance of sentience. </span></p>\n<p><span>There are roughly 10^18 insects in the world</span><span>. Suppose we give insects a .1% chance of being sentient, with their sentience being .1% of a human\u2019s. (These values are intentionally small to demonstrate the scale to which insect suffering dominates) Assuming we assign moral weight to categories of beings by their number and the intensity of their inner experiences, this assignment gives each insect 1/1,000,000 of the moral weight for a human, meaning that the suffering of 1,000,000 insects equals the suffering of one human. Even when assigning insects this absurdly low moral weight, their suffering still dominates, as 10^18 insects comes out to 1 trillion human equivalents. If the number of insects were smaller, say around 7 billion, the consequences of not considering insect suffering might be acceptable. Unfortunately this isn\u2019t the case, and as we shall see, ignoring insect suffering even if we assign a low probability to insect consciousness presents an unacceptably high risk of ignoring a catastrophic moral harm.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span> </span><strong>Potential Argumentum Ad Abusrdum\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Before we continue, I\u2019d like to address an argumentum ad absurdum my line of reasoning is subject to. Some may argue that my argument requires people to focus on alleviating suffering for increasingly strange categories. There are more bacteria than insects, so even if we give bacteria a small percent chance of sentience, we should focus on alleviating bacteria suffering. This can continue almost indefinitely, eventually generating the conclusion that we should focus all our resources on alleviating electron suffering. There are two options for avoiding such absurd conclusions, which I will explain by using the electron example as a test case. </span></p>\n<p><span>There are 10^80 electrons in the universe</span><span>. Because the number of electrons is so large, even if we assign an extremely small chance of sentience to electrons we ought to be taking measures to reduce their suffering. One option to this argument is to bite the bullet and accept the dominance of electron suffering. Some may opt for this option, but I find this conclusion absurd enough to discredit my argument. To salvage my argument, I must \u00a0demonstrate that electron suffering doesn\u2019t dominate all other considerations. The first argument against this is simply that the percent chance of electrons\u2019 being sentient is low enough that their potential suffering doesn\u2019t dominate. This argument works, but it requires that we assign an extremely low chance of sentience to electrons. Furthermore, if we think of sentience as a gradient, electrons are likely orders of magnitude less sentient than insects. I personally think this is the case, but many would object that assigning such a low probability to these events is inherently absurd. Our second argument doesn\u2019t disprove the dominance of electron suffering, but instead addresses the practical difficulties of preventing electron suffering. In other words, we have no idea of what constitutes suffering to an electron. Arguments trying to extrapolate electron preferences from their physical behavior (like saying they prefer to be closer to protons) are analogous to saying that humans prefer to be closer to the earth rather than far away from it because of gravity. The amount of money and energy it would require to figure out potential sources of electron suffering are immense, and the chances of success low. Likewise, the resources it would take to prevent electron suffering would be exorbitant. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span><span><strong>Analysis of a Potential Humane Pesticides Intervention</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Of course, finding large sources of suffering is only one part of cause-prioritization; we must also make the case that there are effective interventions that can reduce said suffering. In this section, I will be focusing on the intervention specified in Brian Tomasik\u2019s </span><span>Humane Insecticides</span><span>, which is the subsidization of less-painful pesticides. I will make the case that this intervention is the most marginally effective cause, scaling linearly per dollar spent and asymptotically per additional person working for it. Also, it is my understanding that Brian Tomasik thinks we shouldn\u2019t advocate for humane pesticides, lest our arguments be taken as being against pesticides in general. I hope to dispel these concerns, making the case that the harm that may come from distortion of our views is less than the harm we fail to prevent by doing nothing.</span></p>\n<p><span>As we have just seen, there is a strong argument that insects are sentient. We have also established that valuing one insect at 1/1,000,000 of the value of a single human still results in 1 trillion human equivalents at any given moment. If insects really are sentient, by doing nothing we are ignoring potentially the largest source of suffering that currently exists. Effective Altruism has lived up to its name by choosing cause areas that address the largest sources of suffering. Suffering in farmed animals dwarfs human suffering, and is itself dwarfed by potential suffering in the far future. One trend I\u2019ve noticed is that as the size of the suffering increases, we accept more uncertainty in how much effect our actions will have, making the choice between focusing on animal advocacy vs. existential risk difficult despite ex-risk\u2019s suffering space being much larger. Insect\u2019s suffering space is much larger than farmed animals yet humane pesticides offers much less uncertainty about whether our donations have their intended effect. </span></p>\n<p><span>Subsidization of humane pesticides is described in detail in Brian Tomasik\u2019s </span><span>Human Insecticides</span><span>,</span><span> and I recommend reading it for an in-depth explanation of this intervention. The intervention described involves simply paying farmers to use more humane pesticides. Brian estimates this intervention to cost one dollar per 250,000 less-painful deaths</span><span>. For comparison, The Humane League prevents around 8.8 animals from existing on factory farms per dollar</span><span> spent on advertising, and the Against Malaria Foundation prevents 1 child death per every $3,340 spent on malaria nets</span><span>. To make comparing these numbers easier, let\u2019s assume insects have a 1% chance of being sentient, with their degree of sentience being 1% of a human\u2019s. With these values, humane pesticides saves 25 human equivalents from a more painful death per dollar. Depending on how we value a less painful death, subsidizing human pesticides is competitive (or even superior) with the most effective animal and human related interventions. This intervention would likely consist of subsidizing a switch from growth-regulators, pathogens, and parasites to neurotoxins, which entomologist Jeff Lockwood tentatively ranks as less painful than the former methods</span><span>. I also recommend focusing on neurotoxins because of their standard effect across all species of insects. Other interventions, such as habitat destruction and use of predators, only affect targeted insect species. It is possible that most insects have lives that aren\u2019t worth living could potentially make the situation worse. meaning the fewer insects in existence the better. I\u2019m uncertain about whether this is the case, but arguments</span><span> for this position raised enough doubt that I decided to account for this possibility. It also seems like most people focusing on wild animal suffering think this is the case, so I\u2019ve decided to operate under this assumption. Pesticides that kill all species of insects rather than a targeted few are much more likely to reduce the overall insect population, which should produce a larger gain in utility. </span></p>\n<p><span>Subsidization of humane pesticides is also the most efficient use of our human resources. First of all, the intervention described would require comparatively little bureaucratic support. A theoretical insect-charity would need to 1) locate farms using more painful pesticides, 2) distribute the subsidies to targeted farms, and 3) perform some kind of follow-up to ensure the humane pesticides are actually being used. Such an intervention would require an extremely low burden of proof, which would consist of the check that the subsidized pesticides are actually being used. Implementing this intervention would only require finding the farms and distributing the subsidies, which could be easily handled by a small team of people working full-time. Compared to other animal-charities, a charity doing the intervention described would need far fewer people to help a far greater amount of animals with much less ambiguity as to whether their efforts had the intended effect. (I think this paragraph can be slotted into the previous one - we\u2019ll talk about this). </span></p>\n<p><span>Furthermore, I think the flow-through effects of subsidizing humane pesticides could be extremely valuable. As I\u2019ve hopefully driven home, insect suffering probably dominates all other sources of suffering. Despite this, I cannot name a single person doing something concrete to alleviate insect suffering. Entomologists such as Jeff Lockwood seem to be thinking seriously about whether insects suffer</span><span>, but aren\u2019t concentrating on interventions to prevent said suffering. The only people (or rather, person) who seems to be thinking seriously about this subject is Brian Tomasik. One person thinking about how to alleviate suffering for 10^18 organisms seems like a dangerously inadequate level of attention (though I\u2019m not entirely surprised by this; it\u2019s a weird topic). Promoting humane insecticides not only has the direct effect of giving insects more humane deaths, it also helps normalize concern for insect and wild animal suffering. More importantly, it helps normalize concern for wild animals in accordance with EAA ideals. Aside from Animal Ethics, the only charities that come close to being about wild animals are all focused on habitat preservation, which many EAAs think is the exact opposite of what will decrease wild animal suffering. Another important flow-through effect is that such an intervention would help us gain more knowledge on how switches from one pesticide to another affect insect population levels. From my limited understanding, most research along these lines seems to only measure the populations of targeted bugs. Subsidies would provide more opportunities to measure the effects of different pesticides, helping us develop a better understanding of what the most humane method really is. </span></p>\n<p><span>As a last note, I\u2019d like to address concerns that publicly supporting such an intervention would be misunderstood as being against all pesticide use. Currently, effective altruist views on wild animal suffering have zero traction among the general public. The only people who are publicly concerning themselves with the issue are focusing on habitat preservation, which might be the worst possible intervention to decrease wild animal suffering. I think we shouldn\u2019t worry about making the problem worse because the opinions exactly opposite ours already dominate all public conversation on the topic. We are already in the worst-case-scenario. Furthermore, I think that if we are careful about how we market ourselves, we can avoid misinterpretation. Explicitly stating \u2018We are not against habitat destruction. We are not against pesticide use. We simply want animals to die less painful deaths\u2019 seems hard to misconstrue. A mission statement along these lines seems more agreeable to the general public than the current rhetoric around pesticides. I\u2019m not sure of the exact opinion polls on this, but I would imagine the general public is more in favor of pesticide use than not, and stating that we actually support some pesticide use is amenable message than hard line anti-pesticide advocacy. </span></p>\n<p><span>In conclusion, even if we assign a low probably of sentience to insects, their potential suffering dominates most other sources. Switching to humane pesticides saves an enormous number of insects from painful deaths, has a low burden of proof to demonstrate effectiveness, and helps normalize concern towards wild animal suffering. More importantly, publicly advocating for humane pesticides provides an essential counterpoint to other organizations focused on wild animal suffering. I\u2019m not fully convinced that most wild animals have lives not worth living, but I am convinced that the standard anti-pesticide, pro habitat preservation stance needs to be seriously questioned. Subsidizing humane pesticides takes us from zero to one on wild animal suffering, making it the best use of marginal resources.</span></p></div></div>"},

So three years ago,\u00a0\u00a0with risk analyst Tony Barrett, he cofounded the Global Catstrophic Risks Institute - one of the handful of places working on these particularly important problems. Since then, it's done some academic outreach and have covered issues like <a href=\"http://sethbaum.com/ac/2013_DoubleCatastrophe.pdf\">double-catastrophe</a>/ <a href=\"http://sethbaum.com/ac/2013_AdaptationRecovery.html\">recovery from catstrophe</a>, bioengineering, food security and AI.</p>\n<p>Just last week, they've updated their strategy, giving the following announcement:</p>\n<p>Dear friends,</p>\n<p>I am delighted to announce important changes in GCRI\u2019s identity and direction. GCRI is now just over three years old. In these years we have learned a lot about how we can best contribute to the issue of global catastrophic risk. Initially, GCRI aimed to lead a large global catastrophic risk community while also performing original research. This aim is captured in GCRI\u2019s original mission statement, to help mobilize the world\u2019s intellectual and professional resources to meet humanity\u2019s gravest threats.</p>\n<p>Our community building has been successful, but our research has simply gone farther. Our research has been published in leading academic journals. It has taken us around the world for important talks. And it has helped us publish in the popular media. GCRI will increasingly focus on in-house research.</p>\n<p>Our research will also be increasingly focused, as will our other activities. The single most important GCR research question is: What are the best ways to reduce the risk of global catastrophe? To that end, GCRI is launching a GCR Integrated Assessment as our new flagship project. The Integrated Assessment puts all the GCRs into one integrated study in order to assess the best ways of reducing the risk. And we are changing our mission statement accordingly, to develop the best ways to confront humanity\u2019s gravest threats.</p>\n<p>So <strong>7pm ET </strong><strong><strong>Tuesday</strong>, March 3</strong> is the time to come online to the EA Forum and post your questions about any topic you like, and Seth will remain online until at least 9 to answer as many questions as he can.</p>\n<p>On the topic of risk organisations, I'll also mention that i) <a href=\"http://cser.org/gain-of-function-influenza-research-lecture-online/\">video is available</a> from CSER's recent seminar, in which Mark Lipsitch and Derek Smith's discussed potentially pandemic pathogens, and ii) I'm helping Sean to write up a more detailed update for LessWrong and effective altruists which will go online soon.</p></div></div>"},

To see them, we cite <a href=\"http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/papers/moral-trade.pdf\">Ord</a> (In press): </span></p>\n<p><span> </span><span>Different self-regarding tastes allow for gains from trade. For example, if two children would prefer to eat each other\u2019s packed lunches, they can trade them and both benefit. Similarly, if people have different moral views, they can potentially realise gains from moral trade, making them both think that their moral view is better satisfied if they make a trade than if they don\u2019t. For example, consequentialists may think that the trade produces a better outcome, while deontologists may think that it better fulfils their duties or that it is a supererogatory option. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>As Carey pointed out while reviewing this: </span></p>\n<p><span>People do not behave in an entirely self-interested manner, and economists are often tempted to model people as though they are. Utility in economics is used to mean something different from how it is usually understood, which is at best confusing, and at worst distorts the discourse. [We can][</span><span>...] call into question the notion that what society common-sensically calls a person is necessarily one agent in the economic sense. Instead, you want to say that a person is made up of lots of desires, which might be subagents themselves (picoeconomics) that they might be the same as temporally distant similar people (UDT/TDT), and that their other-regarding beliefs should not be excluded from analysis, or from efforts to build robust institutions to fulfil these values.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>In traditional economics, monolithic self-interested agents that have full personal identity over time perform trade, make contracts and create firms in order to satisfy their preferences, especially with regards the consumption of goods and services. Over time, the opportunities for increased efficiency offered by the division of labour becomes a strong incentive for cooperation even if agents are mostly self-interested, so alliances and groups become more likely. Negative externalities frequently generate tragedy of the commons type dilemmas, a multiplayer version of prisoner\u2019s dilemma (Ingmar &amp; Savulescu 2013). </span></p>\n<p><span>There are many ways in which the assumptions of traditional economic models can be challenged. For altruists and moral philosophers, some of these are worth pointing out, not as critique of the homo economicus model, which has been done thoroughly and at this point would be attacking a strawman, but merely to increase the saliency of some aspects of economics that will be useful to reason about altruistic economics. Let us look at them in turn.</span></p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Heuristics and Biases</span><span>: famously associated with Kahneman and Tversky , this subfield has lead to many predictive models at the individual as well as the social level.

Instead he contends that there is a dispute between different time slices of the same individual, and they too perform trade and bargain at the sub-personal level. His model makes different mathematical predictions of what an individual would deem an acceptable trade or not and has also been empirically corroborated as a better model of what humans actually do than the Homo Economicus strawman, though alternative models have </span><a href=\"http://wolfweb.unr.edu/homepage/pingle/Teaching/BADM%20791/Week%207%20Procrastination,%20Impatience%20and%20Hyperbolic%20Discounting/Rubenstein-Hyperbolic%20Discounting.pdf\"><span>empirically equivalent accuracy</span></a><span>. </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Fitness economics:</span><span> Evolutionary Psychology, Parental Investment, Epigenetics and Human Behavioral Genomics</span><span> These subfields and theories are not traditionally considered part of economic theory, so I'm lumping them all together under the umbrella of </span><span>fitness economics.</span><span> I consider these relevant as they provide an explanatory framework for the incentives that govern human behavior that is different from the heuristics and biases, the picoeconomics, and the homo economicus perspectives. Fitness economics provides a theory of the behavior of economic agents in terms not to the benefits to individuals themselves, but to the long term survival and propagation of the genes or some epigenetic elements that individuals carry. Frequently these explanations give a better understanding of why a particular bias or heuristic is ubiquitous in human cognition, and they are also utilized to generate hypotheses and empirical tests which are then carried on by behavioral economists, who evaluate heuristics and biases empirically. </span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>We suggest the creation of another subfield of economics: </span></p>\n<p><span>Moral Economics</span><span>. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>It could also be called </span><span>Altruistic Economics</span><span> if that seems more suitable down the road. The important intuition is that moral economics should be valuable for moral agents with many different perspectives, and even more so for altruistic agents and agents with broadly aggregative consequentialist values. </span></p>\n<h2 id=\"What_does_Moral_Economics_encompass__\"><span>What does </span><span>Moral Economics </span><span>encompass?</span><span> </span></h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span> </span>It can be taken as drawing a line in idea-space around the ideas in</span><span> </span><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/bk1/the_principle_of_altruistic_arbitrage/\"><span>Altruistic Arbitrage</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2014/11/15/certificates-of-impact/\"><span>Certificates of Impact</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/gvr/cognitive_load_and_effective_donation/\"><span>Cognitive Load and Effective Donation</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"/ea/jb/solving_donation_coordination_problems/\"><span>Coordination Problems for Donations</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/cc/help_a_canadian_give_with_a_taxdeduction_by/\"><span>Donation Swapping</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"/ea/fu/can_we_set_up_a_system_for_international_donation/\"><span>International Donation Trade</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"/ea/cx/gratipay_for_funding_eas/\"><span>Direct Funding for EAs</span></a><span> and especially </span><a href=\"http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/papers/moral-trade.pdf\"><span>Moral Trade</span></a><span>. </span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span>The idea is to create the concept of a field of knowledge which associates these in a cluster, and understand the mechanics and logic that makes them related in concept space, as well as provides a vocabulary and perspective which allows us to discover other ideas which belong to the same cluster.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><span><span> </span> </span>These ideas all use the methods of analysis that are traditionally associated with economics and game theory, but from a different perspective and under different assumptions about what matters for agents, what is valuable for them. It is also necessary to use different notions of externalities and of utility. Compared to traditional economic agents, we would \u00a0expect moral economic agents to behave differently, for there are qualitative shifts - even sign reversals - in the desirability of some forms of trade, formation of firms, incentives, contracts, coalitions and other economic precepts. </span></p>\n<p><span><span><span> </span></span>Moral economics would also diverge from traditional economics in having a multidimensional notion of value, which causes further detachment between price and market price, because different individuals will assign different subjective values for equal actions. Frequently they will value actions equivalently if taken by themselves or others, in a way that enables more frequent trade, in particular arbitrage, than the type of subjective valuation individuals have in standard microeconomics. </span></p>\n<p><span> Economics has traditionally \u00a0focused on positive predictions about states of affairs and passive evaluations about the desirability/efficiency of those states. Concerns about how to improve matters were generally passed off as being the responsibility of the state, which was assumed to be largely omniscient and benevolent. Though the latter assumption has been challenged by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice\">Public Choice Economics</a>, economics in general has had little to say about the perspective of an individual agent whose primary concern was aggregative value. Moral Economics hopes to address this deficiency.</span></p>\n<p><span><span><span> </span></span>The moral market is currently much less developed than the conventional economic market. The latter benefits from a sophisticated infrastructure to facilitate trade, including contracts, speculation and financial intermediaries, all of which are largely lacking from the Moral Economic sphere. As such, we should expect the moral market to be significantly less efficient than traditional market. This gap in market efficiency is expected to diminish as a larger fraction of resources reaches price equilibrium in both markets at the same time, effectively unifying them as a market, although I don't anticipate the gap to close anytime soon, or ever. </span><a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html\"><span>Bostrom</span></a><span> (2003), </span><a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\"><span>Scott Alexander</span></a><span>, Hanson (forthcoming), </span><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/06/what-got-us-here-wont-get-us-there/\"><span>Fabiano &amp; Caleiro</span></a><span> (2015), and </span><a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2014/05/14/machine-intelligence-and-capital-accumulation/\"><span>Christiano</span></a><span> (2014) make the case for us having reason to suspect that incentive structures will not lead to morally desirable outcomes in the very long run.

Science and technology are responsible for the largest changes in human and animal welfare, both for the better and for the worse; and science and technology are both a product of human intelligence. If AI technologies can match or exceed humans in intelligence, then human progress could be accelerated greatly \u2014 or cut short prematurely, if we use this new technology unwisely. MIRI's goal is to identify and contribute to technical work that can help us attain those upsides, while navigating the risks.</p>\n<p>We're currently scaling up our research efforts at MIRI and recruiting aggressively. We will soon be unable to hire more researchers and take on more projects unless we can secure more funding. In the interest of helping you make an informed decision about how you\u2019d like MIRI to develop, we're treating this fundraiser as an opportunity to explain why we're doing what we're doing, and what sorts of activities we could carry out at various funding levels. This post is a quick summary of those points, along with some of the reasons why I think donating to MIRI is currently a very highly leveraged way to do good.</p>\n<p>Below, I\u2019ll talk briefly about why we care about AI, why now is a critical moment for MIRI and the wider field, and what specific plans we could execute on with more funding.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why_care_about_artificial_intelligence_\"><span>Why care about artificial intelligence?</span></h2>\n<p>\"<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2013/06/19/what-is-intelligence-2/\">Intelligence</a>\"\u00a0(and therefore\u00a0\"<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2013/08/11/what-is-agi/\">artificial intelligence</a>\") is a vague notion, and difficult to pin down. Instead of trying, I\u2019ll just gesture at the human ability to acquire skills, invent science, and deliberate (as opposed to their ability to carry things, or their fine motor control) and say \"that sort of thing.\"</p>\n<p>The field of artificial intelligence aims to automate the many varied abilities we lump under the label \"intelligence.\" Because those abilities are what allow us to innovate scientifically, technologically, and socially, AI systems will eventually yield faster methods for curing disease, improving economies, and saving lives.</p>\n<p>If the field of AI continues to advance, <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/faq#imminent\">most top researchers in AI</a> expect that software will start to rival and surpass human intelligence across-the-board sometime this century. Yet relatively little work has gone into figuring out what technical insights we'll need in order to align smarter-than-human systems with our interests. If we continue to prioritize capabilities research to the exclusion of alignment research, there are a number of reasons to expect bad outcomes:</p>\n<p>1. In the absence of a mature understanding of AI alignment, misspecified goals are likely. The trouble is not that machines might \"<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2015/01/08/brooks-searle-agi-volition-timelines/#3\">turn evil</a>;\" the trouble is that computers do exactly what you program to. A sufficiently intelligent system built to execute plans that it predicts lead to the development of a cancer cure soon may well deduce that the most effective way to ensure that a cure is found is to kidnap humans for experiment, while resisting efforts to shut it down and creating backups of itself. This sort of problem could plague almost any sufficiently autonomous agent using sufficiently powerful search processes: programming machines to do what we <em>meant</em>\u00a0is a difficult task.</p>\n<p>2. Artificially intelligent systems could eventually become <a href=\"/intelligence.org/faq/#superintelligence\">significantly more intelligent</a> than humans, and use that intelligence to gain a <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2015/07/24/four-background-claims/#3\">technological or strategic advantage</a>. In this case, misaligned goals could be catastrophic. Imagine, for example, the cancer-curing system stripping the planet of resources to turn everything it can into computing substrate, which it uses to better understand protein dynamics.</p>\n<p>3.\u00a0The advent of superintelligent machines might come very quickly on the heels of human-level machine intelligence: AI funding could spike as human-level AI draws closer; or cascades of relevant insights may chain together; or sufficiently advanced AI systems might be used to advance AI research further, resulting in a feedback loop. Given that software reliability and AI system safety are probably not features that can be <a href=\"http://lukemuehlhauser.com/a-reply-to-wait-but-why-on-machine-superintelligence/#ending\">bolted on at the last minute</a>, this implies that by the time superintelligent machines look imminent, we may not have sufficient time to prepare.</p>\n<p>These claims and others are explored in more depth in Nick Bostrom's book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199678111/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\">Superintelligence</a></em>, and also on our new <a href=\"/intelligence.org/faq\">FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p>If we do successfully navigate these risks, then we could see extraordinary benefits: automating scientific and technological progress means fast-tracking solutions to humanity's largest problems. This combination of large risks and huge benefits makes the field of AI a very important lever for improving the welfare of sentient beings.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why_now_is_a_critical_moment_for_MIRI_and_the_field_of_AI\"><span>Why now is a critical moment for MIRI and the field of AI</span></h2>\n<p>2015 has been <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2015/07/16/an-astounding-year/\">an astounding year</a> for AI safety engineering.</p>\n<p>In January, the Future of Life Institute brought together the leading organizations studying long-term AI risk (MIRI, FHI, CSER) along with top AI researchers in academia (such as Stuart Russell, co-author of the leading AI textbook; Tom Dietterich, president of AAAI; and Francesca Rossi, president of IJCAI) and representatives from industry AI teams (Google DeepMind and Vicarious) for a\u00a0\"<a href=\"/futureoflife.org/AI/ai_conference\">Future of AI</a>\"\u00a0conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In the ensuing weeks and months, we've seen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a widely endorsed <a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/AI/open_letter\">open letter</a> based on conclusions from the Puerto Rico conference, including an accompanying <a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/static/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf\">research priorities document</a>\u00a0which draws heavily on MIRI's work.</li>\n<li>a grants program, funded by $10M from Elon Musk and $1.2M from the Open Philanthropy Project, aimed at jump-starting the field of long-term AI safety research.\u00a0(MIRI researchers received funding from <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2015/07/01/grants-fundraisers/\">four different grants</a>, two as primary investigator.)</li>\n<li>the announcement of the first-ever workshops and discussions about AI safety and ethics at the top AI and machine learning conferences, AAAI, IJCAI, and NIPS. (We presented a paper at the AAAI workshop, and we'll be at NIPS.)</li>\n<li>public statements by\u00a0<a href=\"http://lukemuehlhauser.com/musk-and-gates-on-superintelligence-and-fast-takeoff/\">Bill Gates</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.afr.com/technology/apple-cofounder-steve-wozniak-on-the-apple-watch-electric-cars-and-the-surpassing-of-humanity-20150323-1m3xxk\">Steve Wozniak</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2015/03/02/why-y-combinators-sam-altman-thinks-ai-needs-regulation/\">Sam Altman</a>, and others warning of the hazards of increasingly capable AI systems.</li>\n<li>a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWBBe13rAPU\">panel discussion on superintelligence at ITIF</a>, the leading U.S. science and technology think tank. (Stuart Russell and I spoke on the panel, among others.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is quite a shift for a public safety issue that was nearly invisible in most conversations about AI a year or two ago.</p>\n<p>However, discussion of this new concern is still preliminary. It\u2019s still possible that this new momentum will dissipate over the next few years, or be spent purely on short-term projects (such as making drones and driverless cars safer) without much concern for longer-term issues. Time is of the essence if we want to build on these early discussions and move toward a solid formal understanding of the challenges ahead \u2014 and MIRI is well-positioned to do so, especially if we start scaling up now and building more bridges into established academia. For these reasons, among others, my expectation is that donations to MIRI today will go\u00a0<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2015/07/20/why-now-matters/\">much further</a>\u00a0than donations several years down the line.</p>\n<p>MIRI is in an unusually good position to help jump-start research on AI alignment; we have a developed <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf\">research agenda</a> already in hand and years of experience thinking about the relevant technical and strategic issues, which gives us a unique opportunity to shape the research priorities and methodologies of this new paradigm in AI.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/technical-agenda/\">technical agenda papers</a> provide a good overview of MIRI's research focus. We consider the open problems we are working on to be of high direct value, and we also see working on these issues as useful for attracting more mathematicians and computer scientists to this general subject, and for grounding discussions of long-term AI risks and benefits in technical results rather than in intuition alone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"What_MIRI_could_do_with_more_funds\"><span>What MIRI could do with more funds</span></h2>\n<p>Over the past twelve months, MIRI's research team has had a busy schedule \u2014 we've been running workshops, attending conferences, visiting industry AI teams, collaborating with outside researchers, and recruiting. We've done all this while also producing novel research: last year, we published five papers at four conferences, and wrote two more which have been accepted for publication over the next few months. We've also produced around ten new <a href=\"/intelligence.org/all-publications\">technical reports</a>, and produced a host of new preliminary results that have been posted to our\u00a0<a href=\"/agentfoundations.org\">research forum</a>.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s what we've been able to do with a three-person research team. With a larger team, we could make progress much more rapidly: we'd be able to have each researcher spend larger blocks of time on uninterrupted research, we'd be able to run more workshops and engage with more interested mathematicians, and we'd be able to build many more collaborations with academia. However, our growth is limited by how much funding we have available. Our plans can scale up in very different ways depending on which of these funding targets we are able to hit:</p>\n<p>Target 1 \u2014 $250k: <strong><a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2015/07/18/targets-1-and-2-growing-miri#continuedgrowth\">Continued growth</a>.</strong>\u00a0At this level, we would have enough funds to maintain a twelve-month runway while continuing all current operations. We will also be able to scale the research team up by one to three additional researchers, on top of our three current researchers and two new researchers who are starting this summer. This would ensure that we have the funding to hire the most promising researchers who come out of our MIRI Summer Fellows Program and our ongoing summer workshop series.</p>\n<p>Target 2 \u2014 $500k: <strong><a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2015/07/18/targets-1-and-2-growing-miri#acceleratedgrowth\">Accelerated growth.</a></strong> At this funding level, we could grow our team more aggressively, while maintaining a twelve-month runway. We would have the funds to expand the research team to ten core researchers over the course of the year, while also taking on a number of exciting side-projects, such as hiring one or two type theorists. Recruiting specialists in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory\">type theory</a>, a field at the intersection of computer science and mathematics, would enable us to develop tools and code that we think are important for studying verification and reflection in artificial reasoners.</p>\n<p>Target 3 \u2014 $1.5M: <strong>Taking MIRI to the next level.</strong>\u00a0At this funding level, we would start reaching beyond the small but dedicated community of mathematicians and computer scientists who are already interested in MIRI's work. We'd hire a research steward to spend significant time recruiting top mathematicians from around the world, we'd make our job offerings more competitive, and we\u2019d focus on hiring highly qualified specialists in relevant areas of mathematics. This would allow us to grow the research team as fast as is sustainable, while maintaining a twelve-month runway.</p>\n<p>Target 4 \u2014 $3M: <strong>Bolstering our fundamentals.</strong>\u00a0At this level of funding, we'd start shoring up our basic operations. We'd spend resources and experiment to figure out how to build the most effective research team we can. We'd upgrade our equipment and online resources. We'd branch out into additional high-value projects outside the scope of our core research program, such as hosting specialized conferences and retreats and running programming tournaments to spread interest about certain open problems. At this level of funding we'd also start extending our runway, and prepare for sustained aggressive growth over the coming years.</p>\n<p>Target 5 \u2014 $6M: <strong>A new MIRI.</strong> At this point, MIRI would become a qualitatively different organization. With this level of funding, we would be able to begin building an entirely new AI alignment research team working in parallel to our current team. Our current technical agenda is not the only approach available, and we would be thrilled to spark a second research team approaching these problems from another angle.</p>\n<p>I'm excited to see what happens when we lay out the available possibilities (some of them quite ambitious) and let you all collectively decide how quickly we develop as an organization. We are not doing a matching fundraiser this year: large donors who would normally contribute matching funds are donating to the fundraiser proper.</p>\n<p>We have plans that extend beyond the $6M level: for more information, shoot me an email at\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:nate@intelligence.org\">nate@intelligence.org</a>.

Givewell has also <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/gwg/sens_and_givewell_conversation_between_holden/\">interviewed</a>\u00a0Aubrey de Grey of the SENS foundation. Owencb has previously <a href=\"/ea/c4/make_your_own_costeffectiveness_fermi_estimates/1rb\">estimated</a>\u00a0the cost-effectiveness of funding SENS/ anti-aging research as being around $50 per QALY. Aubrey de Grey has previously <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/04/living-to-1000-an-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/\">been averse to giving explicit cost-effectiveness estimates</a>\u00a0regarding how many QALYs would be gained per unit of funding supplied to SENS, though he has been clear that SENS's funding needs are \"<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/04/living-to-1000-an-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/\">$100 million per year for each of the next ten years</a>\".</p><br><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><br><p>This part of the post will consist of me using lots of best guesses to produce something vaguely resembling a cost-effectiveness estimate for SENS. You should <em>not</em> take this cost-effectiveness estimate literally.</p><p>If SENS needs one billion dollars to ensure that rejuvenation technologies that give individuals 30 extra years of healthy life are available to the public in 30 years, we might (completely arbitrarily<em>)</em> assume that someone else will come along and fund SENS in ten years if we don't contribute to funding SENS today. This means that if we fund SENS today instead waiting for it to be hypothetically funded in ten years from now,\u00a0about ten times the number of people who die each year would live 30 years of healthy life that they wouldn't have lived otherwise. Given that there are about 57 million deaths per year worldwide, this translates to about 17 billion YLLs lost by waiting ten years to fund SENS; since SENS ostensibly requires only 1 billion of philanthropic funding, this implies that $0.059 of funding for SENS\u00a0produces a YLL.</p><p>Of course, regenerative medicine won't be free to the people receiving it, and I have no idea how to account for this, given that I don't have a good idea of how much regenerative therapies will initially cost. The above estimate hasn't been adjusted to account for the fact that there is a time-delay between when funding is provided, and when the benefits of regenerative therapies are available to the public. Perhaps Aubrey <a href=\"http://acritch.com/credence-game/\">isn't well-calibrated</a>, and the \"$100 million per year for ten years\" figure is entirely wrong. It may be the case that starting work on SENS's research agenda earlier rather than later would allow certain people who would have otherwise died\u00a0to live until aging escape velocity is reached, which would have lots of utility. There are plenty of other issues with this cost-effectiveness estimate which I am sure that readers could point out.</p><p>The point I wanted to make, though, was that maybe, possibly, SENS is competitive with GiveWell's top charities-- I'm legitimately\u00a0not sure\u00a0whether I would fund SENS or GiveWell if I were making a charitable donation today.\u00a0Does anyone have any further thoughts on this topic?</p></div></div>"},

I can't technically recommend it since I haven't read it, but reviewers seem to think it's a bit better.)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/Superhuman-Habit-Becoming-Possible-Yourself/dp/1503295591/\">Superhuman by Habit</a> by popular self-improvement blogger Tynan. \u00a0This book lays out the best habit formation framework I have seen in print anywhere, along with a large collection of generally useful habits to consider forming.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/\">Thinking Fast and Slow</a> by Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman. \u00a0Awesome book packed with insights on how people think and how to do it better. \u00a0I was surprised that many of the ideas in this book were pretty new to me despite having been immersed in the rationality community for a long time, and even familiar ideas were presented in a way that helped me understand them on a deeper level.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/Charisma-Myth-Science-Personal-Magnetism/dp/1591845947/\">The Charisma Myth</a>\u00a0by Olivia Fox Cabane. \u00a0Excellent book on social effectiveness.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I\u2019d weakly recommend reading the books in the order I presented them.\u00a0 Books 1 and 2 will do a good job of clearing the proverbial self-improvement minefield and helping you avoid falling in to standard traps.\u00a0 (For example, before you read Don\u2019t Shoot the Dog you might be inclined to palm yourself in the face if you realize you\u2019ve forgotten to implement some life change you were trying to make.\u00a0 After reading the book, you\u2019ll realize that you should actually be reinforcing yourself for having remembered about the change\u2014remembering is the first step to doing.)\u00a0 The early sections of Book 3 will clear away even more traps, but the later parts will give you a bunch of ideas for actual concrete changes to make; I recommend you start experimenting with life changes at this point (if you haven\u2019t been inspired to already).\u00a0 Books 4 and 5 are \u201cbonus books\u201d on the topics of rationality and socializing respectively\u2026 given the foundation you\u2019ve built in the formation of habits and behavior change, you should be unusually well equipped to put the insights from these books in to practice in your life.\u00a0 If you\u2019re skeptical about this self-improvement stuff and five books seem like too much of an investment, I\u2019d read Book 3 only and see what changes you\u2019re able to implement based on it.</p>\n<p>I'd be curious if other EAs have more self-improvement book recommendations, especially if they meet the criteria I listed.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Romeo Stevens for convincing me to write this post and providing feedback on book recommendations.</em></p></div></div>"},

I describe the danger and propose a strategy for alleviating\u00a0it. (<a href=\"http://claviger.net/incentivizing-charity-cooperation.html\">Cross-posted from my blog.</a>)</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"Dangers_of_Breeding_Competition\">Dangers of Breeding Competition</h2>\n<p>I see two success scenarios for effective altruism, one focused more on causes and one more focused on charities: (1) the top effective interventions get sufficient funding, solve the problems they address, new interventions become most effective, and the cycle continues; and (2) top effective charities get funding from EAs and foundations, less effective charities are incentivized to care less about the donor and more about the beneficiary, and their managements gear their interventions toward higher cost-effectiveness. This post focuses on the second scenario.</p>\n<p>When I started getting involved with the running of a charity, with fundraising, and with organizing collaborative events, I didn\u2019t know anything about effective altruism (this was in 2010\u20132011). I already had my intuitions about cost-effectiveness and its drops at the margin in some cases, but by and large I saw most charities as cooperating toward the reduction of suffering. That allowed me to be happy about almost any charity fundraising success no matter whether we had anything to do with it.</p>\n<p>When I learned more about effective altruism, I realized how wasteful many charities are and how fundraising may do harm if it directs donations from more effective charities to less effective ones. Suddenly competition appeared where I thought only cooperation should rule.</p>\n<p>At our EA Berlin meetup, we are worried that we\u2019re not doing enough to address this problem. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0VrZPBskpg\">Melanie Joy</a>, who started the discussion, reported that some people involved in animal charities that ACE deems less effective than its top charities have come to view these top charities as competitors even though they work together toward closely related goals. However, some of these people are actually open to learning how to improve the effectiveness of their charities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Specialized_Effectiveness_Training\">Specialized Effectiveness Training</h2>\n<p>When I\u2019ve been thinking about improving the effectiveness of charities, I always thought along the lines of targeted advocacy, where I would try to find a charity that moves a lot of money and has much room for improvement, find someone in a key position who might be open to improving something, contract them and make a case for a more effective allocation of their resources. This is complicated and cumbersome. In this case, however, there are actually just these people who are in key positions and are open to educating themselves. This is an amazing new perspective!</p>\n<p>The problem is just that building up a highly effective charity in a specific cause area, running one or several specific interventions takes a lot of very specialized knowledge. The EA forum and the blogs of EAs and EA organizations are unlikely to hold the information that these people will need.</p>\n<p>Prioritization organizations could probably give some advice here, but they would become a central hub for this sort of consulting and are probably too resource-constrained to do that. They also need to be generalists, so they might not have the knowledge at quite the level these trainees require. Alternatively, someone could start an EA McKinsey, but I\u2019m not sure if that could work out financially. Consultants like Caroline Fiennes seem to focus more on advising donors than charities, but please let me know if there are already some that give quality advice to charities.</p>\n<p>Rather the top charities themselves could help here. It is in the interest of their transparency anyway to keep their strategies and processes open to the public, for example in blog posts, but they could go beyond that and actually accept in staff members of interested less effective charities and work with them for some time, maybe a month or a year.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Cost_Effectiveness_of_EA_Training\">Cost-Effectiveness of EA Training</h1>\n<p>The main question is whether such a program could be cost-effective for the top charity and in general, and I\u2019m not satisfied with the answer I can give to that.</p>\n<p>First, the costs to the top charity are not comparable with the expenses they would incur through volunteers, interns, or even average new hires. Typically you invest into hiring, onboarding, training, and salaries in the hope that the employee will stay long enough to far outearn this initial investment. In this case, however, the less effective charity would react to a call for applications from the top charity, and the latter only has to review the applications it receives, which already reduces costs. (The interest in such positions will likely increase as effective altruism becomes more popular.) Then, crucially, these are people who already worked in the same cause area for years. Even though their charities\u2019 performances might not be on par with the top charity yet, they are likely to be highly qualified in the same field. Training costs will be minimal. Finally, they may\u2019ve solved problems at their own charities that the top charity still struggles with, so that the flow of experience is not strictly one-sided. All in all, the cost for the program is likely to be smaller than it would at first seem.</p>\n<p>Second, these charities are cooperating toward a common goal, so the improvements of the less effective charities also count into the effectiveness side. The more money these charities move (and the lacking recommendation will unfortunately not have a crucial impact on that) and the greater their room for improvement, the greater will be the absolute improvement in impact that the program can achieve (and the more likely it is that they can afford to send an employee to such a training). If the program is very successful, the charities might even merge, which could enhance the effectiveness of both.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Incentivizing_EA_Training\">Incentivizing EA Training</h2>\n<p>It would be valuable to test these intuitions about the cost-effectiveness of such a program against real numbers that I currently don\u2019t have. It would also be interesting to poll how many organizations of what size would already be interested in taking part in such a program at any current top charity, but I would expect that number to increase over time.</p>\n<p>If the cost-effectiveness is sufficient, the program could be seen as increasing the effectiveness of the top charity via other charities, an additional argument for donating to them and for the prioritization organization to keep recommending them. That, in turn, would incentivize top charities to conduct such programs.</p>\n<p>All the while the program would also thwart division among charities by showing them that EA is not only about finding the best charities and donating to them at the exclusion of all others but also about lifting those other charities to the same level of effectiveness as the top charities where this is possible.</p></div></div>"},

So consider this a test-run.</em></p>\n<p>Nearly all of our actions (not just our giving patterns) are the product of our personal ratios. If someone gives me the choice between a dollar for me and two dollars for my sister, I have to determine whether my <em>M</em><em>e:Sister</em> ratio is greater or less than 2:1. If someone gives me the choice between a dollar for my sister and 100 dollars for a nameless child in Africa, I have to determine whether my\u00a0<em>S</em><em>ister</em>:<em>African Child</em> ratio is greater or less than 100:1. Etc.</p>\n<p>We discuss these personal ratios (if not quite in these terms) all the time, but I have seen less attention paid to national ratios.</p>\n<p>It is the official policy of the American government to value American lives over non-American lives. (Were it otherwise, the concept of a nation-state would be mostly meaningless.) But it is not the policy of the American government to place no value on non-American lives, as evidenced by, among other things, its concern (if minimal) for civilian casualties in foreign countries. Accordingly, the American government has what could be termed a <em>provincialism ratio</em> that guides (in a considered or unconsidered manner) its foreign and military policies.</p>\n<p>One example of this ratio in action is American drone strikes.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/mhpag/Desktop/provincialism%20ratio.docx#_ftn1\"><span><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></a> The trade-off when deciding whether to destroy a military target through the use of drones or ground troops is, in part, American soldiers\u2019 lives for non-American civilian lives. When a drone strike destroys a school full of children, many Americans look askance at their government\u2019s decision not to use ground troops. But of course, the other half of the decision is how many of the ground troops likely would have died in pursuit of the target.</p>\n<p>I expect\u2014indeed I hope\u2014that before deciding whether to use drones or soldiers, the military provides an estimate of (i) the number of civilians that would likely die through the use of drones; and (ii) the number of American soldiers that would likely die through the use of ground troops. In other words, the military provides the decision-maker with a ratio, and the decision-maker decides whether that ratio is acceptable.</p>\n<p>Although more difficult to determine, one could also calculate a provincialism ratio based on how much foreign aid America provides relative to those foreign programs' domestic counterparts. If the same amount of American tax dollars could save the life of one Washington DC resident or 1,000 individuals in southeast Asia, what would the American government do?\u00a0</p>\n<p>I believe this ratio goes to the heart of what it means to be American and, therefore, should be determined by the electorate. Although how that ratio is <em>translated </em>into foreign/military policy requires expertise, selecting the ratio does not. Indeed, we could create calculators that would roughly determine for individuals, based on their own behaviors, what their personal ratio is,\u00a0and then they could learn how that ratio might translate to foreign/military policy. I would like to see the 2016 presidential candidates on a spectrum based on their provincialism ratio: how does Hillary Clinton compare to Jeb Bush? I would like to see the candidates\u2014as well as coworkers, friends, and family\u2014openly debate this ratio.</p>\n<p>The very concept of a provincialism ratio will strike many as crass, and it is. But it exists, and perhaps by being forced to acknowledge that it exists, we will at least have a considered ratio and, overtime, one slightly less crass. \u00a0</p>\n<div>\n<hr>\n<!--[endif]-->\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/mhpag/Desktop/provincialism%20ratio.docx#_ftnref1\"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[1]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></a> This example is imperfect because most people would agree that\u2014holding national origin constant\u2014the death of an innocent civilian is more tragic than the death of a soldier. For this reason, the ratio animating drone-strike-related decisions likely overestimates the American government\u2019s value of non-American lives.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>"},

A new policy is proposed that will benefit 990 people by $1, but will cost the remaining ten people $10. The net benefit to society is $990 - 10*$10 = $880, a clear win, but these sorts of policies often don't happen. That's because the ten people who are harmed are strongly incentivised to work together to lobby the government against the policy. It's much harder for the 990 people to coordinate, and each individual stands to gain only $1.</p>\n<p>A typical example would be a corporation opposing regulation on pollution. If the regulation goes through, the shareholders of the corporation lose a lot, so will arrange a lobbying effort. The pollution causes a small harm to a much larger number of people, so is net harmful overall.</p>\n<p>However, it's possible today that social media and crowd funding could alleviate this problem. You could use a platform like kickstarter to get each of the 990 people to pay $0.1 to fund a lobbyist to represent their interests, overwhelming the funds of the narrow interest group.</p>\n<p>Lobbying in general seems to offer a lot of leverage. Typically only millions of dollars are spent on issues where amounts hundreds of times larger are at stake. And there have been academic studies finding the ROI on lobbying is high.</p>\n<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullock_paradox</p>\n<p>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-outsized-returns-from-lobbying/2011/10/10/gIQADSNEaL_blog.html</p>\n<p>http://www.nber.org/papers/w9064</p>\n<p>You could test this idea by running a couple of small campaigns on the side.</p>\n<p>Any suggestions to add?

MIRI's Robbie Bensinger is to be thanked for this. They are available as a 'pay as you want' download from <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/\">MIRI's website</a>.</p>\n<p>Eliezer's preface begins as follows:</p>\n<p>\"You hold in your hands a compilation of two years of daily blog posts. In retrospect, I look back on that project and see a large number of things I did completely wrong. I\u2019m fine with that. Looking back and not seeing a huge number of things I did wrong would mean that neither my writing nor my understanding had improved since 2009. Oops is the sound we make when we improve our beliefs and strategies; so to look back at a time and not see anything you did wrong means that you haven\u2019t learned anything or changed your mind since then...\"</p>\n<p>Robbie gives his own description:</p>\n<p>\"Stylistically, the essays in this book run the gamut from \u201clively textbook\u201d to \u201ccompendium of thoughtful vignettes\u201d to \u201criotous manifesto,\u201d and the content is correspondingly varied. Rationality: From AI to Zombies collects hundreds of Yudkowsky\u2019s blog posts into twenty-six \u201csequences,\u201d chapter-like series of thematically linked posts. The sequences in turn are grouped into six books, covering the following topics:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n</p><ul>\n<li>Book 1\u2014Map and Territory. What is a belief, and what makes some beliefs work better than others? These four sequences explain the Bayesian notions of rationality, belief, and evidence. A running theme: the things we call \u201cexplanations\u201d or \u201ctheories\u201d may not always function like maps for navigating the world. As a result, we risk mixing up our mental maps with the other objects in our toolbox.</li>\n<li>Book 2\u2014How to Actually Change Your Mind. This truth thing seems pretty handy. Why, then, do we keep jumping to conclusions, digging our heels in, and recapitulating the same mistakes? Why are we so bad at acquiring accurate beliefs, and how can we do better? These seven sequences discuss motivated reasoning and confirmation bias, with a special focus on hard-to-spot species of self-deception and the trap of \u201cusing arguments as soldiers.\u201d</li>\n<li>Book 3\u2014The Machine in the Ghost. Why haven\u2019t we evolved to be more rational? Even taking into account resource constraints, it seems like we could be getting a lot more epistemic bang for our evidential buck. To get a realistic picture of how and why our minds execute their biological functions, we need to crack open the hood and see how evolution works, and how our brains work, with more precision. These three sequences illustrate how even philosophers and scientists can be led astray when they rely on intuitive, non-technical evolutionary or psychological accounts. By locating our minds within a larger space of goal-directed systems, we can identify some of the peculiarities of human reasoning and appreciate how such systems can \u201close their purpose.\u201d</li>\n<li>Book 4\u2014Mere Reality. What kind of world do we live in? What is our place in that world? Building on the previous sequences\u2019 examples of how evolutionary and cognitive models work, these six sequences explore the nature of mind and the character of physical law. In addition to applying and generalizing past lessons on scientific mysteries and parsimony, these essays raise new questions about the role science should play in individual rationality.</li>\n<li>Book 5\u2014Mere Goodness. What makes something valuable\u2014morally, or aesthetically, or prudentially? These three sequences ask how we can justify, revise, and naturalize our values and desires. The aim will be to find a way to understand our goals without compromising our efforts to actually achieve them. Here the biggest challenge is knowing when to trust your messy, complicated case-by-case impulses about what\u2019s right and wrong, and when to replace them with simple exceptionless principles.</li>\n<li>Book 6\u2014Becoming Stronger. How can individuals and communities put all this into practice? These three sequences begin with an autobiographical account of Yudkowsky\u2019s own biggest philosophical blunders, with advice on how he thinks others might do better. The book closes with recommendations for developing evidence-based applied rationality curricula, and for forming groups and institutions to support interested students, educators, researchers, and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's obviously a lot there but I have found it quite influential, and Eliezer is the leading proponent of a very compelling style of philosophy from which one could imagine launching an entire school of philosophical thought. Already, these materials have been very influential, and with this book's release, I think a lot of people will be prompted to do some rereading.</p></div></div>"},

In our final, most finely tuned run,  Stochastic Gradient Descent achieved an F1 score of 93%, about two  percentage points more than the best of the other three classifiers.</p>\n<p>The clearest takeaways from the grid search over a plausible <span>SGD</span> parameter set were that as loss functions <code>log</code>, <code>hinge</code>, <code>modified_huber</code>, and <code>perceptron</code> performed well; that as penalty <code>l2</code> and <code>elasticnet</code> performed well; that activating the shuffling helped; that using  bigrams in addition to unigrams was useful but that 3-grams did not  improve the F1 score; and that the best values for <code>alpha</code> and <code>n_iter</code> varied widely among the best configurations.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been almost a year since I implemented this, so please don\u2019t quiz me on the details.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_Daemon\">The Daemon</h2>\n<p>The daemon is the service that continuously runs on the server and continually checks the source feeds. It sends <code>if-modified-since</code> and <code>if-none-matches</code> headers whenever possible to minimize server load and traffic. Then the  feed entries are compared to those in the database to filter out known  ones, whereby we also compute the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index\">Jaccard distance</a> between the preprocessed titles to avoid posting the same press releases over and\u00a0over.</p>\n<p>The articles that are typically associated with these entries are  then fetched, stripped of boilerplate using Readability, summarized  using Sumy, and finally posted to Tumblr. We extended the extraction  step with one that also extracts a featured image and added a naive  keyword extraction for the post tags on\u00a0Tumblr.</p></div></div>"},

One proposed solution for the lack of global cooperation is increasing our cooperativeness with the use of enhancement technologies. One proposed solution for the value preservation problem would be placing permanent constraints on these contingent multi-level evolutionary forces necessary for the continuity of human values; <a title=\"Nick Bostrom's Singleton paper\" href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/singleton.html\"> placing such constraints would also require a strong global cooperative structure.\u00a0</a></p>\n<p>We will gather a list of possible paths towards massive global cooperation and discuss how all of them fail; thereby drawing attention to the obstacles to achieving such state. By massive global cooperation we mean one where there are no strong sub-groups aggressively competing between themselves or with the global group. Arguably, this level of cooperation would both (1) drastically decrease risks that arise due to our inability for large-scale cooperation (e.g. the Ultimate Harm), and (2) would guarantee our values are preserved even if evolutionary unfit. We will leave aside the question of whether this solution is required and whether there are other solutions for these problems.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Group_condensation\">Group condensation</strong></p>\n<p>Smaller groups tend to form semi-spontaneously inside a larger scale group, becoming stronger over time and compromising the larger co-operational structure. For instance, suppose we ban most forms of in-group favouritism and existing sub-groups, but allow monogamy to continue as a dominating mating strategy. Over time, in-group favouritism condensates over the nuclear family, and it gradually spreads across society. This process is partially how some classical civilizations were born. The nuclear family is the solid particle that, over time, condensates the volitile cooperation structure into forming sub-groups.</p>\n<p>But suppose that, using some moral biochemical manipulation or whatever, we make it so that the prior probability of any individual cooperating with any other is the same. Even then, stochastic variations allow reciprocal binary relationships to evolve, and asset specificity and the like will naturally develop. Regardless of the prior probability, other individuals will find more efficient to cooperate within the dyad due to reciprocity and asset specificity. Sub-groups emerge all over again. To avoid the formation of sub-groups, it seems there has to be active altruistic punishment for in-group favouritism. Any instance of it seems to form a nuclei over which progressively larger and stronger groups will condensate; in the same way atmospheric vapour will condensate into cloulds in the presence of micro water droplets. If massive global cooperation is the result we ought to pursue, then the formation of tight-knit, fraternal, norm-oriented, cooperative and efficient groups could be seen as, in this context, a form organized crime, i.e., systematized and coordinated cheating inside a larger cooperative structure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now suppose we ban long-term reciprocity altogether. Nonetheless, if we let leadership skills vary, then naturally individuals will outsource decisions to one another, and this will let groups condensate around natural managers. Therefore, we would have to abolish leadership inequality \u2013 and servantship inequality for analogous reasons. It seems that if we were to mirror an ant-colony we would have to be as socially featherbrained as they are. No long-term reciprocity, no long-term mating, no asset specificity, no leadership, no servantship and so on. On the extreme, this would be the abolishment of individual agents, we would have turned into one single superorganism. But then doom-prevention is starting to look more like doom than it should. This solution ultimately fails because it produces the very scenario massive global cooperation was intended to avoid.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Altruism_requires_bloodshed_\">Altruism requires bloodshed </strong></p>\n<p>In our path towards increasing human cooperation we might dismiss the fact altruism needs some form of aggression to survive. Eliminating in-group favouritism (parochialism) has to be done thoroughly, because groups without it have no out-group aggression, no defence mechanism and thus become vulnerable. Groups with parochial altruists will always have an advantage over groups with tolerant altruists, thus any remaining group with parochial altruists can immediately take over. No matter how cooperative a group is, if there is no level of parochialism whatsoever, then there will be no incentive to protect the group against aggressors from other smaller groups that do contain parochial altruists. When a tolerant altruistic group encounters a parochial altruistic group, it loses every time, no matter how powerful. This fact is the reason cooperation without aggressiveness never evolved in the first place.</p>\n<p>Another path \u2013 in line with an alternative explanation for the emergence of altruism \u2013 would be to allow strong altruistic punishment irrespective of group membership. In order to counterbalance the parochial-altruists\u2019 danger mentioned above, there would have to be egalitarian measures. There will be no in-group favouritism, but non-parochial altruists would get less punishment <em>iff</em> there is already a high probability outgroups-parochial-altruists will punish them. Call this strong egalitarian altruistic punishment.</p>\n<p>Here is a failure mode for both these paths. Even though there is no credible account of the evolution of altruism where it becomes stable without any form of aggression, an increasingly cooperative and altruistic society will see aggression as a primitive monstrosity. Aggression gets less and less frequent, and the idea of evoking any of the paths above seems abhorrent to this evolved cooperative society. Refusing to take the available options, altruists go extinct for their extremism.</p>\n<p>Solution. Strong reputational positive feedback with egalitarian corrections. There is no punishment for cheaters or out-groups, but altruists are rewarded and non-parochial altruists with a high probability of being punished by outgroups-parochial-altruists are rewarded more. However, this is all very complex and abstract as far as massive global cooperation proposals go. It might as well be that these affirmative justice measures infer too many costs on non-parochial altruists. It would be as if the UK and US gave extra resources to France during WWII instead of directly fighting the Nazis. No idea if it would have worked. We suspect it would have failed from the start because it is unconvincing. If we wish to look for simpler, already evolved solutions, then of the two hypothesized evolutionary pressures for cooperation, i.e. aggression towards out-groups and aggression towards cheaters, the latter seems the most compatible with massive global cooperation.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Systemic_risks\">Systemic risks</strong></p>\n<p>Some obstacles arise not in the path towards massive global cooperation but in creating an end-result that is too vulnerable to systematic risks brought by increasedrisk correlation and dependency across society. Increased global cooperation means increased risk correlation on a global scale, increasing the likelihood of existential catastrophe. Our current clusters of increased relative correlation (nations, etc.) protect us from existential threats. There are few systemic risks that would take out all nations together, but if we become only one nation we will lose variability. Moreover, if all individuals within nations become unspecific, we become the bleak repetition of a single immune system variant. Whatever kills one individual will be likely to kill all of them. Whatever threatens any group will threaten all groups.</p>\n<p>Solution. Each individual could be packed with an emergency survival strategy. Just like or reptilian brain kicks in when we sense danger, our in-group favouritism and specificity would kick in when we sense existential catastrophe. Like an ant colony that produces more queens every time it senses danger. Society would become some metamorphic superorganism with local fluctuations that would rapidly turn into divergent groups when existential risk increases, only to merge again whenever the risk lowers.</p>\n<p>Problem. This strategy looks more like science fiction than with a massive global cooperation solution. Perhaps it should be a conditional. Whenever we increase individual specificity or dilute groups into a single humanity, we should also assure that we preserve the ability to differentiate again when needed.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>None of the presented solutions is satisfactory. If we currently have reasons to believe massive global cooperation is required, then we should find more feasible and secure ways of producing it.</p></div></div>"},

Given the current growth of the EA movement, it may be quite impressive to have worked at an EA organization when they were still small. The work itself can be impressive as well: You\u2019ll often have high levels of autonomy and perhaps even </span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/07/what-people-miss-about-career-capital-exceptional-achievements/\"><span>exceptional achievements</span></a><span>.

This also applies to the network and career capital you get, since these too depend on your skill at the job. Additionally, the positions can usually only be filled with EAs to make sure there\u2019s a fit with the team, which makes you less replaceable. The replaceability argument also cuts both ways: If you earning to give for an organization instead of working for them, they will employ some EA who could otherwise do other useful things with their time.

For the risks, it was based on expected damage, amount of work that has been done so far, and a functional form for marginal impact. I did it from several perspectives, including conventional economic (with discounting future human utility), positive utilitarian (maximizing net utility and not discounting), and biodiversity. Note that the pure negative utilitarian of reducing aggregate suffering may prefer human extinction (I don't subscribe to this viewpoint). I believe that the future will generally be net beneficial.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course there has been a lot of talk recently that if one values future generations not negligibly, reducing global catastrophic risk is of overwhelming importance. But I have not seen the point that even if you do discount future generations exponentially, there could still be an overwhelming number of discounted consciousnesses if you give a non-negligible probability of computer consciousnesses this century. This is reasonable because an efficient computer consciousness would use much less energy than a typical human. Furthermore, it would not take very long to construct a traditional Dyson sphere, which is independent satellites orbiting the sun that absorb most of the sun's output. The satellites would be ~micron thick solar cells plus CPUs, and would require a small fraction of the matter in the solar system. Note that this means that even if one thinks that artificial general intelligence will be friendly, it is still of overwhelming importance to reduce the risk of not reaching the computer consciousnesses, which could just mean global catastrophic risk and technological civilization not <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/08/13/the-long-term-significance-of-reducing-global-catastrophic-risks/\">recovering</a>.\u00a0I am open to arguments about far future trajectory changes other than global catastrophic risks, but I think they need to be developed further. This also includes potential mass animal suffering associated with galactic colonization or simulation of worlds.</p>\n<p>Looking across these global catastrophic risks, I find the most promising are artificial intelligence alignment, molecular manufacturing, high-energy physics experiments, 100% kill engineered pandemic, global totalitarianism, and alternate foods as solutions to global agricultural disruption. Some of these are familiar, so I will focus on the less familiar ones.</p>\n<p>Though many regard high-energy physics experiments as safe, a risk of one in ~1 billion per year of turning the earth into a strangelet or black hole or destroying the entire visible universe is still very bad. And the risk could be higher because of <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/4527972/Probing_the_Improbable_Methodological_Challenges_for_Risks_with_Low_Probabilities_and_High_Stakes\">model error</a>. The net benefit excluding the risk of these experiments considering all the costs I believe is quite low, so I personally think they should be banned.</p>\n<p>Local totalitarianism like in North Korea eventually gets outcompeted. However, global totalitarianism would have no competition, and could last indefinitely. This would be bad for the people living under it, but it could also stifle future potential like galaxy colonization and artificial general intelligence. I am less familiar with the interventions to prevent this.</p>\n<p>Global agricultural disruption could occur from risks like nuclear winter, asteroid/comet impact, super volcanic eruption, abrupt climate change, or agroterrorism. Though many of these risks have been studied significantly, there is a new class of interventions called alternate foods that do not rely on the sun (disclosure: I came up with them as catastrophic solutions). Examples include growing mushrooms on dead trees and growing edible bacteria on <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/viewerng/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxkYXZpZGRlbmtlbmJlcmdlcnxneDo1MTg1ZDQ4NGI1MDMxN2Q0\">natural gas</a>. I have done some modeling of the cost effectiveness of alternate food interventions, including planning, research, and development. This will hopefully be published soon, and it indicates that expected lives in the present generation can be saved at significantly lower cost than typical global poverty interventions. Furthermore, alternate foods would reduce the chance of civilization collapse, and therefore the chance that civilization does not recover.</p>\n<p>There was earlier discussion on what might constitute a fifth area within effective altruism of effective environmentalism. I would propose that this would not be regulating pollution to save lives in developed countries at $5 million apiece. However, there are frameworks that value biodiversity highly. One could argue that we will eventually be able to reconstruct extinct species or put organisms in zoos to prevent extinction. But the safer route is to keep the species alive in the wild. In an agricultural catastrophe, not only would many species go extinct without human intervention, but desperate humans would actively eat many species to extinction. Therefore, I have estimated that the most cost-effective way of saving species is furthering alternate foods.</p>\n<p>Overall, there are several promising causes, but I think the most promising is alternate foods. This is because it is competitive with other global catastrophic risk causes, but it has the further benefit of being more cost-effective at saving lives in the present generation than global poverty interventions, and more cost-effective at saving species than conventional interventions like buying rainforest land. I am working on a mechanism to allow people to support this cause.</p>\n<p>Edit: <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13753-016-0097-2\">here </a>is the cost per life saved paper now that it is published.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},

There are three positions to be filled, one of which is for EAF\u2019s sister-organization, </span><a href=\"http://foundational-research.org/\"><span>Foundational Research Institute</span></a><span> (FRI). If you are particularly talented or a great fit for EAF, you should apply even if you don\u2019t fit any profile. The most urgent positions are:</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>A person for operations, finance and running the organization. The tasks depend on the skillset and interests of the person, e.g. a person with a particular interest in REG could do mostly operations for REG. Who they look for:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Strong interest in EA.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Demonstrated ability to run things, e.g. a chapter, organization or volunteer project.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Speaking German</span><span> is a big advantage though you may be hired if you\u2019re committed to learn the language.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Programming, IT and Excel skills would be highly advantageous.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>A Director of Growth to scale REG. The position could be part-time or full-time. Would work very long hours during poker tournaments. Who they look for:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Good networker, <span>good people skills / social skills</span>. </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Interest or experience in poker.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Experience in project management, marketing and/or similar fields.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>You can demonstrate the necessary social skills in many ways, including in a personal conversation with EAF.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>A researcher for the Foundational Research Institute. Would do research into topics such as AI trajectories, technological forecasting and all things far-future-related with the aim of reducing future suffering. Working hours are flexible, ideally full-time. Preferably would work from Switzerland, but could also work from home. Who they look for:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Very strong analytical/quantitative skills and a strong interest in the subject.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>One way to demonstrate your fit is by publicizing your thoughts on some related topic, e.g. on a personal blog.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Approach </span><a href=\"http://foundational-research.org/contact-us/\"><span>Brian Tomasik or Lukas Gloor</span></a><span> for more information. They should be able to determine your fit.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<h3 id=\"What_s_the_interview_process_like_\"><span>What\u2019s the interview process like?</span></h3>\n<p><span>Historically, most employees have previously volunteered for EAF (or GBS), though this is a small sample. An application form can be found on the \u2018</span><a href=\"http://gbs-switzerland.org/support/work-with-us/\"><span>Work with us</span></a><span>\u2019-page.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>How to get involved on a lower-commitment basis</span></p>\n<p><span>EAF is very open to having volunteers. This is also a great chance to demonstrate your skills and see if there\u2019s a fit for a full-time engagement. Often paperwork and operational tasks are done by EAF\u2019s leaders because it\u2019s hard to find reliable volunteers who can work independently. If you can do this, that\u2019s a big plus. </span></p>\n<p><span>To become a volunteer, get in touch with a team member of EAF (if in doubt, ask </span><a href=\"mailto:jonas.vollmer@gmail.com\"><span>Jonas Vollmer</span></a><span>) to determine how you can best contribute.</span></p>\n<p><span>It\u2019s especially important that you don\u2019t just stop after just a few months. The longer and the more hours the more useful the work usually becomes.</span></p>\n<p><span>Don\u2019t know how you want to contribute? Be persistent and get info on EAF\u2019s work from team members. Ideas will come up. Potential volunteers are encouraged to not be shy about asking questions.</span></p>\n<p><span>Potential volunteer tasks:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>It can be useful if you\u2019re motivated enough to do low-status tasks such as paper work and are reliable at doing this.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Video or image editing. If you\u2019re committed to do this longer-term it may even be worth teaching yourself these skills.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Don\u2019t forget to ask how else you could contribute! How you can best contribute is best determined in person.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"How_competitive_are_the_positions_\"><span>How competitive are the positions?</span></h3>\n<p><span>The applicant pool for any position is usually not big and most applicants have historically been previously known to the team. EAF could find suitable volunteer tasks for ~50% of enthusiastic interested EAs (on the current margin).</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"Why_work_at_Effective_Altruism_Foundation_\"><span>Why work at Effective Altruism Foundation?</span></h3>\n<p><span>EAF is a team of young and highly skilled people with diverse backgrounds and a very strong altruistic motivation. You would be working on challenging and meaningful projects in an exceptionally honest and friendly atmosphere. There is large potential in establishing the EA movement in German-speaking areas and EAF is making considerable progress.</span></p>\n<div><span><br></span></div></div></div>"},

Its chief claim is that all else being equal we should prefer work earlier and prefer to work on risks that might come early. This is because we are uncertain about when we will have to face different risks, because we expect diminishing returns of extra work, and because we expect that more people will work on these risks in the future.</p>\n<p>I explore this claim both qualitatively and with explicit models. I consider its implications for two questions: first, \u201cWhen is it best to do different kinds of work?\u201d; second, \u201cWhich risks should we focus on?\u201d.</p>\n<p>As a major application, I look at the case of risk from artificial intelligence. The best strategies for reducing this risk depend on when the risk is coming. I argue that we may be underinvesting in scenarios where AI comes soon even though these scenarios are relatively unlikely, because we will not have time later to address them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can read the full report here:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Allocating-risk-mitigation.pdf\">Allocating risk mitigation across time</a>.</p></div></div>"},

See, </span><span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-everyone-even-our-readers-should-save-enough-to-live-for-6-24-months/\">for instance, this 80000 Hours post</a></span><span>. However, since it's often claimed (though not definitively proven/no consensus) that there's a significant \"haste consideration\" in donating now instead of later, the opportunity costs of holding large amounts of liquid money on hand is nontrivial. One possible solution is \"a community insurance scheme\", outlined in the bottom of the article above. However, this \"scheme has a serious challenge \u2013 who decides whether someone really deserved the insurance payout, and who is freeloading \u2013 but is potentially much more efficient.\"</span></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><span>I think we can improve on this.</span></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><span><strong>Proposed Solution</strong></span></div>\n<div><span><strong><br></strong></span></div>\n<div><span>I propose the following: </span><span><strong><span>Specific donations are insured in a one-directional, two-party contract.\u00a0</span></strong></span></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><span>Here's how it works: Person A is debating how much of her $18,000 to donate to the Against Malaria Foundation. She originally wants to save $9,000 in the bank (enough to last her around 6 months). Hearing this, Person B suggest that A only saves 4000 dollars in the bank, B is willing to insure donations to the AMF up to 6,000 for 12 months. B specifies a list of conditions that he's willing to insure A for (including termination of employment, voluntary or otherwise, significant physical or personal illness, death in a family, etc), wherein he'll give A $6,000 back within 30 days of any of the triggers happening. A agrees, and both the agreement and A's donation is publicly logged online.</span></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><span>If none of the conditions trigger in the next 12 months, then Person B managed to help Person A help the AMF without any cost to himself! Yay!\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><span>If any of those conditions trigger in the next 12 months, A can choose to either i)not get insurance because she doesn't need it, or, ii)as is more likely the case, she will contact B (whether/what forms of proof are necessary depends on A/B's relationship with each other). B actually only has $4000 in savings, but he gets paid $3,000 after taxes/personal consumption per month. B waits until he gets paid, and then he gives A $6000, leaving 1,000 in the bank. A is glad to have the insurance. B still needs to tough out 1 month with low savings, but the statistical odds of both A and B being in financial trouble is far lower than A alone.\u00a0\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><span>One Caveat: The same donation cannot be insured by two different parties, to prevent potential abuse.\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><span>Also, If A insures B, B should not insure A within the same time period.\u00a0</span></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><span><strong>Benefits\u00a0</strong></span></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Almost certain to have greater total donations (at least among EAs). </span><span>Donation insurers have an easy way to increase donations on expectation</span></li>\n<li><span>Helps with community.</span></li>\n<li><span>People can feel safer and are thus more likely to take risks.</span></li>\n<li><span>People who donate a lot wouldn't be SOL or be forced to rely on the generosity of family, banks or friends.\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><span><strong>Potential Risks</strong></span></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Abuse : Risk of traditional abuse/moral hazard substantially lower than a traditional community insurance scheme (because you aren't actually gaining any additional money, you're just getting your donation money back).\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span>Counterparty Risks: It's possible that B insures A, but B also took a hit to his financial position. However, B can insure his donations too. The fact that these insurance policies are always 2-party and single-dimensional reduces this greatly.</span></li>\n<li><span>Naive EV utilitarians may take advantage of this to claim donation insurance for superficial problems just so they can donate more...hopefully we don't have so many dicks in the movement though.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span>Obviously if you believe in a \"dishaste consideration\", you should not promote easier ways to donate now as opposed to later. <br></span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p><span><span><br></span></span></p></div></div>"},

{"date": "12th Aug 2015", "title": "Moral Economics in Practice: Musing on Acausal Payments through Donations", "author": "Peter_Hurford", "num_comments": "5 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>I haven't been following <a href=\"/ea/m2/moral_economics_what_why_whom_how_when_what_for/\">the moral economics posts</a> that closely, but I wanted to add a musing of my own. \u00a0This isn't important to read. \u00a0Summary: You can effectively pay an EA without giving them anything by donating on their behalf. \u00a0This transfer has economic properties that tingle my brain when I think about them.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Think when someone gives you a birthday present. \u00a0Sometimes you like it and it has value to you. \u00a0Great! \u00a0Sometimes you don't like it and it doesn't have that much value. \u00a0Bummer!</p>\n<p>The birthday present cost a certain amount of money for the buyer to purchase and it's worth a certain amount to you. \u00a0Often times, the present is worth less to you than the buyer spent to purchase it, or you would have gotten it yourself. \u00a0This is why <a href=\"https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/104699/original/christmas.pdf\">economists often bemoan the loss of value inherent in gift giving</a>. \u00a0(Of course, this is just one type of value, and there are many non-monetary benefits to gift giving that economists might not pay much attention to!)</p>\n<p>Perfect gift giving (from an economics perspective) is when you get a present where the amount of money it cost the person to buy the present is equal to (or less than) the value you get from the present.</p>\n<p>One such example of perfect giving is if the present-giver could have also given you cash equal to the present's value and you could have bought a present you liked better yourself. \u00a0Indeed, this is the entire idea behind gift cards -- provide more value to the person by letting them buy what they want, but not lose the social institution of gift giving by making it just a straight cash transaction. \u00a0(Though many aunts and uncles often give a card with cash inside.)</p>\n<p>However, one could also imagine a perfect gift-giver that always gives you a gift that you would have purchased on your own (except you haven't yet). \u00a0Since you would have definitely spent the money yourself, this gift is basically as good as cash. \u00a0For example, while a gift card to Arby's isn't of much value to me (<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3s/why_eat_less_meat/\">I'm a vegetarian</a> but I do like their mozzarella sticks), given the amount I spend on Amazon, a gift card to Amazon is basically as good as cash.</p>\n<p>The point is here that I can pay someone without paying them money, provided I give them something that is as good as money. \u00a0For EAs who <a href=\"/givingwhatwecan.org\">donate a substantial portion of their income to charity</a>, this gets a bit more interesting. \u00a0Since they would donate a certain amount of money to a certain charity, I can then pay them using this principle by (a) donating to their chosen charity myself and (b) communicating that amount to the person so they can reduce their intended donation by that amount.</p>\n<p>This is cool because the money transferred is <em>acausal</em> -- it never is sent to them, yet it ends up paying them an amount. \u00a0This means you can transfer them money at any time, without their permission, without needing much coordination, without needing to set up a way to make payments between each other, in any country where a donation can be made, regardless of what country they are in. \u00a0It's also a power only really available to EAs. \u00a0...And that's kinda cool to think about.</p></div></div>"},

In a recent conversation between the two of us, I mentioned to Owen that I didn't have a good way to estimate the probability that joining the AI safety research community would actually avert existential catastrophe. Though it would be hard to be certain about this probability, it would be nice to have a principled back-of-the-envelope method for approximating it. Owen actually has a rough method based on the one he used in his article <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Allocating-risk-mitigation.pdf\">Allocating risk mitigation across time</a>, but he never spelled it out.</p>\n<p>We thought that this would be best presented interactively; since the EA Forum doesn't allow JavaScript in posts, we put the tool on the Global Priorities Project website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/08/quantifyingaisafety/\"><strong>You can use the tool here to make your own estimate!</strong></a></p>\n<p>(Assuming that you've gone to the site and made your own estimate...)</p>\n<p>So, what does this mean? Obviously this is quite a crude method, and some of the variables you have to estimate are themselves quite tricky to get a handle on, but we think they\u2019re more approachable than trying to estimate the whole thing directly, and expect the answer to be within a few orders of magnitude of correct.</p>\n<p>How big does the number have to be to imply that a career in AI safety research is one of the best things to do? One natural answer is to multiply out by the number of lives we expect we could get in the future. I think this is understandable, and worth doing as a check to see if the whole thing is dominated by focusing on the present, but it\u2019s not the end of the story. There are fewer than 10 billion people alive today, and collectively it seems like we may have a large amount of influence over the future. Therefore if your estimate for the likelihood of a career in AI safety looks much worse than a 1 in 10 billion chance, it seems likely that there are other more promising ways to productively use your share of that influence. These might eventually help by influencing AI safety in another way, or through a totally different mechanism. The method we\u2019ve used here could also be modified to estimate the value of joining communities working on other existential risks, or perhaps other interventions that change the eventual size or productivity of the AI research community, for example through outreach, funding, or <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/the-timing-of-labour-aimed-at-reducing-existential-risk/\">field-steering work</a>.</p></div></div>"},

I compare cause areas and attempt a quantitative comparison between <span>LLIN</span> distributions and advocacy for farmed animals. In short, I will continue to fundraise for malaria prevention but personally donate more to prioritization research in the area of animal\u00a0advocacy. (<a href=\"http://claviger.net/my-cause-selection-denis-drescher.html\">Cross-posted from my blog.</a>)</p>\n<p>Since my selection of the cause area is highly dependent on the interventions and the implementing charities available in that cause area, this article will cover the complete stack of cause, intervention, and charity selection, which I will call <span>CIC</span> for short. I will also distinguish between CICs to fundraise for and such that I want to donate to directly since fundraising also requires that the <span>CIC</span> is marketable in my target\u00a0demographic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Preselection\">Preselection</h2>\n<p>Since I\u2019m constrained in time, feel well value-aligned with our prioritization organizations, and don\u2019t want to duplicate effort, I\u2019m relying on GiveWell and Animal Charity Evaluators for a preselection. I\u2019m looking forward to relying on Open Phil similarly, once the project publishes concrete recommendations. I\u2019m also taking meta charities into account but struggle with the absence of the same\u00a0preselection.</p>\n<p>Thus my cause selection is down to NTDs (two charities), malaria, poverty, farmed animals (three charities), and various areas of <span>EA</span> meta\u00a0activism.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Subselections\">Subselections</h2>\n<p>The cause areas fall into the category of those that affect mostly nonhuman animals, those that affect mostly humans, and the\u00a0metacharities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Nonhuman_Animals\">Nonhuman\u00a0Animals</h3>\n<p>The Animal Charity Evaluators top charities all look great, and I have no hard and fast ideas for how to weigh them against each other. <span>ACE</span>\u2019s very rough quantitative estimates are almost within the same order of magnitude, so I don\u2019t expect the significant effort I\u2019d have to invest to prioritize between them to be warranted. Some ideas I\u2019ve had that might help if I wanted to do it after all\u00a0were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The amount of meat consumption in the country the charity is active in, particularly of smaller animals like poultry and fish, based on the assumption that the marginal benefit of my investment may be lower in a country that is largely vegetarian already\u00a0(India?).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The rate of adoption of veg*nism in the country, based on the assumption that a higher rate may indicate that anticarnistic campaigns can gain good\u00a0traction.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I also thought about taking the consumer price index into account, thinking that the charity can do more with my money there, but the differences between the countries that the three charities are active in were\u00a0negligible.</p>\n<p>Please note that <span>ACE</span> may have already done or may be working on such\u00a0research.</p>\n<p>What <span>ACE</span> is doing reminds me a lot of what Open Phil is doing in terms of how hard it is for them to quantify the impact of the charities. This doesn\u2019t seem to be so much in the nature of the cause areas \u2013 as with prioritizing research or existential risk \u2013 but rather the result of the neglect of the area, so that <span>ACE</span> has only little and poor-quality prior research to draw\u00a0on.</p>\n<p>Imma once warned that neglectedness may be overexerted as proxy for marginal cost-effectiveness in areas where the latter is too hard to determine, but once again I see no other option. Hence <span>ACE</span> is also one of my\u00a0candidates.</p>\n<p>In the end Animal Equality, in addition to <span>ACE</span>, is ahead in terms of charities to donate to for the silly reasons that they are tax-exempt in Germany and have the highest quantitative estimate of the top charities, but I think I\u2019ll rather make an unrestricted donation to <span>ACE</span>, which it can regrant if it\u2019s somehow suddenly flooded with\u00a0donations.</p>\n<p>Mercy For Animals is ahead in terms of charities <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bronies-for-Animals/948292625230086\">to fundraise for</a>, because they have a fundraiser system on their\u00a0website.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Humans\">Humans</h3>\n<p>GiveDirectly is brilliant as certainty and scalability go, but those are important for very risk-averse donors and major foundations respectively. So long as I \u201conly\u201d have to allocate a few ten thousand euros, the cost-effectiveness is more important to me, and that is lower compared to the other top\u00a0charities.</p>\n<p>Evidence Action and <span>SCI</span> are top contenders, but I think the evidentiary basis for the effectiveness of deworming, while sizable, is more ambiguous than that for bednets, and more extreme estimates are also more likely to be wrong. So for as long as LLINs remain highly effective, I\u2019ll rather invest\u00a0in:</p>\n<p>The Against Malaria Foundation. It seems to combine the advantages of having a solid evidentiary basis, being highly effective, and being well-run as an organization. Since it has a fundraiser system and is tax-exempt in a whole bunch of countries, it\u2019s particularly good <a href=\"http://yoursiblings.org/projects/against-malaria-foundation/details\">for fundraising for</a>. I also hope to dedicate my master\u2019s thesis to the topic of <span>LLIN</span> distributions \u2013 once I get any useful feedback on my proposal from my\u00a0assessors.</p>\n<p>GiveWell seems relatively less neglected than <span>ACE</span>, but that comparison doesn\u2019t fit neatly into this\u00a0section.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll look into the standout charities in more detail once I either have more time or some of them have become top\u00a0charities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Metacharities\">Metacharities</h3>\n<p>I\u2019d love to invest in metacharities, but absent prioritization between them, I don\u2019t know to which. I\u2019m hoping that my <a href=\"http://claviger.net/expected-utility-auctions.html\">expected utility auctions</a> will alleviate that problem a little by crowdsourcing prioritization to some degree, but they\u2019re still a thing of the\u00a0future.</p>\n<p>Some metacharities have estimated some leverage ratios, but they were always (as far as I\u2019ve seen) the average ones of their past donations not of marginal donations, which may bias the estimate upward. (Except when the metacharity was just fundraising for operating expenses like Giving What We Can.) In some cases they didn\u2019t take future impact into account either, which may bias the estimate downward if the metacharity had or has a lot of initial costs and is still increasingly gaining traction with its program. I\u2019d much rather like to see a rough estimate what difference in scale my marginal donation can make a few years down the line and with what elasticity (say, $100,000 might achieve a lot, but $50,000 a lot less than half of that, because it would not be enough for a certain\u00a0investment).</p>\n<p>A focus on current leverage ratios may incentivize metachrities to defer important investments into the future, scaling up slower than they could, and thus deferring some of the alleviation of suffering that they could do into the future, allowing more dolors to accrue in\u00a0total.</p>\n<p>My intuition is that even investing in a random one of the <span>EA</span> meta charities I\u2019ve looked at would be at least as good as an investment in a GiveWell top charity, so it would be fallacious to ignore the cause area just because I can\u2019t decide between several great options, so outside small windows for investment like the <span>GWWC</span> fundraiser, this has been another reason for me to plan to invest in <span>ACE</span> in the\u00a0future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"My_Species_Vs__Your_Species\">My Species Vs. Your\u00a0Species</h2>\n<p>And then I have to somehow decide between humans and nonhuman animals. That\u2019s really a bit unfair since I\u2019m pitting one species against a whole lot of species, but at this point it seems much easier to help farmed animals than wild animals, which reduces the number of species a\u00a0lot.</p>\n<p>I attempt an estimation to compare the average <span>ACE</span> top charity to <span>AMF</span> in terms of the years of suffering that a donation averts. I\u2019m lumping all <span>ACE</span> top charities together because I can\u2019t meaningfully prioritize between them. I put the results in bold type in case you\u2019re in a\u00a0hurry.</p>\n<p>The concept of the value of a life has been elusive to me, and when people try to estimate it by considering what impairments of health people accept for what increase in wage, the resulting estimates vary widely. The same surveys can\u2019t be conducted among farmed animals, further complicating the picture. The multipliers that I assign intuitively vary widely, and I have trouble justifying them in ways that wouldn\u2019t be speciesist. Hence I don\u2019t want to rely on them for my prioritization and rather base it on well-being over\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>For clarification: Valuing well-being may in my case mean something along the lines of negative-leaning utilitarianism, though <a href=\"http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/ideas/negative-utilitarianism/\">that can\u2019t be the whole picture</a>, and I perceive suffering as something that can be borne to some degree before it becomes increasingly unbearable, so that occasional dusts specks are perfectly bearable and don\u2019t register for most people but torture is probably unbearable for most. I perceive whatever does the bearing like a muscle that can fatigue, recover from fatigue, and can possibly be trained (some sort of reverse hedonic adaptation). Proper philosophers have probably debated this view at length already, so I\u2019d happily link any such debates if you know where to find\u00a0them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"LLIN_Distributions\"><span>LLIN</span>\u00a0Distributions</h3>\n<p>GiveWell uses for its quantitative estimate of the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/Interventions/Nets/GiveWell%20cost-effectiveness%20analysis%20of%20LLIN%20distribution%202014.xls\">cost-effectiveness of <span>LLIN</span> distributions</a> the complete cost of the distribution including costs that <span>AMF</span> can leverage from partners such as Concern Universal or <span>IMA</span>. That is important to avoid <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/16/leverage-in-charity/\">lots of confusion</a> about the attribution of impact. When I enter the <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/DollarsPerNet.aspx\">historical average cost per net</a> for <span>AMF</span> ($3.64) instead of the composite cost, the spreadsheet shows an average cost between $25 per undiscounted <span>DALY</span> averted and $64 per 3%-discounted <span>DALY</span> averted with uniform age weights. At the original composite costs, it returns cost between $44 and $111. <strong>Hence you can avert 9\u201340 DALYs per\u00a0$1000.</strong></p>\n<p>However, GiveWell\u2019s estimates only include lives saved. With 198 million cases of malaria in 2013 and 584,000 fatal ones, the nonfatal ones outnumber the fatal ones 339:1, so that the monetary and health benefits from the prevented nonfatal cases may be sizable. Plus I may value some degree of reduction of suffering over a year higher than the creation of another life year that is barely worth\u00a0living.</p>\n<p>If the <span>YLL</span>-to-<span>YLD</span> ratio is similar in the regions that <span>AMF</span> targets for their high malaria incidence and low insecticide resistance, then you avert one case of malaria for $6\u201310 (the costs per life saved for the two different net costs divided by 339). The <a href=\"http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/who-severe-malaria-tmih-supplement-2014.pdf\"><span>WHO</span></a> estimates that 2 million of the 198 million cases of malaria annually were severe cases, which have a <a href=\"http://www.malariajournal.com/content/13/1/363/table/T1\">disability weight</a> of 0.21 as opposed to 0.005 of uncomplicated malaria. With a donation of $1000, you can thus avert another 100\u2013166 cases of malaria or 0.7\u20131.2 <span>DALY</span>. This hardly changes the result above, but an estimate of the <span>YLD</span> averted due to saved treatment costs and prevented loss of income would be\u00a0interesting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Animal_Advocacy\">Animal\u00a0Advocacy</h3>\n<p>Animal Charity Evaluator confirmed that the estimates for all interventions that comprise the quantitative estimates of their top charities rely on the same assumptions about the number of animals not eaten, market elasticity, and recidivism. Hence I adjusted the donation in the <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/interventions/online-ads/online-ads-calculator/\">Online Ad Impact Calculator</a> so that the resulting number of animals saved came close to the <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/foundational-research/impact-donations/\">top charity average</a> of about 4769. The result was a reduction of 1700 years of suffering for $1000. These are not yet disability\u00a0adjusted.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/comments-on-compassion-by-the-pound/\">Bailey Norwood</a> and <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods/\">Brian Tomasik</a> have discussed quantitative estimates of farmed-animal suffering. I don\u2019t have access to Norwood\u2019s Compassion, By the Pound, and Tomasik writes that Norwood assigned a positive value of life to chickens farmed for meat, which he contests most convincingly on the basis of their short lives and brutal deaths (<a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.blogspot.de/2009/07/ham-and-eggonomics-part-2.html?showComment=1248671192226#c5437917887275157401\">Norwood\u2019s response</a>), but Will MacAskill writes in Doing Good Better that Norwood\u2019s \u201caverage rating for broiler chickens is -1\u201d anyway. (Cows, farmed for meat and milk, account for only 30 of the 1700\u00a0years.)</p>\n<p>I created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11E3rXP4m7Rj8Gk8_OX-7qvNGQQgKYBDIKTPl3AUCGHA/edit#gid=0\">a copy of the spreadsheet</a> and undid the merging of cows farmed for meat and dairy and that of chickens farmed for meat and eggs, and introduced a new section to the spreadsheet to multiply in Norwood\u2019s disability weights, which I divided by ten to put them in the same range as DALYs or QALYs. I\u2019m not sure what to call this unit, but let\u2019s say <strong>a donation of $1000 to the average <span>ACE</span> top charity averts between -36 and -2210 \u201cQALYs,\u201d with the best estimate at -283\u00a0\u201cQALYs.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>These units may be incorrect and only comparable to a limited degree. The estimate doesn\u2019t include wild-caught fish, whether caught intentionally or accidentally. Neither does it include environmental or health benefits, or flow-through effects of reduced recidivism through increased social acceptance or of increased visibility of\u00a0veganism.</p>\n<p>Finally, I don\u2019t know whether it would be speciesist to value a human <span>QALY</span> one or two orders of magnitude higher than a nonhuman \u201c<span>QALY</span>,\u201d and would be tempted to just split my low-volatility budget between the CICs, but since I find it much harder to rally people in support for nonhuman animals than other humans, I want to invest as much of the money that is at my sole discretion where I can\u2019t invest <a href=\"http://claviger.net/august-2015-outreach-and-fundraising.html\">fundraised money</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Future_Trends\">Future\u00a0Trends</h2>\n<p>Over the course of the past year I\u2019ve become less risk averse in my selection, probably through the realization that we\u2019re already diversifying our investment portfolio by having different opinions on what the most cost-effective interventions are and prioritizing neglected ones in the hopes of earning a higher marginal utility. Hence I don\u2019t need to worry so much about the risk attached to my own investment and can rather aim for something closer to the highest expected value. This trend may well continue, particularly once Open Phil releases\u00a0recommendations.</p></div></div>"},

You need lots of risk to get very high payoffs, but since donors won't directly benefit from those payoffs, they tend to play it very safe, the same way that bureaucrats do. The problem is, playing it safe lops off the long tail of very good outcomes. Paul Graham explains the general principle (http://paulgraham.com/hiring.html):</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Risk and reward [in wealth investing] are always proportionate. For example, stocks are riskier than bonds, and over time always have greater returns. So why does anyone invest in bonds? The catch is that phrase \"over time.\" Stocks will generate greater returns over thirty years, but they might lose value from year to year. So what you should invest in depends on how soon you need the money. If you're young, you should take the riskiest investments you can find.</em></p>\n<p><em>All this talk about investing may seem very theoretical. Most undergrads probably have more debts than assets. They may feel they have nothing to invest. But that's not true: they have their time to invest, and the same rule about risk applies there. Your early twenties are exactly the time to take insane career risks.</em></p>\n<p><em>The reason risk is always proportionate to reward is that market forces make it so. People will pay extra for stability. So if you choose stability-- by buying bonds, or by going to work for a big company-- it's going to cost you.\"\"</em></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Clearly as a society we should do a combination of:</p>\n<p>i) scaling things with well-understood payoffs;</p>\n<p>ii) trying things with uncertain returns, but where at least either the benefit or likelihood of success can be roughly estimated;</p>\n<p>iii) trying new things with uncertain returns where the benefit and likelihood of success are very hard to estimate.</p>\n<p>There will be some outstanding opportunities in all of these categories - which approach this community should be disproportionately focussed on depends on which one is <em>relatively neglected</em> by the rest of society.</p>\n<p>So, is the rest of the world overall risk-loving, risk-neutral or risk-averse when it comes to their (intentional and accidental) social impact?</p>\n<p>Or to put it another way, are we being left mostly neglected safe opportunities, or mostly neglected high-risk/high-leverage opportunities?</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/976019725787718/\"><strong>Post 2</strong></a></p>\n<p>Is 'highly skeptical EA' a self-undermining position? Here's my line of thought:</p>\n<p>* 'Highly skeptical EAs' think you should demand strong empirical evidence before believing that something works / is true / will happen.</p>\n<p>* As a result they typically think we should work on scaling up 'proven' interventions, as opposed to doing 'speculative/unproven' things which can't be demonstrated to a high standard of evidence to be better.</p>\n<p>* But the claim that it's higher expected value to do the best 'proven' thing rather than a speculative/unproven thing that on its face looks important, neglected and tractable, is itself unproven to a high standard of evidence. Indeed, it's a very hard claim to substantiate and would require a very large project involving lots of people over a long period of time investigating the average long-term return on, e.g. basic science research. As a result I think we don't really know at the moment and should be pretty agnostic on this question.</p>\n<p>* So if we need strong evidence to accept positions, should we in fact believe with confidence that we really need strong evidence to think something has a high expected social impact?</p>\n<p>Philosophers may note the similarity to logical positivism undermining its own core claim, though in this case it's more probabilistic than a matter of contradictory formal logic.</p>\n<p>The fact that an idea partially undermines itself isn't a decisive argument against it, but it does suggest we should tread with care.</p></div></div>"},

I was offered to either be a software engineer or a data scientist, and I chose to become a data scientist, because I thought the career was more intrinsically interesting and data science seems to me to be more likely to have some staying power if it turns out we\u2019re in another tech bubble (which seems quite plausible to me).</p>\n<p>I was excited by this transition because while I felt like I had worked a lot with statistics in college, I didn\u2019t know a lot about how it worked in the real world, where the statistical models would be under a lot of demand. I learned a lot about \u201cdata engineering\u201d, which is the work of moving data around and building data pipelines that can work under heavy load. I spent much more of my job doing that, and actually haven\u2019t learned much data science yet.</p>\n<p>While I feel like I learned a lot about R in my last review (July-Sep \u201814), I definitely didn\u2019t know as much about it as I did now. I feel pretty confident now in both R and Ruby, and can now look back on some of the code I wrote July-Sep \u201814 and laugh at how much of a beginner I once was. I think I got my first tastes of \u201cadvanced\u201d R scripting in Oct-Dec \u201814, which culminated in writing the plugin <a href=\"https://github.com/peterhurford/batchman\"><span>Batchman</span></a> for batching processes in R. I\u2019m excited to learn more!</p>\n<p>I also got my first taste of \u201cbig data\u201d, where the amount of data I was working with was too big for R to handle all at once. This is new for me, and also pretty new for our start-up. There are definitely more mainstream tools to be used here (e.g., Hadoop), but I took the approach of trying to build some tools for R to work with big data instead.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I took the chance to work on some different skills and picked up more responsibilities by becoming a part-part-time project manager for our team. Most of the teams here have their own full-time project managers, but data science was too domain heavy to make it easy to recruit one. I volunteered to fill that gap. So I\u2019ve been applying organizational skills to make sure our team is on-track.</p>\n<p><br> Overall, I really like my co-workers, I feel like I\u2019m learning a lot, I feel like my work is high challenge while still being possible, and I really like our work\u2019s flexible schedule to allow me to work on EA projects when I want to.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve also been excited by the salary afforded to me by this job, which has allowed me to make some donations, noted in my <a href=\"http://peterhurford.com/other/donations.html\"><span>donation log</span></a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Day_Job__What_Went_Wrong\">Day Job: What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>I do feel bad about the 25.5hrs a week figure.</p>\n<p>I can defend it, of course. First, I\u2019m using an actual timer to determine how much time I actually work, and I\u2019m not counting going out for lunch or even going to the bathroom. If you took a typical 40hr/wk person and subtracted out their Reddit time and bathroom time and lunch hours, I\u2019m sure they would be much lower than 40 hours.</p>\n<p>Second, there was an awful lot of holidays in November and December, and I took two weeks off.</p>\n<p>Third, I feel like data science, and anything with software really, is truly a \u201cwork smarter, not harder\u201d kind of industry where the benefits of your results frequently are not a result of how many hours you spent working on them.</p>\n<p>And fourth, maybe the utilitarian in me should be glad that I\u2019m getting the same salary, but am able to put more hours into EA projects?</p>\n<p>But all that being said, I think it would be beneficial to me personally if I spent more work on my job, because I think I would learn more in response.

I\u2019ve been ramping up my involvement with them lately, so the small hours per week isn\u2019t really indicative of more recent trends. I\u2019ll wait for the official Charity Science three month review to explain our success in more detail, but we\u2019ve definitely moved over $100K in 2014 to GiveWell\u2019s top charities.</p>\n<p><strong>My personal Birthday for Charity fundraiser</strong> -- I raised over $5K for AMF!

The biggest success here is learning delegation, by delegating a lot to Jason and to MFA -- things they would do better than I would! I also managed to delegate some other veg research, such as <a href=\"https://impactresearch.hackpad.com/HumaneSpot-Research-Summary-U8B1Ti0WZTl\">a look into Humane Spot</a>\u00a0and a study on disguising the intent of vegetarian questionnaires (forthcoming).</p>\n<p><strong>I worked with Tom to <a href=\"https://github.com/tricycle/eaforum/pull/1\">add a feature to this EA forum</a></strong>, the \"More Comments\" link underneith comments in the sidebar. \u00a0If you saw how complex the EA Forum codebase is, you'd be impressed too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"EA_Direct__What_Went_Wrong\">EA Direct: What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Survey Data Analysis</strong> -- This has been a lesson in the planning fallacy.

I was wrong -- I spent nearly 60hrs on it to finish, way more than I expected it would take, but the diligence was important. But then before I could get the final touches done, I hit Thanksgiving, my birthday fundraiser, Christmas, and then New Years, and had no time to get it out the door. It\u2019s still sitting there. I\u2019m disappointed to not have this done by this review, but I\u2019ll definitely have it done by the next one.</p>\n<p><strong>Chicago Skeptics Meetup </strong>-- The Chicago Skeptics have two meetups a month. I went to one in September and promised I\u2019d be back to the next one. I never returned\u2026 to that meetup, or any of the ones over the next four months.

September saw the launch of 64or32.com, which has about $6 in recurring monthly revenue (from ads), and which I\u2019d value at about $100.

It\u2019s pretty new -- a goal I started in December. I\u2019m mainly doing this because it\u2019s fun, though I think there are benefits to learning it. It seems like a generally good skill to have.</p>\n<p><strong>Programming</strong> -- I spent some time outside of work honing my programming skills. I wrote<a href=\"https://github.com/peterhurford/git-it-on.zsh\"><span>Git it on</span></a>, a neat plugin for quickly navigating GitHub from the command line. I wrote <a href=\"https://github.com/peterhurford/git-aliases.zsh\"><span>Git-aliases</span></a>, which is a compilation of aliases for interacting with GitHub more quickly. I also wrote some more R plugins, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/peterhurford/summarizeR\"><span>SummarizeR</span></a>, which generates summary reports of data, and <a href=\"https://github.com/peterhurford/surveytools\"><span>Surveytools</span></a>, a modern, lightweight workflow for analyzing survey data. I\u2019d love to work on these more and get them up on <a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/\">CRAN</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"/news.ycombinator.com\">Hacker News</a>\u00a0(goals for the next review).</p>\n<p><strong>Exercise</strong> -- I\u2019m disappointed that I\u2019m not taking exercise seriously enough, given the large effect it has on happiness, productivity, and well-being (all three things I like). I didn\u2019t exercise much Jul-Sep \u201814, and I wanted to turn that around for Oct-Dec \u201814. I succeeded in exercising more (0.4hrs/wk -&gt; 1.4hrs/wk), even buying a pull-up bar, but I\u2019m still not where I\u2019d like to be. My exercising is still inconsistent, and my weight at 31 Dec 2014 was heavier than it was at 1 Jan 2014. I think as much as I don\u2019t like the idea, I need to pony up the money and go to an actual gym and lift actual weights, and double my time spent exercising per week. \u00a0(Update 3 Jan - going to try to stick to <a href=\"http://peterhurford.tumblr.com/post/107049329111/my-2015-exercise-plan-i-might-be-able-to-stick-to\">this exercise plan</a>.)</p>\n<p><strong>Social</strong> -- I like to socialize with people. This number is high because I had about 20 days (&gt;20% of the review period) where I was on vacation, because our civilization decided to smush the year\u2019s three most important holidays together into a block of 36 days. I expect this number to go down for the next review period.</p>\n<p><strong>Sleep and Break</strong> -- These numbers are about as good as they\u2019re going to get, and attempting to decrease them further will only be counterproductive. Everyone needs time to recharge. Eight hours of sleep and two hours of break each day still leaves thirteen hours a day to do important stuff, and I certainly have not optimized that yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Prep</strong> -- I\u2019m glad that living closer to work has finally brought this number down to something I feel is manageable.</p>\n<p><strong>Planning</strong> -- I spent significantly more time planning Oct-Dec \u201814 than I did in Jul-Sep \u201814. I don\u2019t know why that is.</p>\n<p><strong>Email</strong> -- I\u2019m spending more time on my email now. I think this is because I do get more email, but I think it\u2019s more that I\u2019m spending more concentrated periods of time doing emails and multitask less while handling email, so I\u2019m more likely to tag time as \u201cEmail\u201d.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleaning</strong> -- I\u2019m spending a lot more time cleaning my room now in Oct-Dec \u201814 than Jul-Sep \u201814. It doesn\u2019t feel that way, though. I wonder why that is? I imagine that maybe my Jul-Sep \u201814 number wasn\u2019t very accurate?</p>\n<p><strong>Moving</strong> -- I\u2019m delighted that after spending a ton of time moving in June and September, I finally have a review period where I spent no time moving!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I find it very hard to make resolutions for the entire year -- I just don\u2019t know enough about what my life will be like to plan that far. I much rather like making goals for the next three months instead -- it\u2019s long enough to be a serious commitment, but short enough to allow you to pivot.</p>\n<p>I believe that while Oct-Dec \u201814 didn\u2019t bring me as many accomplishments as I hope to have, it did set up a lot in the background that will make Jan-Mar \u201815 unusually productive. I\u2019m excited to work more on Charity Science and I\u2019m excited to get some entrepreneurship projects off the ground and hopefully start earning some money from places other than my job.</p>\n<p>However, while I\u2019m reflecting, I must note that I talk a lot a lot about wanting to do more things, but I don\u2019t talk enough about what I\u2019m going to cut out to make that happen. I\u2019ve long run out of the delusion that I can just make more time for everything, but I don\u2019t always act on it.</p>\n<p>Ideally, I think my week should have five more hours spent on my day job, five more hours spent on Charity Science, five more hours spent on Entrepreneurship projects, and 30 more minutes spent on learning Chinese.

{"date": "3rd Mar 2015", "title": "Maximizing long-term impact", "author": "Squark", "num_comments": "14 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><strong>Outline:</strong>\u00a0I argue that interventions which affect the relative probabilities of humanity's long-term scenarios have much higher impact than all other interventions. I discuss some possible long-term scenarios and give a high-level classification of interventions.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Background\">Background</h1>\n<p>It is common knowledge in the Effective Altruism movement that different interventions often have vastly different <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility\">marginal utility</a>\u00a0(per dollar or per some other unit of invested effort). Therefore, one of the most important challenges in maximizing impact is identifying interventions with marginal utility as high as possible. In the current post, I attack this challenge in the broadest possible scope: taking into account impact along the entire timeline of the future.</p>\n<p>One of the first questions that arise in this problem is the relative importance of short-term versus long-term impact. A detailed analysis of this question is outside the scope of the current post. I have argued <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lo7/anatomy_of_multiversal_utility_functions_tegmark/\">elsewhere</a> that <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/34639481/Updateless_Decision_Theory.pdf\">updateless decision theory</a> and Tegmark's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis\">mathematical universe hypothesis</a> imply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference\">time discount</a> falling much slower than exponentially and only slightly faster than [time since Big Bang]<sup>-1</sup>. This means that the timescale on which time discount becomes significant (at least about 14 billion years from today's standpoint) is much larger than the age of the human species, favoring interventions focused on the far long-term.</p>\n<p>The most evident factor affecting humanity's welfare in the long-term is scientific and technological progress. Progress has drastically transformed human society, increased life expectancy, life quality and total human population. The industrial revolution in particular has created a world in which the majority of people in developed countries enjoy a lifestyle of incredible bounty and luxury compared to the centuries which came before. Progress continues to advance in enormous steps, with total eradication of disease and death and full automation of labor required for a comfortable lifestyle being realistic prospects for the coming centuries.</p>\n<p>It might appear reasonable to conclude that the focus of long-term interventions has to be advancing progress as fast as possible. Such a conclusion would be warranted if progress was entirely 1-dimensional or at least possessing only one possible asymptotic trajectory in the far future. However, this is almost certainly not the case. Instead, there is a number of conceivable asymptotic trajectories (henceforth called \"future scenarios\") with vastly different utility. Hence, interventions aiming to speed up progress appear much less valuable than interventions aiming to modify the relative probabilities of different scenarios. For example, it is very difficult to imagine even a lifetime of effort by the most suitably skilled person speeding up progress by more than 100 years. On the other hand it is conceivable that a comparable effort can lead to changing scenario probabilities by 1%. The value of the former intervention can be roughly quantified as 10<sup>2</sup> late-humanity-years whereas the value of the latter intervention is at least of the order of magnitude of (14 billion x 1% = 1.4 x 10<sup>8</sup>) late-humanity-years.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Future_Scenarios\">Future Scenarios</h1>\n<p>A precise description of scenario space is probably impossible at the current level of knowledge. Indeed, improving our understanding of this space is one type of intervention I will discuss in the following. In this post I don't even pretend to give a full classification of scenarios that are possible as far as we can know today. Instead, I only list the examples that currently seem to me to be the most important in order to give some idea of how scenario space might look like.</p>\n<p>Some of the scenarios I discuss cannot coexist as real physical possibilities since they rely on mutually contradictory assumptions on the feasibility of artificially creating and/or manipulating intelligence. Nevertheless, they all seem to be valid possibilities given our current state of knowledge the way I see it (other people have higher confidence than myself regarding the aforementioned assumptions). Also, there seems to be no set of reasonable assumptions under which only scenario is physically possible.</p>\n<p>I call \"dystopia\" those scenarios in which I'm not sure I would want to wake up from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryonics\">cryonic suspension</a>\u00a0and \"utopia\" the other scenarios (the future is likely to be so different from the present that it will appear to be either horrible or amazing in comparison). This distinction is not of fundamental importance: instead, our decisions should be guided by the relative value of different scenarios. Also, some scenarios contain residual free parameters (scenario space <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moduli_(physics)\">moduli</a>, so to speak) which affect their relative value with respect to other scenarios.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Dystopian_Scenarios\">Dystopian Scenarios</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Total_Extinction\">Total Extinction</h3>\n<p>No intelligent entities remain which are descendant from humanity in any sense. Possible causes include <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust\">global thermonuclear war</a>, bioengineered pandemic, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo\">uncontrollable nanotechnology</a>\u00a0and natural disasters such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event\">asteroid impact</a>. The last cause, however, seems unlikely since frequency of such events is low and defenses will probably be ready long before time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Unfriendly_Artificial_Intelligence\">Unfriendly Artificial Intelligence</h3>\n<p>According to a hypothesis known as \"AI foom\",\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_self-improvement\">self-improving artificial intelligence</a> will reach a critical point in its development (somewhere below human intelligence) at which its intelligence growth will become so rapid that it quickly crosses into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence\">superintelligence</a> and becomes smarter than all other coexisting intelligent entities put together. The fate of the future will thus hinge on the goal system programmed into this \"singleton\". If the goal system was not designed with safety in mind (a highly non-trivial challenge known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence\">friendly AI</a>), the resulting AI is likely to <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/files/AIPosNegFactor.pdf\">wipe out the human race</a>. The AI itself is likely to proceed with colonizing the universe, creating a future possibly more valuable than inanimate nature but still highly dystopian<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Superdictatorship\">Superdictatorship</h3>\n<p>A single person or a small group of people gains absolute power over the rest of humanity and proceeds to abuse this power. This may come about in a number of ways, for example:\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dictators enhance their own intelligence. The risks of this process may lead to extremely immoral\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism\">posthumans</a>\u00a0even if the initial persons were moral.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Creation of superintelligences that are completely loyal to the dictators. These superintelligences can be AI or enhanced humans. This scenario requires the malevolent group to solve the \"friendliness\" problem (maintaining a stable goal system through a process of extreme intelligence growth).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Use of nanotechnology to forcibly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading\">upload</a> the rest of humanity into a computer simulation where they are at the mercy of the dictators.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Some sort of technology for complete mind control, e.g. involving genetically reprogramming humanity using a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus\">retrovirus</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The risk of these scenarios is elevated by concentration of resources and technological capacity in the hands of authoritarian governments.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Unhumanity\"><span>Unhumanity</span></h3>\n<p>A large number of people undergo a sequence of mind modifications that make them more intelligent and economically competitive but lose important human qualities (e.g. love, compassion, curiosity, humor). The gradual nature of the process creates an <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/ase/schelling_fences_on_slippery_slopes/\">unalarming appearance</a>\u00a0since the participants consider only the next step at any given moment instead of considering the ultimate result. The resulting posthumans use their superior intelligence and economic power to wipe out the remaining unmodified or weakly modified people. The value of this scenario can be as low as the <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Unfriendly_artificial_intelligence\">UFAI</a> scenario or somewhat higher, depending on the specifics of the mind modifications.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Utopian_Scenarios\">Utopian Scenarios</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Friendly_Artificial_Intelligence\">Friendly Artificial Intelligence</h3>\n<p>The AI foom singleton is imbued with a goal system very close to human values, possibly along the lines of <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/CEV.pdf\">Coherent Extrapolated Volition</a> or the values of the specific person or group of persons from whose point of view we examine the desirability of scenarios. This is probably the most utopian scenario since it involves an immensely powerful superintelligence working towards creating the best universe possible. It is difficult to know the details of the resulting future (although there have been some <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence/\">speculations</a>) but it is guaranteed to be highly valuable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Emulation_Republic\">Emulation Republic</h3>\n<p>All people exist as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading\">whole brain emulations</a>\u00a0or modified versions thereof. Each star system has a single government based on some form of popular sovereignty.</p>\n<p>Non-consensual physical violence doesn't exist since it is impossible to invade someone's virtual space without her permission and shared virtual spaces follow guaranteed rules of interaction. A fully automated infrastructure in which everyone are shareholders allows living comfortably without the necessity of labor. Disease is irrelevant, immortality is a given (in the sense of extremely long life; the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe\">heat death of the universe</a> might still pose a problem). People choose their own pseudo-physical form in virtual spaces for which reason physical appearance is not a factor in social rank, gender assignment at birth causes few problems and racism in the modern sense is a non-issue.</p>\n<p>People are free to create whatever virtual spaces they want, within the (weak) resource constraints as long as they don't contain morally significant entities. Brain emulations without full citizen status are forbidden up to allowances for raising children. Cloning oneself is allowed but making children is subject to regulation for the child's benefit.</p>\n<p>Access to the physical layer of reality is strictly regulated. It is allowed only for pragmatic reasons such as scientific research with the goal of extending the current civilization lifespan even more. All requests for access are reviewed by many people, only minimal necessary access is approved and the process is monitored in real-time. By these means, the threat of malevolent groups breaking the system through the physical layer is neutralized.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Superrational_Posthumanity\">Superrational Posthumanity</h3>\n<p>Human intelligence is modified to be much more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrationality\">superrational</a>. This effectively solves all <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">coordination problems</a>, removing the need in government as we understand it today. This scenario assumes strong modification of human intelligence is feasible which is a weaker assumption than the ability to create de novo AI but a stronger assumption than the ability to create whole brain emulations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Other_Scenarios\">Other Scenarios</h2>\n<p>There are scenarios which are difficult to classify as \"dystopian\" and \"utopian\" due to strong effect of certain parameters and different imaginable \"cryonic wake up\" scenarios. Such scenarios can be constructed by mixing dystopian and utopian scenarios. This includes scenarios with several classes of people (e.g. free citizens and slaves, the latter existing as emulations for the entertainment of their masters) and scenarios with several \"species\" of people (people with differently modified minds).</p>\n<h1 id=\"Intervention_Types\">Intervention Types</h1>\n<p>I distinguish between 4 types of interventions with long-term impact. The types of intervention available in practice depend on the point in which you are located on the progress timeline, with type I interventions available virtually always and type IV interventions available only next to a progress branching point. I give some examples of existing programmes within those categories, but the list is intended to be far from exhaustive. In fact, I would be glad if the readers suggest more examples and discuss their relative marginal utility.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Type_I__Sociocultural_Intervention\">Type I: Sociocultural Intervention</h2>\n<p>These are interventions that aim to \"raise the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/1e/raising_the_sanity_waterline/\">sanity waterline</a>\" (improve the average rationality of mankind, with higher weight on more influential people) and/or improve the morality of human cultures. The latter is to be regarded from the point of view of the person or group doing the intervention. These interventions don't assume a specific model of long-term scenarios, instead striving to maximize the chance that humanity chooses the right path when it reaches the crossroads.</p>\n<p>Example of a type I interventions include\u00a0<a href=\"http://rationality.org/\">CFAR</a>\u00a0and the EA movement. Other examples might include educational programmes, atheist movements and human right movements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Type_II__Futures_Research\">Type II: Futures Research</h2>\n<p>These are interventions that aim to improve our understanding of the possible future scenarios, their relative value and the factors influencing their relative probability. They assume the current state of progress is sufficiently advanced to make discussion of future scenarios relevant. For example, in 1915 nobody would be able to envision whole brain emulation, AI or nanotechnology.</p>\n<p>Examples include <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">FHI</a>, <a href=\"http://cser.org/\">CSER</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/\">FLI</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http://gcrinstitute.org/\">GCRI</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Type_III__Selective_Progress\">Type III: Selective Progress</h2>\n<p>These are interventions that try to accelerate progress in selected areas with the aim of increasing probability of desirable scenarios. They assume the current understanding of future scenarios is sufficiently advanced to know the dependence of the relative probabilities of future scenarios on progress in different areas.</p>\n<p>One example is <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/\">MIRI</a> who try to accelerate progress in AGI safety relatively to progress in AGI in general. Other possible examples would be research programmes studying defense against bioengineered pandemics or nanoreplicators.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Type_IV__Scenario_Execution\">Type IV: Scenario Execution</h2>\n<p>These are interventions that aim at direct realization of a specific scenarios. They assume the relevant technology already exists.</p>\n<p>As far as I know, such interventions are still impossible today. Theoretical examples include an FAI construction project or a defense system against bioengineered pandemics.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Summary\">Summary</h1>\n<p>Long-term thinking leads to somewhat counterintuitive conclusions regarding the most effective interventions. Interventions aiming to promote scientific and technological progress are not necessarily beneficial and can even be harmful. Effective interventions are focused on changing culture, improving our understanding of the future and accelerating progress in highly selected areas.</p>\n<p>Many questions remain, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the importance of cultural interventions in first world versus third world countries?</li>\n<li>Progress in which areas is beneficial / harmful, to the extent of our current ability to predict?</li>\n<li>What are the relative marginal utilities of existing programmes in the 4 categories above?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><sup>1</sup>\u00a0There is a possibility that the <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Unfriendly_artificial_intelligence\">UFAI</a> will <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Acausal_trade\">bargain acausally</a> with a <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence\">FAI</a> in a different <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation\">Everett branch</a>, resulting in a Utopia. However, there is still an enormous incentive to increase the probability of the FAI scenario with respect to the UFAI scenario.</p></div></div>"},

{"date": "5th Jan 2015", "title": "TLYCS Pamphleting Pilot Program", "author": "jonathonsmith", "num_comments": "34 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span> </span></p>\n<p>I\u2019m working on a pamphleting pilot program with the folks over at The Life You Can Save, and I wanted to lay out our plans and hopefully field some useful thoughts and criticisms. First, a couple notes on the motivation for this project. Pamphleting has been used by other advocacy groups (with positive, although debatable, results), but to my knowledge hasn't been tried by an EA-flavored global poverty organization, so we're giving it a shot. There is arguably something old-fashioned and appealing about being handed a physical booklet from a real person that differentiates this medium from, say, online ads, and promotes (or so the argument goes) a deeper level of engagement. We're hoping that the data we collect, which TLYCS will be using to decide whether to continue it's program, will be useful to other groups as well, so we wanted to field some feedback here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The basic thrust of the project is right out of the Vegan Outreach playbook; put together a leaflet that targets college age students with material relating to global poverty interventions and effective altruism, and hand them out on college campuses on a rolling, semester basis. Whereas for VO the ultimate goal of pamphleting is to make vegans, the goal for the TLYCS pamphlets is to get students to engage with the material <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\">on the website</a> and then take <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/take-the-pledge\">TLYCS's pledge</a>. We have our pamphlet nearly finished and plan to start handing them out this spring semester at Southern California universities. In this pilot program, we really want to, 1.) explore the logistical challenges in running this kind of activity, and 2.) try and gauge the effectiveness of pamphleting versus other methods of spreading the message. It is on point two that I am keen to get feedback, so I\u2019ll outline our current thoughts on this.</p>\n<p>I plan to hand out pamphlets on discrete days during the pilot period (say, every other friday for several months), and keep track of how many booklets are handed out during each distribution. This should allow us to monitor traffic spikes (or lack of them) to the website from IP addresses in the distribution zone, as well as spikes in pledge signups, which can serve as a preliminary indication of engagement. We will also be pushing a special landing page that is only advertised in the pamphlets as another metric to gauge impact. This would be analogous to VO\u2019s vegetarian starter guide offer, in that the offer require's the reader to actually do something, and therefore ostensibly reflects a more significant level of engagement. We initially envisioned directing students to a \u201cspecial message\u201d from TLYCS, which might be a video from Peter Singer or someone else in the organization offering an in-person invitation to explore the site and take the pledge. Another thought was to invite students to play an online version of TYLCS\u2019s Giving Game, where they visit the website and choose which of four charities will receive a dollar donation. However, there was some disagreement on the team whether offering a strong \u201chook\u201d to get people to come to the site would muddy the effectiveness of the pamphlet qua pamphlet. For instance, TLYCS offers in-person Giving Game workshops, and it was thought that pitching an online version of the Giving Game in the pamphlets would make it harder to compare the effectiveness of the pamphlets versus the in-person workshops. As something of a compromise, we are now inviting students to <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/quiz\">take a quiz</a> (just a shell site right now) in which they answer questions and then get paired up with one of TLYCS\u2019s recommended charities. I\u2019d be very interested in what people think on this point; what\u2019s the right balance between pushing a really strong hook in the pamphlet (e.g. video from Peter Singer, invitation to play Giving Game), versus keeping the pamphlet as independent as possible so we can tell how engaging of a medium it is?</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we\u2019d like to come out of the pilot program with a metric that falls somewhere close to \u201ccost per TLYCS pledger via pamphlets\u201d that we can compare with other outreach efforts (online ads, in-person workshops, etc), and use in deciding whether to expand the program or abandon it. To summarize, I\u2019m really interested in hearing comments on:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are we making any obvious mistakes in our approach to measuring the effectiveness of the pamphlets?</li>\n<li>What is the right balance to strike between pitching a strong \u201chook\u201d in our pamphlets versus keeping them \u201cclean\u201d so that only the appeal of the pamphlets as a medium is measured?</li>\n<li>Is there anything we can tweak in our pilot that would make it more relevant and useful to other organizations considering a pamphleting program?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p>Thanks all, and look forward to hearing from you!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "6th Jan 2015", "title": "EA Origin Story: Changing", "author": "Bitton", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>Cross-posted from <a href=\"http://a-nice-place-to-live.blogspot.ca/2015/01/changing.html\">A Nice Place To Live</a>.</em></p>\n<p><span>For this month's Figuring Good Out, the topic is \"EA origin stories.\"\u00a0I don't think of myself as \"</span><em>an</em><span>\u00a0EA\" and I can't remember how things happened very well. Looking back, the years blend together and I can't quite remember the cause-and-effect of it all. But here's a story.</span></p>\n<p><span> I've always been interested in philosophical questions and arguments.\u00a0I think my main obsessions as a teenager were art (what makes \"good art\" good?), morality (what makes \"good deeds\" good?), and atheism. Coming from a broken home where I spent alternating weekends with my orthodox Jewish father and my basically-secular Jewish mother, I grew up in a uniquely good environment to produce anti-religious views. I'd go from eating McDonald's one day to waiting six hours between meat and dairy the next. One Saturday I'd watch cartoons all day and eat in front of the TV. The next Saturday I'd have to go to synagogue and sit silently through\u00a0<em>kiddush</em>. Who could grow up in these conditions and see the religious bits as anything other than unnecessary inconveniences?</span><span><br> </span><span><br> I never lost my faith, I just never believed to begin with. I remember one of the teachers at my Jewish high school asking the class about their religious beliefs. I was surprised at all the hands going up. I remember walking home as a teenager and the thought occurring to me for the first time that everyone else\u00a0<em>actually believes this stuff</em>. When hearing the stories from the Old Testament as a kid, I had always thought of them as fables like Jack and the Beanstalk and The Boy Who Cried Wolf. It had weirdly never really occurred to me that everybody around me, including the adults, thought Jonah and the Whale was non-fiction.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> When the New Atheism movement emerged, I was an easy sell. Dawkins and Hitchens led me to Harris and Dennett, who led me to Pinker, Krauss, and Singer, who led me to the Churchlands and to science communicators like Michio Kaku, Neil Degrasse Tyson, Brian Greene, and Dan Ariely. And the arguments against religion brought me to David Hume and Bertrand Russell and the circle kept expanding.\u00a0</span><span><br> </span><span><br> I took some philosophy electives in school: Intro to Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Mind, and then another course that talked exclusively about Kant for the first half (and then apparently talked exclusively about Hegel for the second half but I stopped going by that point). I kept reading. Sam Harris's book\u00a0<em>The Moral Landscape</em>\u00a0got me to change my mind about one of my favourite topics. At the time, I had a softer stance on morality where nothing could be objectively good or bad because something-about-culture. Still though, becoming a consequentialist had no real effect on my behaviour. I read his book, agreed with his arguments, changed my beliefs, and did nothing.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> Fortunately, I had already read two books by Peter Singer in my first year of university. The first,\u00a0<em>The Life You Can Save</em>, I read after my Philosophy of Science teacher told our class about an argument that one moral philosopher makes for giving to the poor. He confessed that although the argument had initially made him feel guilty, he'd found possible weak points in the philosopher's premises after further consideration. I had never heard of Peter Singer before but I, for one, had not been able to find these weak points and was still feeling guilty. I read his book, agreed with his arguments, changed my beliefs, and did nothing.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> The second book I read by Peter Singer was\u00a0<em>Animal Liberation</em>. I had always been kind of sympathetic to animal suffering but never really cared enough to inconvenience myself over it. Singer's book was an eye opener for me. He kept quoting this amazing passage by Jeremy Bentham (who I'd never heard of) that made everything clear. Although I became very confident that eating animals was immoral, and tentatively thought that I would like to become a vegetarian in the future, my general stance on the issue was: eating meat is bad but I just don't care. I read his book, agreed with his arguments, changed my beliefs, and still I did nothing.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> This sort of pop philosophy and pop science became one of my main past times. I read articles from my favourite philosophers on a daily basis. A friend and I began a pact where every day we'd send each other one new article to read. I remember the excitement I'd found when, after about a week of doing this, I discovered Daniel Dennett's <a href=\"http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/bibliography.html\">Tufts University page</a> online. It contained the PDFs for what seemed to be every article he'd ever written, spanning back several decades. I decided to read through all of them in order, a few each day. I never got more than a few articles deep. My friend called me one day to tell me that everything had changed - that he had found enough reading material to keep us both busy for ages - it was endless - it was all compiled into neat sections on this one website - and so my attention turned toward LessWrong.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> My friend had been in a phase of figuring out what he wanted to do with his life, so he was emailing all sorts of folks in various professional fields to ask for advice. One of these people worked for an organization called the Singularity Institute. The employee (Malo), sent my friend a long list of reading material, including the Sequences. I began reading and it was right up my alley.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> There's a specific feeling I get when I have more exciting reading material than I have energy to stay up any longer. I can't remember how long it took me to read the Sequences but I know that I was reading for hours a day and I have particularly warm memories of the How to Actually Use Words section.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> Through these, I got into \"rationality\" and became more interested in cognitive biases. I read\u00a0<em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>\u00a0and it became my new favourite book. I read\u00a0<em>Nudge</em>\u00a0by Thaler and Sunstein. I read Luke Muehlhauser's\u00a0<a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/\"><span>Common Sense Atheism</span></a>\u00a0blog basically cover to cover within a month. I read mountains of material, agreed with many arguments, changed my beliefs many times, and still I did nothing.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> At some point, I heard the term \"effective altruism.\" It may have been on LessWrong. It may have been on Luke's podcast. It may have been from Peter Singer. Or from my friend. Or from following Eliezer Yudkowsky on Facebook. The origin of my EA story is the fuzziest part of my EA origin story.\u00a0At any rate, I discovered the movement and felt no resistance to any of its ideas.\u00a0As mentioned earlier, I had already bought Singer's argument for EA from the moment my teacher told it to my class, years prior.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> The ideas had grown on me to the point that I was becoming more interested in all this rationality and philosophy talk than I was in the topic of my career and education. When I entered my MA in Media Production, I had no ideas at all for the sort of creative video project I had planned to produce. My mind was in philosophy mode. A couple of epiphanies about art later, I decided to write a thesis paper about what an effective altruist worldview has to say about artistic value.\u00a0<span><a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/8094582/Fiction_Fast_and_Slow_Narrative_Media_As_A_Tool_for_Social_Change\">My paper</a>\u00a0</span>transformed many times in the telling but it sort of stuck to that theme.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> In the early days of researching my paper, I began to realize how big my topic was. If I wanted it to be as good as my favourite books and papers, I'd have to learn a lot more. I\u00a0emailed Brian Tomasik, whose blog I had been reading. In hindsight, I don't know why I emailed him given that my project had so little to do with his subject matter. He responded that no, I didn't need to learn game theory and to my surprise, he added me on Facebook. For the past year or so, I've asked Brian a totally random question on Facebook about once a month (\"hey, so how does eating meat compare to buying from Nike?\"). He played a big part (along with the documentary,\u00a0<em>Earthlings</em>) in me finally becoming a vegetarian.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> Now that I think about it, when I first emailed Brian, I asked him if I could join the Foundational Research Institute, naively thinking that I was qualified. He responded that I should create my own blog to showcase my abilities. I started A Nice Place To Live and posted 1+ post a day for the first month with Brian as my only reader.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> Slowly, in incremental steps, I approached the cluster of properties associated with effective altruism. I started reading GiveWell's blog. I familiarized myself with more theory on existential risk. I completed my thesis paper. I once donated $50 to the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/Default.aspx\"><span>Against Malaria Foundation</span></a>. But really, I've changed very little.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> Now, I participate in the EA blogging carnival that I created, post on the EA forum, have a bunch of EA Facebook friends, and I\u00a0<em>think</em>\u00a0a lot of EAs know who I am but I'm not sure about that. If at some point in this story, I crossed the threshold of EA-dom, I cannot point to any explicit point of origin.</span></p></div></div>"},

To put this in perspective, this is twice the already rapid speed of growth we experienced in 2013 when we grew over 50% in one year. Accordingly, the amount pledged has also risen from $147 million to $344 million. We have expanded from 15 chapters to 26, with additions appearing Europe, America, and worldwide. You can find the full list\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/chapters\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our online presence has grown as well, with an ever-increasing number of likes on\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/givingwhatwecan\">our Facebook page</a>\u00a0and followers on\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/givingwhatwecan\">our Twitter</a>, and a similarly high newsletter subscribership.

We decided to triple (Gift aid included) and raised almost 14,000 pounds.</span></span></h3>\n<p><span><span><br></span></span></p>\n<p><span>Our motivation besides raising money that wouldn\u2019t have been donated otherwise was to find people who haven\u2019t been involved in the EA community so far. We hoped we could try to draw in newcomers and get them to donate, in the hope they\u2019d donate more in the future. For those reasons, for evaluating the impact of our match, we aren\u2019t looking too closely at the money we have raised officially (not even taking into account the obvious concern that some of those donations would have happened anyway).</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Unfortunately, most of these benefits are difficult to assess. People who donated seemed to mainly come from EA-affiliated circles with some peopl</span><span>e being \u201ccore EAs\u201d and some people being more losely connected. We also had a few donations by people whom we suspect to be Alex\u2019 coworkers. This flags up a neglected benefit of Earning-to-Give-careers - more access to people who are able to donate large sums too. Those donations were also the highest we got, which highlights this benefit further. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>There were a few donations in the thousands, a decent chunk in the hundreds and many below a hundred pounds. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>We decided the amount based on how much we thought was achievable, but still high enough so it would bring out higher donations. So far, donation matches were capped at 4-figure sums*, while the largest donation we got was already more than 5,000 dollars. We hoped to anchor people with a high target. This seems to have worked. A smaller goal probably wouldn\u2019t have brought out as many &gt;$1000 donations. </span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Ben Kuhn mentioned in <a title=\"his post\" href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/matching\">his post</a> that matching a donation more than 1:1 doesn\u2019t seem to be worth it (this post appeared after we started the match). Since we wouldn\u2019t have gone for a higher amount even if we had done only 1:1 matching, there wasn\u2019t a cost to tripling. [Edit: Ben pointed out in the comments that this result was based on a direct mailing campaign, so it's unclear how well it translates to Social Media fundraising.]</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>On the cost side in general, we put a couple of hours in, but very few overall. The donation match was shared on Facebook and we had a few private conversations because of it, but again, very few. The money we put up for the donation match would have been donated anyway to AMF.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>The other cost was the match not filling up, though the effects of that are unclear. It might demotivate people in the future if there\u2019s a match with a similarly high goal. I think this is offset by the experimental value the match had.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Most donations happened in the first and the last week of the match, that\u2019s also when we tried to draw attention to it the most. We could probably have done the match over a shorter timeframe, so donations would have been more regular. This might have resulted in people being more motivated to donate, compared to when it looks like it\u2019s come to a halt. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Another reason behind the timing was the intention for the match to be Christmas related, since people are more likely to donate during that period. We were a bit late for that unfortunately, so in the future (combined with the reason above), we\u2019d rather do a match only for December. If you have any suggestions how to improve (our) donation matches in the future, we'd be happy to hear them. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><br></span></p></div></div>"},

As a result, we are now in a position to advance to CSER's next stage of development: full research operations. Over the course of this year, we will be recruiting for a full team of postdoctoral researchers to work on a combination of general methodologies for extreme technological (and existential) risk analysis and mitigation, alongside specific technology/risk-specific projects.</p>\n<p>Our first round of recruitment has just opened - we will be aiming to hire up to 4 postdoctoral researchers; details below. A second recruitment round will take place in the Autumn. We have a slightly unusual opportunity in that we get to cast our net reasonably wide. We have a number of planned research projects (listed below) that we hope to recruit for. However, we also have the flexibility to hire one or more postdoctoral researchers to work on additional projects relevant to CSER's aims. Information about CSER's aims and core research areas is available on our website. We request that as part of the application process potential postholders send us a research proposal of no more than 1500 words, explaining what your research skills could contribute to CSER. At this point in time, we are looking for people who will have obtained a doctorate in a relevant discipline by their start date.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I would also humbly ask that the Effective Altruism community aid us in spreading the word far and wide about these positions. There are many brilliant people working within the existential risk community. However, there are academic disciplines and communities that have had less exposure to existential risk as a research priority than others (due to founder effect and other factors), but where there may be people with very relevant skills and great insights. With new centres and new positions becoming available, we have a wonderful opportunity to grow the field, and to embed existential risk as a crucial consideration in all relevant fields and disciplines.</p>\n<p>Thanks very much,</p>\n<p>Se\u00e1n \u00d3 h\u00c9igeartaigh (Executive Director, CSER)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"The Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (University of Cambridge, UK) is recruiting for to four full-time postdoctoral research associates to work on the project\u00a0<em>Towards a Science of Extreme Technological Risk</em>.</p>\n<p>We are looking for outstanding and highly-committed researchers, interested in working as part of growing research community, with research projects relevant to any aspect of the project.\u00a0<strong>We invite applicants to explain their project to us, and to demonstrate their commitment to the study of extreme technological risks.</strong></p>\n<p>We have several shovel-ready projects for which we are looking for suitable postdoctoral researchers.

{"date": "1st Mar 2015", "title": "Results from a survey of people's views on donation matching", "author": "Ben_Kuhn", "num_comments": "3 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Since a lot of people lately have been discussing donation matching and the various issues about counterfactuals that surround it, I ran a survey a couple weeks ago to answer various of my questions about donation matching.</p>\n<p>You can read the full post <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/matching-results\">here</a>. I'm not going to cross-post the whole thing because it becomes difficult to keep the two versions in sync, but I'll include the \"conclusion for matching donors\" below to pique your interest. (Note that because it was only a survey of a small convenience sample, you should put limited weight on these conclusions! But I think they're useful nevertheless.)</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Be_transparent_about_your_matching\">Be transparent about your matching</h2>\n<p>Where will any unmatched funds go? Will they be donated to the same organization anyway? Given to a different charity? Burned? A strong majority thought that all matches were fully counterfactually valid, so if this isn\u2019t true of your match, you should say so. This could affect how much people donate, and how deceived they feel, so it\u2019s very important to be totally honest here.</p>\n<p>One thing that I didn\u2019t look at in this survey, but that merits future research, is another type of \u201cpartial validity\u201d in which unmatched funds don\u2019t go to the same charity, but go to another charity, sometimes a quite similar one. It\u2019s hopefully clear that this always happens for foundations, but it\u2019s not clear for private donors like HEA\u2019s anonymous matcher or one\u2019s friends. It\u2019s probably wise to be transparent about this in your fundraiser as well.</p>\n<p>Separately from concerns about honesty, I think transparency in matching is great for other reasons as well. It seems to me that by far the biggest benefits of many EA fundraisers are not just that they raise additional funds\u2014the best part is the flow-through effects from getting people to be more public about their giving, to discuss effective altruism more, and to get their friends interested. From that standpoint, it seems like a huge win to use the matches to introduce people to two central practices of effective altruism, transparency and counterfactual reasoning. It would also make the campaigns stand out more from typical fundraisers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Consider_running_a_challenge_instead_of_a_match\">Consider running a challenge instead of a match</h2>\n<p>The survey suggested that people found challenge fundraisers just as compelling as matches, and seemed to reduce their donations less when the challenge target was reached than when a match expired. Furthermore, with challenges, the counterfactual effects are much clearer: it\u2019s obvious where your money went, and the funding dynamics are much more intuitive.</p>\n<p>This is consistent with my interpretation of the donation matching literature, where I wrote that I expected matches to work mostly through social proof and urgency effects rather than through making people\u2019s donations bigger (and found, consistent with this, that changing the amount of the match tended not to matter). Challenge fundraisers don\u2019t make people\u2019s donations bigger like matches do, but they share the same urgency effect and function as stronger social proof. So it\u2019s not surprising that they work just as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Consider_running_a_larger_experiment\">Consider running a larger experiment</h2>\n<p>This survey produced some useful info, but it would be even better to have actual field experiments (and a larger sample size). The academic literature on matches is sparse enough, and the literature on challenges even more so. So any additional experiments could add a lot to our knowledge.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Once again,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/matching-results\">check out the full post</a>\u00a0if you're interested in learning more, or have questions that aren't answered above.

It means a lot to us, and it will mean a lot to the charities that we support.</p>\n<p>If you've considered giving to Giving What We Can, now is a great time to do it. Fundraising takes a considerable amount of time and energy. The longer it takes for us to reach our fundraising targets, the more time we have to spend on fundraising activities, and the less time we can devote to inspiring donations to our recommended charities. With our members contributing an average of over $60,000 in lifetime donations to top charities (time discounted and counter-factually adjusted), every member that we don't convince to join up is around 11,000 bednets that won't be distributed, nearly 80,000 people that won't be treated for Schistosomiasis, or 20 lives that won't be saved.</p>\n<p>If we fall short of our fundraising goal, we will not be able to offer a long-term position to our current Director of Communications. He has invaluable experience as a Communications Director for several high-profile Australian politicians, which has given him skills in web-development, public relations, graphic design, public speaking and social media. Amongst the things he has already achieved in his three months with us are: he has automated the book-keeping on our Trust (saving huge amounts of time and minimising errors), very much improved our published materials, written a press release and planned a media push to capitalise on our getting to 1000 members and Peter Singer\u2019s book release in the UK. His wide variety of skills mean that there are a large number of projects he would be capable of doing which would increase our member growth, and we are keen for him to test a number of these. But his first, if we can keep him on, is to optimise our website to make the most of the increased attention effective altruism will be generating over the summer and turn that into people actually donating 10% of their incomes to the most effective causes. In the past we have had trouble finding someone with such a broad set of crucial skills. Combined with how swiftly and well he has integrated into our team, it would be a massive loss to have to let him go and later down the line need to try to recruit a replacement.</p>\n<p>We believe that Giving What We Can is one of the most effective places you can donate - we calculate that for every dollar we spend on our operations, around $60 is donated to effective charities.

(Details of the forum will be finalized and shared with participants in the next few weeks.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"5_or_more_copies__Get_a_book_copy_customized_and_signed_by_Peter\">5 or more copies: Get a book copy customized and signed by Peter</h3>\n<p>One specially-marked \u201csupporter\u201d edition of the book\u2019s dust jacket will be signed by Peter and sent for each five copies purchased. This will fit the hardcover edition of the book, not the paperback edition being distributed in Australia and New Zealand. (Peter will sign this during his tour in mid-April, so please send an estimate of the count to <a href=\"mailto:chris@centreforeffectivealtruism.org\">chris@centreforeffectivealtruism.org</a> by 4/10 if you\u2019re planning to claim this.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"15_or_more_copies__Personalised_career_decision_analysis_by_80_000_Hours__1_per_15_copies__limited_to_20_total_across_the_whole_promotion_\">15 or more copies: Personalised career decision analysis by 80,000 Hours (1 per 15 copies; limited to 20 total across the whole promotion)</h3>\n<p>80,000 Hours will sometimes provide career decision analysis services, but limits the service by prioritizing clients by impact and charging a substantial fee. At the 15-book level, they will waive the fee and consult with you or anyone you designate to put together an individualized career decision analysis report. (It could be useful to consider who in your EA circles would benefit most from this.) This can be held onto to use at a later date, so we would recommend using this when you or the designee has a major career decision to make in the future.</p>\n<p><em>This level also includes the levels above: five invitations to the Q&amp;A forum and three signed \u201csupporter\u201d dust jackets.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"50_or_more_copies__Peter_talks_with_you_or_your_group_via_Skype\">50 or more copies: Peter talks with you or your group via Skype</h3>\n<p>For groups or individuals responsible for selling 50 books, Peter Singer will arrange to hold a conversation or Q&amp;A with your group via Skype after his book tour is completed. This could be a great way to create a major event to grow a smaller meetup group or keep your membership engaged. (Offered no more than once per group.)\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>This level also includes the levels above: invitations to the Q&amp;A forum for sixteen members, ten signed \u201csupporter\u201d dust jackets, and three separate offers of personalized career decision analysis (if the limit of 20 has not been reached).</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"How_to_participate\">How to participate</h3>\n<p>We would like to stay in touch with all of the local groups and individuals who are working on this promotion, so please let me know if you\u2019re thinking about setting up a book-selling event. If you\u2019re looking for ideas about how to make the promotion work, we can provide feedback and compare strategies across groups. Please write to the promotion\u2019s organizer, Chris Jenkins, at <a href=\"mailto:chris@centreforeffectivealtruism.org\">chris@centreforeffectivealtruism.org</a> if you\u2019re participating or considering an event plan!</p>\n<p>For prize claims, please hold onto your receipts (for online orders, this can be printed as PDFs) and write to us at <a href=\"mailto:prizes@centreforeffectivealtruism.org\">prizes@centreforeffectivealtruism.org</a>. If you would like more information about any of these plans or would like to discuss your own plans with us at the Centre for Effective Altruism, please let us know!</p>\n<h3 id=\"EA_groups__starting_a_book_selling_event\">EA groups: starting a book-selling event</h3>\n<p>The easiest way to do this if you have an active EA chapter or meet-up is to hold an event with an admission fee and give out copies of the book there. We can talk with you about planning and promoting these events as we communicate with other local groups about their approaches: please email Chris at <a href=\"mailto:chris@centreforeffectivealtruism.org\">chris@centreforeffectivealtruism.org</a>!</p>\n<h3 id=\"Duration_of_the_promotion\">Duration of the promotion</h3>\n<p>For claiming signed book jackets, please estimate the number you expect to claim and provide your estimate by Friday, 4/10/2015. For all other prizes, please stay in touch about your plans during the promotion, and be ready to send your receipts to <a href=\"mailto:prizes@centreforeffectivealtruism.org\">prizes@centreforeffectivealtruism.org</a> by Tuesday, 4/21/2015.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!

{"date": "15th Dec 2015", "title": "Effective Giving Merchandise - \"Be A Proud Superdonor\" ", "author": "Gleb_T", "num_comments": "10 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>I would like to introduce the first outcome of our efforts to create merchandise promoting the concept of effective giving, specifically through the idea of being a Superdonor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For those of you not familiar with earlier discussions, the purpose is to delineate effective altruist ideas from the movement itself, and promote these ideas in a fun and engaging form as \"<a href=\"/ea/qv/effective_giving_vs_effective_altruism/\">effective giving</a>.\" The goal is to get people emotionally engaged and excited about channeling their giving toward effective charities, while preventing a flood of new members into the EA movement itself, thus diluting the movement (more on this concern <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCOOtc-sofM&amp;feature=youtu.be\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/ea/pp/be_a_superdonor_promoting_effective_altruism_by/\">Superdonor concept</a> is one path to appealing to people's emotions and encouraging engagement with effective giving, without necessarily leading to the EA movement itself. Encouraging people to be Superdonors, meaning channeling their money to effective charities instead of ineffective ones and thus greatly multiplying the impact of their giving, can be done in a fun and engaging way, while also minimizing the problem of flooding the EA movement. Moreover, it highlights the benefits of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/976371585752532/\">everyday heroism</a>, as opposed to singular and epic heroism.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>While the Superdonor concept originally planned as mainly an online marketing campaign, discussions of the Superdonor concept led to EAs bringing up how to start conversations about effective giving in person around that topic. This led us to think about my <a href=\"/ea/p1/effective_altruism_merchandise_ideas/\">earlier post</a> on creating merchandise to promote effective altruist ideas to a broad audience. We thus worked on a design for the Superdonor concept, and got feedback on an early version of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153222032991088&amp;set=gm.966750963381261&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">Superdonor t-shirts</a> from fellow EAs. With that feedback, we have been working hard to create a more aesthetically appealing version, and one with a female and male version. The purpose would be for EAs to wear these shirts, and use them to spark conversations about effective giving. A secondary purpose would be for non-EAs who became enthusiastic about effective giving to wear these shirts and spread the message themselves. This is because the Superdonor concept implies within itself that Superdonors spread the message of effective giving.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here are the results of our work. We specifically focused on pride as an emotion since it worked for many other social movements as an inspiring message. I would appreciate your feedback on whether you think these shirts would serve the purpose outlined above. Would you or other EAs you know enjoy wearing them, and using them to share about effective giving in your conversations with non-EAs?</p>\n<p><img

{"date": "21st May 2015", "title": "Don't Be Discouraged In Reaching Out: An Open Letter", "author": "Evan_Gaensbauer", "num_comments": "19 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>\n<p><em><span> </span>Ben Kuhn recently wrote on how and why effective altruism may or may not seem welcoming to newcomers, and suggestions as to what could be done to make effective altruism more welcoming. He noticed a lack of diversity (within effective altruism) on lines such as age, career, lifestyle, socioeconomic class, level and type of education, etc. He notes everyone else might feel crowded out by some perceived mono-culture, and while like any community effective altruism might tend toward this failure mode by default, it's in everyone's interest to go beyond typical thinking in brainstorming new ways to welcome others.<br><br><span> </span>On some object-level issues Mr. Kuhn mentioned, debate broke out among commentators. Despite trying to quell or improve the quality of this debate as a moderator, Mr. Kuhn feels it degraded into acrimony, vitriol, and strawmanning. Indeed, some commentators expressed they might leave effective altruism behind entirely. He felt this fiasco discouraged him more than any explicit counter-argument that trying to build and hold together effective altruism as a singular community isn't worth it if there will be so much collateral damage to the movement and its adherents. Several dozen people appeared to agree with Mr. Kuhn's newfound pessimism, or at least they didn't disagree with it. I, on the other hand, strongly disagree. While I acknowledge effective altruism needs to look at itself, and thus strong optimism about its self-awareness may not be justified, I don't believe a doom-and-gloom outlook is justified either.<br><br>Below is my open letter to Ben Kuhn and effective altruism as a whole to not give up on the value of building community. It's been edited for brevity, and clarity. Note that I never originally discussed the object-level issues in debates which originally so discouraged Mr. Kuhn. I encourage you not to make your discussion of this open letter about that, as the pattern of falling into a debates in which we misrepresent each other is what urged this letter in the first place.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span>Hello\u00a0<span>Ben</span></span><span>. I hope you're doing well. I'm Evan Gaensbauer.</span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span>I</span><span> read your last blog post, and all the comments on it. It appears no more than five anonymous persons participated in these fights online you cited. Posting anonymously allows people to feel they can write comments online they otherwise wouldn't feel comfortable with.They may be expressing more extreme views than what they really hold in their everyday thoughts. Anyway, five anonymous people having a debate about one or two issues doesn't strike me as sufficient to stop trying to make the effective altruism community more welcoming. Maybe no one individual should try so hard to hold people together if it strains their willpower and capacity to handle stress. However, I don't think that's sufficient for all of us to stop trying, though. I don't want to get rid of having one thing called \"the EA community\". </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Effective altruism could become a movement of multiple communities, in which people of different political stripes or cluster-groups stick to their own. However, I'd be fine with that if everyone kept donating money to effective charities, discussed and debated what those were, while still largely agreeing with one another, and kept thinking about how they can lead lifestyles and careers which are more effectively altruistic. I think such a movement could be welcoming, as multiple communities, because when effective altruism stops being correlated with particular ideologies, it stops being an ideology itself, and people would think of it as common-sense. It stops being perceived as politics, and starts being perceived as the sensible mechanics of doing good. That would be great news.</span></p>\n<div>\n<p><span><span> </span> <span> </span></span>Five people debating in the comments on one blog? I bet, collectively, they spent less than five person-hours writing those comments. I can scarcely think of one individual in this community who hasn't spent dozens, if not hundreds, of hours learning more about effective altruism, ethics, and research to inform not just where they donate, but how to inject more altruism into lots of parts of their lives. That effort trumps political debate. For whatever reason, five people were drawn to one blog time and again over the course of five days, likely there for only minutes at a time, to have a debate which was refereed, rather than just deleted. These people weren't calling each other names, or swearing, or launching ad hominem attacks all the time. That's what I think of as \"calm\" and \"level-headed\". If you're in a bubble of people like that, even the most pessimistic people drawn to flame wars are more polite to one another than people I've witnessed arguing my entire life.</p>\n<p><span> </span>We can't measure how much \"acrimony\" is captured in these comments. Maybe these people went on with their days, slightly grumpy, but in a regular mood within the hour. Maybe not. We don't know, though, and I don't think that's substantial enough evidence to become so pessimistic. Surely someone was effected, as one or two commentators wrote they might leave effective altruism if it continues to be like this. If having these conversations in person isn't an option because these anonymous commentators aren't in the Bay Area, you or I could reach out personally, let them know an email or something, and chat with them on Skype. That takes the misinterpretation and misplaced vitriol out of Internet debates. Based on how dearly they consider their relationship with effective altruism, I imagine they're people we could trust personally and in discussion, and people we might already know.</p>\n<p><span> <span> </span></span>If people feel scared, threatened, and vulnerable, those are things which make effective altruism unwelcoming, but can be addressed.</p>\n<p>I have made hundreds of friends on Facebook through effective altruism. \"Facebook friends\" often means little, but what I mean is there are hundreds of individuals, strangers and acquaintances and role models, who want me to be part of their professional and personal networks, because they assume through association effective altruism makes us kindred spirits. I've met dozens of them in person. We lean on each other for emotional and moral support. Nobody is taking for granted the contributions of others. I'm honored people like yourself I aspire in my methods of thought and care to become more like treat me no less well than anyone else.</p>\n<p><span> </span>While there is a share of effective altruists who feel unwelcome, I think people can and do make enough friends and allies in this movement to keep their ear to the ground about effective altruism news. Never have I ever encountered someone who didn't feel welcomed by effective altruism, but then also abandoned their drive to do good works, or a desire for clearer thinking in assessing their own choices. Even if someone stops publicly affiliating with \"effective altruism\" the movement, if they still donate to effective charities, if they still make ethical lifestyle choices like vegetarianism or something else as it suits their values, then I think effective altruism has done it's job. In engaging the public, effective altruism's mission is use its passion to inspire confidence in others to take substantially effective action, not just symbolically signal association with a special group. Even if someone exits effective altruism, they can still donate to effective charities, they can still spread messages professionally and privately about quantifying efforts and evidence-based interventions, and they can still advocate. A piece of effective altruism can be left with them in all the good works they do for the rest of their lives.</p>\n<p><span> <span> </span></span>I'm not saying we should be totally optimistic about making effective altruism more welcoming. Effective altruism will never be perfect, and more struggles may come. I just mean five commentators this one week among the thousands of people becoming involved with effective altruism doesn't seem enough evidence to justify massive pessimism either. Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Evan Gaensbauer</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<hr>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p><em>When I wrote:<br></em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>I'm honored people like yourself I aspire in my methods of thought and care to become more like treat me no less well than anyone else.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span><span><em>this extends to anyone now reading this as much as it does Ben Kuhn. I've met some people I once thought of as personal heroes, such as Will MacAskill, founder of Giving What We Can, and Holden Karnofsky, founder of Givewell. When I met them, they told me how my thoughts, and the rationale behind my actions, even if they wouldn't agree with them perfectly, they definitely respected and were grateful for. That's why I think of these people as role models I can aspire to be like, not great men on a pedestal who have a status I can never achieve. I reflected on how personal friends I knew before getting involved with effective altruism, like Joey Savoie and Xio Kikauka, who founded Charity Science, or others who have donated thousands of dollars, like Andrew McKnight, of volunteered dozens of hours, like Eric Chisholm and Max Carpendale, should be my role models, too. </em></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><em></em></span></span><em><span> </span>Even very different people who I sense sincerely wish to make an effort, even if they can't always make the most effort, are kindred spirits in challenging themselves to do good even when they must make great effort to change their minds and actions to do so. It's this willingness which can act as a common core of effective altruism, feelings of solidarity and humility as being a peer alongside your own role models, which can also be the spirit with which we welcome others. We're not close to failing in that regard to give up hope, so let's keep trying.</em></p></div></div>"},

Again, I\u2019m here to inventory my goals and projects, explain how I\u2019ve accomplished them (or fallen short) throughout 2015 Q2, and then elaborate plans, goals, and projects for 2015 Q3. This is largely in response to <a href=\"/ea/i0/peters_2015_q1_personal_review/\">my previous review</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Note that despite this review being posted so late in July, it only covers the time period of 1 Apr 2015 through 1 Jul 2015. I have not added any additional information about things that have happened after 1 Jul. I\u2019ll endeavor to start doing these earlier, in the future.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"My_Day_Job\">My Day Job</h2>\n<p>I still work as a data scientist at a start-up in Chicago.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Q2_Goals\">Q2 Goals</strong></p>\n<p>My core goal was to think harder about improving as a programmer. I did that in <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/peterhurford/894b4e919b3e4a4836aa\">\u201cOne Year Out: How I Became a Better Programmer\u201d</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Right\"> What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p>As of the end of 2015 Q1, I\u2019ve now been programming professionally for one year -- three months as a software engineering intern and nine months as a Data Scientist.</p>\n<p>In the past reviews, I\u2019ve always looked back and admired how I\u2019ve been improving at becoming a better programmer. This quarter is no different.</p>\n<p>I studied writing good code more seriously this quarter, doing many of the things I suggest in <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/peterhurford/894b4e919b3e4a4836aa\">\u201cOne Year Out: How I Became a Better Programmer\u201d</a> -- reading books and pair programming.</p>\n<p>I also started branching into learning the beginnings of new programming languages, as seen in <a href=\"https://github.com/peterhurford/polygot-euler\">my attempt to solve Project Euler problems in many different popular programming languages</a>. I\u2019d eventually like to get to the point where I can start using programming languages because they\u2019re the right tools for the job, rather than just because I\u2019m comfortable with them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Wrong\"> What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>I spent much of this quarter caught up in a project that was supposed to be three weeks long, but dragged on to take over two months. I still firmly believe the reason for this is not my fault (and, to be fair, no one at the company seems to put any blame on me, even though people are annoyed). The task just required a lot more infrastructure changes than we first anticipated, and I fell down quite a few long roads of things that ended up not working.</p>\n<p>Every step it seemed like this would be the last hard step and the rest would come quickly. And I would be pretty good about not wasting too much time on any individual step and making sure to get help. But sure enough, once that step was complete, the next step would also be really hard. I didn\u2019t really figure out the whole meta-system until it was too late.</p>\n<p>Ideally, had I recognized this earlier, I could have substituted the project for something much simpler to \u201cbuy myself some time\u201d to figure out the more difficult stuff. However, this wasn\u2019t as bad as the two months wasted from Q1, since (a) this hasn\u2019t been as long and (b) it hasn\u2019t been nearly as avoidable in retrospect.</p>\n<p>To dwell on things that are under my control, I think I\u2019d like to focus more on getting back on the road and doing things. I can handle projects that slog on, but I\u2019m far happier if I also allow time to do projects that go quickly and carry with them opportunities for innovating technically and solving challenging projects.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Q3_Goals_\"> Q3 Goals </strong></p>\n<p>I\u2019ve introduced a metric called \u201cnumber of times a technical innovation has taken place within my day job work\u201d and I\u2019m going to aim to aim for at least three a week. I don\u2019t know if you can force innovation by making a goal for it, but it does seem a lot better than measuring hours and I think it will help me fight the tendency in myself to allow my days to slog on and just become a day of meetings where nothing of substance gets done.</p>\n<p>Another thing I\u2019d like to do is learn more about how we put predictive models into production. This seems like a useful skill with a lot of opportunities, but I don\u2019t understand it as well as I should. Now that I\u2019ve done a lot of work on gathering data, munging data, and fitting models to data, I want to complete the last part and earn the title \u201cfull-stack data scientist\u201d.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m also still going to try to learn more about programming, but I\u2019m moving that into my next section about learning goals.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Secret_Entrepreneurship_Projects\">Secret Entrepreneurship Projects</h2>\n<p>Since Sep 2014, I have been working with two friends, fiddling around with several different project ideas, exploring entrepreneurship. By Q2, we had two core projects to focus on: (1) a framework in R for developing predictive models more quickly and (2) another product. I\u2019d say more, but I still legally can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Q2_Goals\"> Q2 Goals</strong></p>\n<p><strong> Launch the modeling software project as an invite beta ASAP [fail].</strong> We did not successfully launch the predictive modeling framework project as we ended up prioritizing the other project instead.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Launch_the_modeling_software_project_as_an_open_beta_before_the_end_of_Q2__fail__\"> Launch the modeling software project as an open beta before the end of Q2 [fail].</strong></p>\n<p><strong> Be more confident that the other project is actually launchable [success].</strong> We ended up getting a real lawyer and paying a lot of money to find out that this sort of thing seems reasonably possible. I still have no idea how far it can go, though.</p>\n<p><strong> Move total revenue to &gt;$1K [success].</strong> We met this goal, but I\u2019m not really in a position to say how or why on a website that anyone can read.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Right1\"> What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p>During Q2 we really hit our stride with being able to devote a significant amount of time every week to moving our projects forward -- it\u2019s just that our projects ended up taking more time than anticipated.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Wrong1\"> What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing really went wrong this time around -- I think we worked on our projects to the best of our ability given our various constraints. For the predictive modeling project, we made the choice to do more programming work on it before deciding to release it and then we made the choice again to put it on hold to try and get the other project to the point where we could see if people are interested.</p>\n<p>Now that the second project is getting to the point where it needs more business development than technical development, we can circle back and try to finish the first project. And if it makes sense, we might even try to finish some projects that we considered earlier than that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Q3_Goals\"> Q3 Goals</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Launch the modeling software project.</li>\n<li>Figure out whether the other project will work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Learning\">Learning</h2>\n<p>In Q2, I\u2019ve been learning R programming (to get better at my job), mathematics (to get better at my job), and Chinese. The Chinese is a fun hobby and helps me bond with my girlfriend who is fluent in Chinese.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Q2_Goals_\"> Q2 Goals </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finish Advanced R [semi-fail].</strong> I finished 55% of Hadley Wickham\u2019s <a href=\"http://adv-r.had.co.nz/\">Advanced R</a> during Q1 and I wanted to finish the other 45% within Q2. Unfortunately, I did not realize how long the last 45% would take or how little time I\u2019d have in the end of Q2, so I only made it an additional +16%. I\u2019m still happy with my progress here, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Finish R Packages [success].</strong> At the end of Q1, I was 33% through Wickham\u2019s <a href=\"http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/\">R Packages</a>. I\u2019ve now finished the book and <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/peterhurford/f71bf00d8866094eac6c\">wrote up notes</a>.</p>\n<p><strong> Master &gt;75% of Khan Academy\u2019s Algebra II [semi-fail].</strong> By Q1, I had \u201cmastered\u201d 40% of <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/algebra2\">Algebra II on Khan Academy</a>. I thought that with enough of a push, I could finish the remaining 60% and move on. Unfortunately, this turned out to be far from the case, given how often Khan Academy forces you to review. By the time I had \u201cmastered\u201d 50%, the review became unbearable. I also started feeling that I was losing out conceptually and not spending enough time on the bigger picture. So I decided to move onto learning Calculus instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Have &gt;300 words in long-term memory on Memrise [semi-fail].</strong> I ended up abandoning Memrise. I decided that I\u2019d rather just learn on Skritter, because the mobile app was much better and the two were overlapping more than I had thought.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn &gt;75 words on Skritter [smashing success].</strong> In Q2 I actually reached 112 words learned, 86% more than I thought I would learn.</p>\n<p><strong> Finish the <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-chinese\">Chinese 101 Coursera class</a> [semi-fail].</strong> I ended up finding the course too basic and I kept getting annoyed at Coursera\u2019s new verifications process. Instead, I got enamored with <a href=\"http://english.cntv.cn/program/learnchinese/growingwithchinese/\">Growing Up with Chinese</a>, in which I completed the first fourteen lessons.</p>\n<p><strong>Complete &gt;5 more lessons in Rocket Chinese [semi-fail].</strong> I only completed three additional lessons, not six.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"What_Went_Right_\">What Went Right </strong></p>\n<p>The biggest success was switching to learning Skritter on the mobile app rather than the web application, which both expanded the amount of time I could spend practicing Chinese and expanded my motivation to actually do so. Now I can mess around with the mobile app when I\u2019m waiting in line or on the subway.</p>\n<p>Another thing I was happy with was figuring out what the best resources are for me, so that I spend more time focusing on good, non-overlapping resources and less time focusing on bad resources. For example, the Coursera class was good in the beginning, but quickly became too basic.</p>\n<p>Overall, this created a good workflow for me where I could listen to Chinese audio lessons on my walk to the subway and use Skritter while actually on the subway. Given a commute of 30min each way over five days, that would be five hours of Chinese practice I could do each week without sacrificing any \u201cproductive\u201d time. In practice, though, I tend to be less motivated to actually do this every commute, especially in the evenings.</p>\n<p>Similar logic applies for my goals of learning math or programming, though these are not possible to do while computing, because they require enough space on the subway to sit down and open a laptop, which I rarely have. <br><strong> </strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"What_Went_Wrong\">What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>Again, my progress was not particularly steady. I guess this is to be expected as motivation comes and goes and other pressing life events come in. Toward the end of Q2 I moved to a new apartment, which was quite draining across the board in allocating time to learning. Also, as I got more and more tied up in my current work project that was dragging on, I spent less and less time at work learning, eventually dropping things down to zero.</p>\n<p>Lastly, my goals for Q2 ended up being too ambitious, again. I think this time I\u2019m going to set my official goals at 50% of what I think I can do. I expect that once reality sets in, those 50% goals will turn out to be stretch goals. ;)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Q3_Goals_\">Q3 Goals </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finish Advanced R.</strong> For real this time.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn Haskell.</strong> A co-worker of mine is offering a twice weekly Haskell course at our work and I\u2019ve been enjoying it so far. It should complete by the end of Q3. I\u2019ll also supplement by skimming <a href=\"http://learnyouahaskell.com/\">\u201cLearn You a Haskell\u201d</a>. Together, these two things should set me up to try professional Haskell development by Q4.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn Calculus.</strong> I want to complete the <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus1\">Calculus I</a> course on Coursera. I also want to complete <a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/\">Strang\u2019s Calculus textbook</a> after, but I doubt I\u2019ll finish that by the end of Q3.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn Statistics</strong> by reading through <a href=\"http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/\">\u201cIntroduction to Statistical Learning\u201d</a>. I think I can get through Chapter 4 by the end of Q3. That would put completing the book by the end of 2016 Q1.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn Chinese.</strong> I\u2019ll try to learn 40 more words on Skritter, complete three more lessons on Rocket Chinese, and complete through lesson 17 on Growing up with Chinese.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn Cooking.</strong> I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019ll go about doing this yet. I\u2019d like to explore a bit before setting concrete goals. But I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll enjoy reading <a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Chef-Learning-Anything/dp/0547884591?sa-no-redirect=1\">The Four Hour Chef</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Personal_Health___Exercise\">Personal Health / Exercise</h2>\n<p>More important than nearly anything to a healthy and productive life is really nailing the core three: exercise, sleep, and food. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve struggled with these three so far my entire life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Q2_Goals1\"> Q2 Goals</strong></p>\n<p><strong> Get to work by 9:30am more often than not.</strong> This didn\u2019t happen, but I\u2019m not convinced that\u2019s a bad thing.</p>\n<p><strong> Go to gym at least once a week and running at least once a week.</strong> This did not happen either due to one week being very dominated by moving and another week being very dominated by trying to move the start-up idea forward. Overall, going to the gym and running both increased significantly, however.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Right2\"> What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p>For the first time in a long time (perhaps ever), I\u2019m cautiously happy with my diet, sleep, and exercise habits.</p>\n<p>For diet, just like last quarter, I\u2019m still very happy with the health of my current, vegetarian diet. I think putting it on Beeminder helped me keep it consistent and see that I do have some weakness in not eating enough fruit, which I think I can easily address.</p>\n<p>For exercise, I got to the gym and I went running much more than I did last quarter, though the habit still was not that regular and not as consistent as I would like. I think the time I go to the gym matters a lot for whether I\u2019ll actually do it. Previously, I would try to go during the middle of my workday, which didn\u2019t work very well because I would often get stuck in an unexpected meeting or feel like I should finish a particular project instead of leaving. So instead I moved my gym time to the end of the workday. This ended up being phenomenally successful until I started getting in the habit of staying at work until after the gym closed or going immediately from work to working on the start-up. I\u2019d love to try going before the workday, but I\u2019m not that motivated in the morning...</p>\n<p>For sleep, I finally got to a position where I was not constantly oversleeping and feeling crappy in the morning all the time. However, I still have not fallen into a consistent sleep schedule. Instead, I\u2019ve had two sleep schedules -- one really late, going to bed around 1:30am and waking up around 9:30am, and one really early, waking up around 6:30am and going to bed around 10:30pm. The early morning schedule feels the most virtuous to me and syncs better with the people I care about (and work), but -- as much as I hate to say it -- the late schedule is overall more productive for me and feels better. I\u2019m not really sure why that is.</p>\n<p>More generally, I think committing to less ambitious goals helped, since I ended up overshooting my less ambitious exercise goal all the way to be being better than my previous best. And I think <a href=\"http://www.beeminder.com/\">Beeminder</a> helps a lot for goal tracking and keeping the goals in my mind. What I did have trouble with, though, was maintaining a consistent definition of a goal, especially with regard to my shifting sleep schedule.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Wrong2\"> What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t say anything in particular went wrong, though it would be nicer to have a more consistent sleep and exercise schedule.</p>\n<p>I bought a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HF3520-Wake-Up-Colored-Simulation/dp/B0093162RM?tag=s4charity-20\">wake-up light</a>, but it didn\u2019t seem to help much at all beyond the first week. I think I just adapted to it. Eventually I moved into a new apartment with a window with actual light from the outside and I think that\u2019s been helping more recently.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t end up trying to go to the gym regularly with a friend and I didn\u2019t put any additional effort into improving my diet by preparing food in advance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Q3_Goals1\"> Q3 Goals</strong></p>\n<p>Honestly, if I could keep things where they are at or improve on them even a little bit, I\u2019d be pretty happy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"_impact_and_Charity_Science\">.impact and Charity Science</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com\">Charity Science</a> is a Canadian-based non-profit that aims to increase public awareness of GiveWell\u2019s recommendations and to figure out the best ways to effectively fundraise on their behalf.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dotimpact.im\">.impact</a> is a decentralized network of volunteers working on EA projects.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Right3\"> What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p>My goal for Q2 was to not get too involved in Charity Science or .impact so I could keep my focus. I succeeded in that goal and both organizations ended up doing very well anyway!</p>\n<p>The biggest victory here was delegation. I helped find and coordinate new volunteers to work on EA projects, including the EA Forum. I created a list of possible volunteer projects we\u2019re still looking for people to cover. Ozzie and Haseeb ended up organizing a workathon structure on Sundays for people to contribute their time and we\u2019ve seen a large spike in people\u2019s contributions. Huzzah!</p>\n<p>Charity Science ended up doing cool things too, but I don\u2019t really have much basis to take credit for any of it. I\u2019ll let them tell you more about it soon. It also involved doing very well with delegating to volunteers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Wrong3\"> What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>No particular mistakes to note on my behalf, mainly because I didn\u2019t do anything personally other than delegate. ;)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"New_Apartment\">New Apartment</h2>\n<p>I moved to a new apartment; my third apartment in twelve months.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"What_Went_Right\">What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p>This move was a good one for my long-term productivity and social happiness, because I now have a space that is large enough I don\u2019t go stir crazy and that I can work from a desk and a chair instead of from my bed. I\u2019ve already noticed a good deal of productivity increase since I finished my move and it allows me to have guests over, which is pretty awesome.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Wrong4\"> What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, however, the flip side of this was that I needed to devote about two full-time weeks to (a) looking for apartments (including conducting a wider apartment search than I\u2019ve ever done before to see what I really want in an apartment), (b) signing the lease (which ended up having complications), (c) packing up all my belongings, (d) moving all my belongings, (e) unpacking all my belongings, and (f) setting up the space (including furnishing it with more furniture than just a bed!).</p>\n<p>I\u2019m happy with how all these steps went. In particular, I was grateful to help from my girlfriend for help with looking for apartments, unpacking my belongings, and helping me set up the space. I\u2019m also grateful to my friend Josh for help with moving my belongings.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Q3_Goals2\"> Q3 Goals</strong></p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to not move again for at least another year.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Reading\">Reading</h2>\n<p><strong id=\"_Q2_Goals2\"> Q2 Goals</strong></p>\n<p>I had three goals mainly focused on consolidating knowledge I already had.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Expanding_summaries_of_books_that_I_ve_read_and_liked__goal_abandoned_\"> Expanding summaries of <a href=\"http://peterhurford.com/other/reading.html\">books that I\u2019ve read and liked</a> [goal abandoned]</strong></p>\n<p><strong id=\"_completing_an_organized_document_with_all_of_my_link_posts__goal_abandoned_\"> completing an organized document with <a href=\"http://peterhurford.tumblr.com/post/108765371191/links-when-i-feel-like-it-29\">all of my link posts</a> [goal abandoned]</strong></p>\n<p><strong> completing more links posts [partial success]</strong> -- I finished <a href=\"http://peterhurford.tumblr.com/post/123351181616/links-when-i-feel-like-it-34\">one</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Wrong5\"> What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t focus much in this area, instead allocating capacity to my other areas which needed it more. In Q2 I read five books, all on Audible (down from 11 finished in Q1). I generally found myself less motivated to read books as I found I was hitting diminishing marginal returns. Instead, I allocated my listening time toward Chinese lessons and <a href=\"http://www.gimletmedia.com\">listening to podcasts</a>.</p>\n<p>I had hoped to spend a good deal of time working to consolidate knowledge from the books and links I had already read, but this turned out to require more productive time than I anticipated (I couldn\u2019t just do it casually while commuting) and I was already stretched for time as it was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Q3_Goals_1\"> Q3 Goals </strong></p>\n<p>There\u2019s a large unsolved problem in how to actually apply the skills that you learn, so that they\u2019re integrated in your life in a deeper way than just being something you know surface-level. I think Paul Graham is somewhat right that <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/know.html\">this happens automatically</a>, but I still can recall many times in my life where I\u2019ve failed to apply something I had already learned and would have benefited had I actually applied it.</p>\n<p>Given that my capacity is already stretched and that I don\u2019t have a lot of ideas at the moment, I think I\u2019d like to spend another quarter just ruminating generally on how to approach this problem, with the goal of producing concrete Q4 goals in this area.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Social_Life\">Social Life</h2>\n<p>I want to include reflecting on my social life as a part of this guide because it\u2019s important to me, but I don\u2019t want to say too much here in order to respect privacy and because reviewing it this way still makes me feel weird.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Q2_Goal\"> Q2 Goal</strong></p>\n<p>My big goal here was to figure out a system for improving my consistency in communication with everyone I want to be in touch with. <a href=\"http://peterhurford.tumblr.com/post/123224704966/my-simple-plan-for-staying-in-touch-with-people\"> I hastily put one together at the end of the quarter. </a> It\u2019s working reasonably well so far, so I call that a success.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Right4\"> What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p><strong> My girlfriend:</strong> I think our relationship overall continues to grow stronger. Soon she\u2019ll be moving closer (but still long-distance) and I should be able to see her every other weekend, which will be great.

I have new friends who have recently moved to Chicago who I hope to see as well. I\u2019ve been in touch with some of them to schedule a time to hang out. My Q3 goal will be to hang out with all of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Distant friends:</strong> This has been going better as I\u2019ve been trying to keep more in contact with people over Facebook and the phone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Wrong6\"> What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>I want to involve my girlfriend more in my day-to-day life and I\u2019m struggling to (a) remember that when I make plans and (b) figure out how to do that.</p></div></div>"},

This has meant that our work has covered a fairly broad range across two areas - prioritisation and policy work.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our prioritisation work has been about identifying considerations and methods for choosing between different ways of helping the world. Our policy work has been exploring for high-value ways for the effective altruism community to interact with policy processes. A little over one-third of our work has been policy, and the rest prioritisation.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the next sections I\u2019ll give an overview of what we\u2019ve been doing in these areas. I\u2019ll cover most of our activities, but a few are excluded because (i) they were a small time investment and we do not regard them as that important; (ii) we are still exploring them and may not complete them; or (iii) the projects involve other people, and we are being cautious about not jeopardising relationships.</span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Prioritisation\">Prioritisation</strong></p>\n<p><span>We have three areas of prioritisation work:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Cause prioritisation</span></li>\n<li><span>Prioritisation within catastrophic risk reduction</span></li>\n<li><span>Academic prioritisation methodology</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><em><span>Cause prioritisation</span></em></p>\n<p><span>This work is aimed principally at people who are interested in making strategic choices about what areas to focus on in helping the world -- in particular the effective altruism movement. We focus on facilitating comparisons between diverse areas, rather than on making choices within areas. We have produced </span><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/09/flowhart/\"><span>a flowchart</span></a><span> as an overview and communication tool, and also have </span><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/give-now-or-later/\"><span>some posts</span></a> <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/03/ylds-and-ylls/\"><span>looking in depth</span></a><span> at </span><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/estimating-the-cost-effectiveness-of-research-into-neglected-diseases/\"><span>more</span></a> <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2014/06/human-and-animal-interventions/\"><span>specific</span></a> <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2014/06/on-causes/\"><span>issues</span></a><span>, for example trying to </span><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/MovementGrowth.pdf\"><span>compare movement growth to more direct work</span></a><span>. We have drawn on some of these tools (and the more methodological ones discussed below) to advise Effective Altruism Ventures on how to make comparisons between projects in very different areas. We are interested in developing the flowchart further into more detailed and interactive versions.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Prioritisation within catastrophic risk reduction</span></em></p>\n<p><span>This is a strand of work which grew out of cause prioritisation. We wanted to be able to provide principled comparisons between work on catastrophic risk reduction and other areas. We still regard this as a very high-value question we have not properly answered. However in investigating it we developed </span><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/allocating-risk-mitigation-across-time/\"><span>methods for comparing the value of different areas of work within catastrophic risk reduction</span></a><span>. This helped us to secure </span><a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/AI/2015awardees#Cotton\"><span>funding from the Future of Life Institute</span></a><span> to develop and extend the methodology for prioritisation within AI safety. Other work in this category looks at </span><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2014/07/the-timing-of-labour-aimed-at-reducing-existential-risk/\"><span>the timing of work on existential risk</span></a><span>, and at </span><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/08/quantifyingaisafety/\"><span>how we can produce crude estimates of the value of safety work in AI</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Academic prioritisation methodology</span></em></p>\n<p><span>This work aims to identify important considerations in prioritisation, and write them up rigorously so that they can be embedded in the academic discourse. We see this as an important long-term route to impact. Our largest work in this space is a paper we are just readying for journal submission on estimating the </span><em><span>ex ante</span></em><span> value of marginal research. This develops a project (within cause prioritisation) from last year in which we looked at </span><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/project-overview-problems-of-unknown-difficulty/\"><span>estimating the returns from working on projects of unknown difficulty</span></a><span>. Also in the category of academic prioritisation, Owen has prepared a book chapter on </span><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/05/discounting-for-uncertainty-in-health/\"><span>discounting for uncertainty in health</span></a><span>, and contributed to another on integrating the valuation of health and consumption effects.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Impact of prioritisation work</span></em></p>\n<p><span>It is hard to estimate exactly what the impact of different bits of this research is. Particularly the academic work has quite a long feedback loop, and for some of the other research we see the main value in its capacity to inform future more developed research. Nonetheless we are interested in tracking which parts of the work seem to be particularly valuable, and are worth pursuing further or looking for opportunities to disseminate more widely. To date, we have mostly been evaluating this by (i) asking people whose judgement we trust which work is important, (ii) seeing which work is cited by others, and (iii) looking at which work gets most views on our website.</span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Policy\">Policy</strong></p>\n<p><span>Our work in policy so far has largely been driven by high-value opportunities. We have seen two kinds of opportunity: where we have a particularly good connection to specific people, or where we have an idea that seems important.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Catastrophic risk and policy</span></em></p>\n<p><span>Much of our policy work has been helping to steer policy conversations around catastrophic and existential risk. We coordinated and wrote a policy report on </span><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/unprecedented-technological-risks/\"><span>Unprecedented Technological Risks</span></a><span>, which was shared within the UK government, and led to two of the authors being invited to write a chapter in the Government Chief Scientific Advisor\u2019s annual report. More recently, we have been </span><a href=\"http://anglejournal.com/article/2015-06-global-risk-the-wildfire-in-the-commons/\"><span>exploring</span></a><span> more detailed categorisations of sources of risk (further work forthcoming). Based on this existing work, we have secured funding from the Finnish Foreign Ministry to write a report on existential risk and governance, and we have begun preparation work for this.</span></p>\n<p><span>The UK runs a national assessment of possible catastrophic risks, assessing them on likelihood and impact. We noticed that parts of the methodology they used for assessing impact was not well-grounded. We sent a </span><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Risk-Register.pdf\"><span>short document</span></a><span> explaining how we thought this might be improved to the team working on it, had a meeting with them, and sent a </span><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Impact-and-response-assessments.pdf\"><span>second document</span></a><span>. They are in the process of concluding a review of their methodology, and our understanding is that they have made some changes in the direction of our recommendations, and that we represented a good fraction of the voices pushing for these changes (although at least some were also requested by others). We think getting the methodology correct on this assessment could lead to switching the order of concern about some risks and lead to more appropriate research allocation. We hope that it may be taken up in other large-scale risk assessments.</span></p>\n<p><span>A specific area we are interested in is biosafety policy. This seems an important and timely area. We published a </span><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/unprecedented-technological-risks/\"><span>preliminary policy idea</span></a><span> last year which was well-received by some people in the biosafety community. Since then we have continued conversations, and looked at the broader academic literature on incentives and risks. More recently, this summer we had a postdoc in life sciences join us as an intern and prepare neutral overviews of the risks, benefits and possible responses to \u201cgain-of-function\u201d work in influenza.</span></p>\n<p><em><span>Other high-value policy opportunities</span></em></p>\n<p><span>We\u2019re interested in other places where an effective altruist perspective may be useful in informing policy. We think this is important, because most people in policy are trying to help, and identifying good policy can be difficult. So far much of our work here has been strategic. We are developing one policy suggestion on improving the clarity of communication of statistics by governments.</span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"People\">People</strong></p>\n<p><span>The Global Priorities Project was started in January 2014. At that time it had 75% of Owen Cotton-Barratt\u2019s time focusing on research, and a small amount of time from other individuals at the Centre for Effective Altruism and Future of Humanity Institute, notably Niel Bowerman.</span></p>\n<p><span>In January 2015, Seb Farquhar joined full time in a research and project management capacity. In July, Seb took on a role as Executive Director of the Centre for Effective Altruism, and reduced his time on GPP to 50%. </span></p>\n<p><span>We have also been fortunate enough to have some very talented interns join us over the summers, typically for 6-8 weeks. In 2014, Max Dalton worked with us. In 2015, Hong-Sheng Lim, Nick Phillips, Daniel Kokotajlo, and Nicolas Moes worked with us.</span></p>\n<p><span>The total time (full time equivalent) that has been devoted to GPP to date is therefore roughly:</span></p>\n<p><span>Owen Cotton-Barratt: 16 months</span></p>\n<p><span>Seb Farquhar: 7 months</span></p>\n<p><span>Niel Bowerman: 2 months</span></p>\n<p><span>Interns: 8 months</span></p>\n<p><span>Others: 1 month</span></p>\n<p><span>Total: 34 months (14 months in 2014, 20 months in 2015)</span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Future_directions\">Future directions</strong></p>\n<p><span>Historically we have pursued both prioritisation and policy work. We see them both as high-value activities, and the opportunities were good enough that we wanted to take them. However, it is not necessary that they are combined in one organisation, and we are looking at separating out these workstreams more explicitly.</span></p>\n<p><span>We\u2019re also interested in increasing our attention to areas other than existential risk. A year ago, we thought this was significantly neglected for both policy and prioritisation. However it is getting increasing amounts of attention, and this means that going forward it may not be the most neglected area. We are heavily engaged in the area, and our current funding is focused on this, but we are interested in pushing more on strategy/prioritisation more broadly, and on other areas of policy.</span></p>\n<p><span>Also note that we are </span><a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/careers\"><span>currently hiring</span></a><span>. We are looking to bring on more researchers and to build our policy team.</span></p>\n<p><small>[<a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/10/update/\">Cross-posted from our website</a>.

{"date": "27th Dec 2015", "title": "Moral anti-realists don't have to bite bullets", "author": "Lila", "num_comments": "9 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Biting bullets (accepting a moral argument that's intuitively unpleasant because one feels logically compelled to) is central to many people's experiences in EA. In fact, bullet-biting often resembles a contest to demonstrate one's commitment to EA. I have even heard someone brag of having \u201cteeth of steel for biting bullets\u201d.</p>\n<p>However, the compulsion to bite bullets is at odds with moral anti-realism, another popular belief among EAs. If there is no objective morality, then there is no reason to prefer a principled, fundamentalist morality to an ad hoc, intuitionist morality. In fact, for the following reasons, it would be expected that bullet-biting does not accord with most people's experiences of morality.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Is_morality_law_like__\">Is morality law-like? </strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The paper \u201cIs Life Law-Like?\u201d criticizes the quest of biologists to derive laws for their observations, pointing out that evolution leads to ad hoc solutions and that biological processes occur probabilistically. So is morality closer to physics or biology? An empirical approach to morality would view it as stemming from evolutionary psychology, social structures, and historical serendipity. Psychology, sociology, and history are some of the only fields even less law-like than biology. Attempts to derive laws for morality are largely confined to recent Western history.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott Alexander argues for <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/26/high-energy-ethics/\">\u201chigh-energy ethics\u201d</a>, the idea that only through extreme thought experiments and edge cases can we discern the true nature of morality. The allusion to physics is no accident: it is the only discipline that thrives in such extremes. Applying such an approach to psychology would be absurd. For example, some psychologists believe that tall men are viewed as more attractive. One psychologist tries to disprove this by engineering a nine-foot-tall man, who is not viewed as more attractive. Of course, she didn't actually refute the hypothesis, only demonstrated that observations in the social sciences are context-dependent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Optimizing_for_multiple_values\">Optimizing for multiple values</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A popular bullet to bite is an argument of the form \u201cX is theft/rape/murder\u201d, where X is an act that is widely believed to be morally acceptable but that has superficial similarity to a serious crime. This has been called <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/e95/the_noncentral_fallacy_the_worst_argument_in_the/\">the worst argument in the world</a>. The reason that it's naive and often rejected is that serious crimes are typically viewed as immoral for multiple reasons. Murder is immoral because, among other reasons, it causes fear and suffering through the act itself, the victim had a desire to continue living, the victim would have had future positive experiences, and the death brings grief to family and friends. X typically has one or several of these characteristics but not all, so it is commonly judged to be not as bad as murder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Morality becomes even more complex when it involves competing values. There is no inconsistency in believing that airports should X-ray luggage to reduce security risks and simultaneously believing that widespread surveillance of citizens is unjustified. One can value both security and privacy and believe that in some cases one outweighs the other. This point is often lost in bullet-biting morality, which views \u201cinconsistency\u201d as a product of hypocrisy and cowardice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Optimizing for a single value when one has multiple values will almost always lead to the sacrifice of some values. Paying workers by the hour leads to slow work; paying by the task leads to shoddy work. Similarly, optimizing for naive definitions of utility <a href=\"/ea/nq/might_wireheaders_turn_into_paperclippers/\">will lead to paperclipping</a>. For example, if we believe in one definition of utility, we may end up with a universe tiled with thermostats. (Each thermostat is \u201chappy\u201d because it is programmed to \u201cwant\u201d the temperature of the cosmic background radiation.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Moral anti-realism doesn't like neat conclusions: though there's no reason to favor biting bullets, there's no reason to disfavor it either. However, I have two pragmatic observations. First, the pressure to bite bullets (and the implication of irrationality if one does not) can be be off-putting to some EAs. Second, it may be easier to maintain commitments to beliefs if they are sincere, rather than conclusions that you grudgingly accept because you see no other choice.</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "12th May 2015", "title": "Should you give your best now or later?", "author": "Diego_Caleiro", "num_comments": "17 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>We can probably influence the the world in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Doing-Good-Better-Effective-Difference/dp/1592409105/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431398836&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=william+macaskill\">the near future</a>, as well as in <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2014/05/04/we-can-probably-influence-the-far-future/\">the far future</a>, and both <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_High_and_Letting_Die\">near</a> and <a href=\"https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/40469/\">far</a> seem to matter.</p>\n<p>The point I want to convey here is that, unless you are living in a particularly unusual time of your personal history, <strong>the influence you can have on the world in the next 2 years is the most important influence you will have in any future pair of years</strong>. To do that I will use personal stories, as I did in <a href=\"/ea/9l/types_of_planners_and_plans_for_eas/\">my last post</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Let us assume for the time being that you care about the far future a substantial amount. This is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/834447989944893/\">a common trend</a> that many though not all EAs have converged to after a few years of involvement with the movement. We are assuming this to steel-man the case against the importance of the next 2 years. If what matters is over a 100 years into the future, which difference could 2015 to 2017 make?</p>\n<h3 id=\"Why_what_I_do_now__relatively__doesn_t_matter_anymore\">Why what I do now, relatively, doesn't matter anymore</h3>\n<p>I believe the difference to be a lot. When I look back at the sequence of transformations that happened to me and that I caused after being a visiting fellow at the old version of MIRI, the birth of EA me, one event stands as more causally relevant than, quite likely, <em>all others put together</em>. Giving a short TED on Effective Altruism and Friendly AI. It mattered much. It didn't matter that much because it was good or not, or because it conveyed complex ideas to the general public - it didn't - or whichever other thing a more self-serving version of me might have wanted to pretend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It mattered because it happened soon, because it was the first, and because I nagged the TED organizers about getting someone to talk about EA at the TED global event (the event was framed by TED as a sort of pre-casting for the big TED global 2013). TED 2013 was the one to which Singer was invited. I don't know if there was a relation. <br>If \u00a0I went to the same event, today, that would be a minor dent, and it hasn't been three years yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fiction: Suppose now I continue my life striving to be a good, or even a very good EA, I do research on AGI, I talk to friends about charity, I even get, say, one very rich industrialist to give a lot of money to Givewell recommended charities in late 2023 at some point. It is quite likely that none of this will ever surpass the importance of making the movement grow bigger (and better) by that initial acceleration, that single one night silly kick-starter.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_leveraging_power_you_can_still_have\">The leveraging power you can still have</h2>\n<p>Now think about the world in which Toby Ord and Will MacAskill did not start Giving What We Can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The world in which Bostrom did not publish Superintelligence, and therefore Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Steve Wozniak didn't turn to \"our side\" yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The EA movement is growing in number, in resources, in power, and in accessing the people in positions of power. You can still change the derivative of the growth curve so it grows faster, like they could have done in the joke below:\u00a0</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://frivolousendeavour.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/dark-ages.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>But not for long. Soon we will have exhausted all incredibly efficient derivative increasing opportunities. We will have only the efficient ones.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Self_Improvement_versus_Effectivity\">Self Improvement versus Effectivity</h2>\n<p>It is commonly held among EAs that self-improvement is the route to being a maximally powerful individual, which then means becoming a maximally causally powerful individual so you can do your Max altruistic good. A lot of people's time goes to self-improvement.</p>\n<p>Outreach and getting others to do work are neglected because of that, in my opinion. Working on self-improvement can be tremendously useful, but some people use it to enter a cocoon from which they believe they will emerge butterflies long later. They may even be right, but long later may be too late for their altruism.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Does_not_this_argument_hold__at_any_point_in_time__for_the_next_two_years_\">Does not this argument hold, at any point in time, for the next two years?</h2>\n<p>Yes. Unless you are say, going to finish college in two years, or repaying a debt so you can work on the FAI team three years from now, or something very unusual, most of your power involves contacting the right people now, having ideas now, and getting people as good as you to join your cause now. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Recently I watched a GWWC pledge event, where expected \u00a0one million dollars were raised in future expected earnings. This was the result of a class on Altruism given to undergrads in Berkeley (hooray Ajea and Oliver by the way). You can probably get someone to teach a course on EA, or do it yourself now etc... and then all the consequences of those people turning into EAs now versus in five years, or for some people never, are on you.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"If_it_holds_at_any_time__does_it_make_sense_\">If it holds at any time, does it make sense?</h2>\n<p>Of course it does. What Singer did in 1972 has influenced us all more than anything he could do now. But he is alive now, he can't change the past, and he is doing <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Most-Good-You-Can/dp/0300180276\">his best</a> with the next two years.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The same is true of you now. In fact, if you have a budget of resources to allocate to effective altruism, I suggest you go all in during the next two years (or one year, if you like moving fast). Your time will never be worth the same amount of Altruistic Utilons after that. For some of us, I believe that there will be a crossover point, a point at which your actions are mattering less than how much you want to dedicate effort to them, this is your EA-retirement day. This depends on which other values you have besides EA and how old you are.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But the next two years are going to be very important, and to start acting on them now, and going all in, seems to me like an extremely reasonable strategy to adopt even if you have a limited number of total hours or effort you intend to allocate to EA. If you made a pledge to donate 10% of your time for instance, donate the first 10% you can get a hold of.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Exceptions\">Exceptions</h2>\n<p>Many occasions are candidate exceptions for this \"bienial all-in\" policy I'm suggesting. Before the end of Death was fathomable, it would be a bad idea to spend two years fighting it, as Bostrom suggests in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLecJrXpOEU\">the fable</a>. If you will finish some particularly important project that will enable you to do incredible things in two years, but it won't matter that much how well as long as you do it (say you will get a law degree in two years) then maybe hold your breadth. If you are an AI researcher who thinks the most important years for AI will be between 10 and 20 years from now, it may not be your time to go all in yet. There are many other cases.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But for everyone else, the next two years will be the most important future two years you will ever get to have as an active altruist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Make the best of them!\u00a0</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "9th Mar 2015", "title": "The economy of weirdness", "author": "Katja_Grace", "num_comments": "7 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>It is\u00a0<a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/bg/you_have_a_set_amount_of_weirdness_points_spend/\">often</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/01/dear-young-eccentric.html\">said</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncrasy_credit\">that</a>\u00a0you should spend your weirdness budget\u00a0wisely.\u00a0You should wear a gender-appropriate suit, and follow culture-appropriate sports, and\u00a0use good grammar, and be\u00a0non-specifically\u00a0spiritual, and\u00a0support moderate policies, and not have any tattoos around either of your eyes. And\u00a0then on the odd occasion, when\u00a0it happens to come up, you should gather up\u00a0your entire weirdness budget\u00a0and make a\u00a0short, impassioned speech in favor of invertebrate equality. Or whatever you think is the\u00a0very most\u00a0effective use of\u00a0weirdness. In short: you only get so much weirdness, so\u00a0don't\u00a0use it up\u00a0dressing like a clown or popularizing alternative sleep schedules.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While I agree the oddball\u00a0activist will often\u00a0get less airtime than her unassuming\u00a0analog, and\u00a0that weirdness is\u00a0often\u00a0a cost, the issue seems more\u00a0complex. Let us\u00a0better explore\u00a0weirdness budgeting.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Model__1__Weirdness_is_badness\">Model #1: Weirdness is\u00a0badness</strong></p>\n<p>A first\u00a0simple\u00a0model is that\u00a0people don't like weird things, so if you have any, they will like you less in expectation. Weirdness is a kind of badness.\u00a0On this model, I suppose the reason you would want to be weird at all is that you just are weird, and it is hard or unpleasant to keep\u00a0it under control.</p>\n<p>Some characteristics are certainly\u00a0like this. For instance, being\u00a0shockingly unable to open corkscrews, or tending to\u00a0fart really loudly. These are just bad characteristics\u00a0though, and don't seem like they need to be budgeted differently from other bad\u00a0but not weird characteristics, like being lazy and stupid. I don't think\u00a0this is what people have in mind when they say to spend your weirdness budget wisely.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Model__2__Weirdness_is_rarity_is_bad\">Model #2:\u00a0Weirdness is rarity is bad</strong></p>\n<p>Here is a closely related model. Weird traits are not\u00a0inherently bad, but they are inherently unusual, and being unusual is inherently bad.\u00a0On this model, the reason you want to have a weird trait\u00a0could\u00a0be\u00a0that you like the trait, and\u00a0so you want to make it less unusual.</p>\n<p>If many people feel that way, then on\u00a0this model,\u00a0weird traits are\u00a0tragedies of the commons. e.g. If everyone could be naked in the street, the world would be a better place for everyone. But sadly, because\u00a0nobody does it, anyone who starts is socially punished. So it is\u00a0only the very\u00a0altruistic person\u00a0who\u00a0will\u00a0pull off\u00a0their pants and\u00a0be ostracized\u00a0for the common good.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Model__3__Weirdness_among_the_cool_kids_is_bad\">Model #3: Weirdness among the cool kids is bad</strong></p>\n<p>This is like the last model, but explains why you would want to budget your weirdness. In it, it doesn't matter how common a trait is, it matters how common it is among cool people (or perhaps how differentially common it is among cool people).\u00a0So then you\u00a0don't want to help popularize too many weird traits, because the more weird traits you have the\u00a0less cool you seem, and thus the less\u00a0your vote in favor of those traits counts.</p>\n<p>I think there is a hint of truth to these models so far. Kinds of unusualness are inherently bad, unusualness is often bad, and having traits\u00a0makes those traits\u00a0less unusual among people like you. However\u00a0I highly doubt that people are mostly weird out of\u00a0altruism, or even altruism combined with inability to control their weirdness. People love\u00a0being weird. (Often.)</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Model__4__Weirdness_is_divisive\">Model #4: Weirdness\u00a0is\u00a0divisive</strong></p>\n<p>Some weird traits are unambiguously bad. Some are unambiguously good, and empirically, these don't appear to use up weirdness budget.\u00a0If you are weirdly hilarious\u00a0this\u00a0probably means you can get away with more other weirdness, not less.</p>\n<p>Many traits a bit good and a bit bad: they please\u00a0some people while scaring off others. If a trait is 'weird', probably it displeases most\u00a0people, and appeals to few. But this\u00a0isn't necessarily a bad deal, even from a selfish perspective.</p>\n<p>For one thing,\u00a0it might please the few a lot. Being into\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Heaven\">15th Century\u00a0East Asian\u00a0architecture</a>\u00a0will\u00a0seem\u00a0merely not that interesting\u00a0to the vast majority of people, while exceptionally exciting to the few\u00a0who share your interest.</p>\n<p>For another thing, it matters how much you care about different levels of\u00a0liking. For many circumstances, the big value is in having\u00a0everyone think you are basically ok.\u00a0If you are widely considered basically ok, you can be trusted\u00a0on routine issues, you can have a job, you can have friends, you can\u00a0be taken seriously. If you are basically ok and have one weird opinion, you can be a datapoint suggesting that weird opinion is ok for basically ok people\u00a0to have.\u00a0</p>\n<p>However if you want people to\u00a0buy your book, or change continents\u00a0to live with you, or fund\u00a0your experimental research organization, then you need some people to\u00a0<em>really</em>\u00a0like you. But\u00a0luckily, you don't need that many. And when\u00a0the bar is high, and you only need to meet it a few times, you want high variance. If\u00a0you can pick up a trait that\u00a090% of the population dislikes, but the remainder likes, you\u00a0might\u00a0take\u00a0it.\u00a0Because ten percent of people liking you can be way better than\u00a0everyone being indifferent.\u00a0And then you might do it again, and again. Until eventually,\u00a0you marry the last person and ignore the rest.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are also traits that 60% of people are indifferent to, and 40% of people love, and these are a better deal, and you should start there, all things equal. But there are many other reasons to have\u00a0particular traits, e.g. you already have them, and it would be effort to hide or destroy them. Generally, it\u00a0is\u00a0easy for a trait you want to have for other reasons to be\u00a0positive value on social grounds in spite of being weird and seeming bad to many people.</p>\n<p>Causes and policy views tend to fit in this 'divisive' category. If you\u00a0advocate for abolishing the minimum wage, some people\u00a0will love you more, and some people will hate you more. Causes are often political, which means that which people like you more and which people\u00a0hate you more is correlated between them. This would make\u00a0spending a bunch of weirdness an\u00a0even better deal. Once you have advocated for abolishing the minimum wage, if you mostly care about some people liking you a lot, you may as well\u00a0go on to support a slew of other free market policies,\u00a0because the same people as liked you the first time will like you more, instead of\u00a0you losing half of them at every step.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Model__4_1__Weirdness_is_divisive__the_goal_is_spreading_weird_traits\">Model\u00a0#4.1: Weirdness is divisive, the goal is spreading weird traits</strong></p>\n<p>So far we assumed you wanted to be liked or taken seriously a certain amount by other people. What if we suppose you have a set of weird traits you are in favor of, which you may choose to express or not, and\u00a0your primary goal is to spread\u00a0them? (As described in\u00a0#2). For instance, suppose you\u00a0care\u00a0a lot\u00a0about animal suffering, and also the far future, and think cryonics should be much more common, and think public displays of affection\u00a0should be\u00a0normal, and that polyphasic sleep is a thing everyone should try.</p>\n<p>As described in\u00a0#4, variance gets you\u00a0smaller numbers of\u00a0people who\u00a0feel more positively toward you, and sometimes this is worth it. For instance, if nobody will take any of your ideas seriously unless they think you are incredibly impressive. There are a couple of important features specific to the\u00a0ambition of spreading weird traits\u00a0however.</p>\n<p>One is that\u00a0to spread a weird trait, you generally\u00a0have to have it, or associate yourself with it somehow. That potentially makes expressing more of your traits better,\u00a0aside from its effect on how\u00a0well respected or liked you are.\u00a0Suppose\u00a0you want people to agree with you on\u00a0cryonics and the far future.\u00a0Then even if talking about\u00a0both topics\u00a0reduces\u00a0much people are willing to listen to you, it might be worth it\u00a0because now your small remaining group of admirers think about\u00a0twice as many\u00a0topics you want them to think about.\u00a0This assumes\u00a0they\u00a0don't just reduce their attention to your first topic proportionally.</p>\n<p>Note that the incentives here are different for narrowly directed\u00a0advocacy organizations\u00a0and their members.\u00a0You might do best advocating for whales and bad haircuts, but your whale organization would strongly prefer you just stick to the whales.</p>\n<p>Another feature of the divisiveness model when you care about spreading\u00a0traits\u00a0is that people disliking\u00a0you has particularly negative effects when you are trying to spread\u00a0traits.\u00a0Often, causing half of humanity\u00a0to mildly dislike you is\u00a0not so bad, because it will just mean you don't interact with them on a personal basis much, and you weren't that socially ambitious\u00a0anyway. However\u00a0when\u00a0people\u00a0dislike\u00a0you they will often associate your particular traits with dislike.\u00a0It might still be worth trading some people disliking you for others liking you extra, but this consideration makes such trades worse than they would have been.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Model__5__Weirdness_is_local\">Model #5: Weirdness is local</strong></p>\n<p>It could be that most of what matters is weirdness relative to those around\u00a0you, and that different groups find different things weird, and that you can change who is around you.\u00a0This picture seems true for some kinds of traits, such as a weird sense of humor.\u00a0In this case, you\u00a0can either explicitly search for your people, or just act as you\u00a0want to in the long run,\u00a0scare\u00a0away\u00a0those who\u00a0find it weird, and\u00a0be left with a suitable\u00a0group. In this model,\u00a0being weird in a\u00a0specific\u00a0way has\u00a0a one-time (though perhaps large and drawn out) cost, and then you can do it for free, forever. So\u00a0in this model\u00a0the wisest way to spend your so-called weirdness budget might be\u00a0fast and completely.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Model__6_Weirdness_as_a_signal\">Model #6 Weirdness as a signal</strong></p>\n<p>If weirdness is just a generic bad sign, or is a sign that you match with some groups of people or others, earlier models will perhaps\u00a0suffice. But being weird often\u00a0suggests other specific things about a person.</p>\n<p>As\u00a0soon as being weird is probably a bad option, then it also becomes\u00a0a sign\u00a0of lack of awareness, or\u00a0self-control.\u00a0For instance, if someone wears a ripped\u00a0shirt to a job interview, one probably\u00a0infers that they are clueless about customs, don't own a nice shirt, or that have some other mysterious\u00a0agenda that one probably\u00a0doesn't want to be involved with.\u00a0These kind of signals\u00a0lead to the basic situation\u00a0described in model 2,\u00a0where things are not intrinsically bad become so\u00a0by\u00a0virtue of being weird. However this means that you can be more\u00a0weird in certain ways without using up weirdness budget\u00a0if you counteract\u00a0the signaling\u00a0on its own.\u00a0For instance, if you\u00a0enter a job interview and say 'I'm sorry\u00a0that my shirt is torn\u2014I actually\u00a0got it caught on a shrubbery on my way in here', then the interviewer will no longer infer \u00a0that you don't know about social customs, though may infer that you were interacting unusually with a\u00a0shrubbery.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Model__7__Weirdness_is_honest\">Model #7: Weirdness is\u00a0honest</strong></p>\n<p>The usual consequence of advice to\u00a0be thrifty\u00a0with weirdness is that people end up with\u00a0a\u00a0collection\u00a0of views and interests that they keep hidden from the world.\u00a0Sometimes this\u00a0might be actively deceptive, for instance\u00a0when\u00a0people with\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html\">unspeakable views</a>\u00a0claim to have no views. But\u00a0mostly avoiding being weird is just implicit misrepresentation.\u00a0This suggests\u00a0a range\u00a0of considerations associated with honesty in general. Honesty has virtues and costs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The costs of honesty as they apply here are I think mostly covered above\u2014if you have\u00a0traits that are widely acknowledged as bad, or make you seem like someone you don't want to be seen as, or whatever, it is costly to\u00a0let them\u00a0be seen.\u00a0I think there are some\u00a0benefits of honesty that haven't fit under other above models\u00a0however.</p>\n<p>It's more interesting to\u00a0know about a relatively complete, 'authentic' person than a flat, disconnected one-issue front that an unknown person\u00a0has\u00a0chosen\u00a0to erect. People are usually interested in hearing about people more than ideas, so if you present yourself as a person this will probably interest them more. And a person generally has an array of idiosyncrasies\u00a0and unusual concerns, including some that are not the most effective thing to be concerned about, and some characteristics that everyone agrees are actively bad.</p>\n<p>Relatedly, revealing\u00a0a relatively\u00a0full array of your views and interests\u00a0means people know\u00a0you better, which tends to\u00a0improve your\u00a0relationship with them. I'd guess this is true even for people who observe you from far away on the internet.\u00a0I think I feel\u00a0more sympathetic to an author\u00a0who admits they have characteristics beyond an interest in the subject matter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another virtue of honesty is that if people see the\u00a0larger picture behind the particular\u00a0view you are espousing, your behavior will make more sense, so you will seem more reasonable and interesting. For instance, if you advocate for developing world aid for a while, and then suddenly\u00a0change to advocating for space travel, you might seem flakey. Whereas if you say all along that you care about doing the most cost-effective thing, and are open minded about causes, and are considering a bunch of them on an ongoing basis,\u00a0and explain why you think these different causes are cost-effective,\u00a0then this might\u00a0seem consistent instead of actively inconsistent.\u00a0Relatedly, as your views evolve\u00a0it seems\u00a0more natural for those who were interested before to remain interested if they\u00a0understand the bigger picture of your\u00a0motives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Relatedly, particular weird views will often make more sense in the\u00a0context of\u00a0your larger set of\u00a0weird\u00a0views. If you espouse cryonics on its own, and don't mention that you also think\u00a0it will be possible to upload human minds\u00a0onto computers,\u00a0the cryonics will seem much more ambitious than it otherwise would.</p>\n<p>Then there is just the\u00a0usual problem that dishonesty is confusing and\u00a0tangly. Views on some topics strongly suggest views on other topics, so\u00a0if\u00a0topics are out of bounds, you have to make sure you don't imply anything about them. This is probably much easier in practice than it first seems, because\u00a0people are\u00a0not\u00a0great\u00a0at drawing inferences.\u00a0I wouldn't be surprised if using\u00a0abstract language\u00a0was\u00a0enough to successfully hide\u00a0most controversial statements most of the time. However there\u00a0are probably\u00a0other things like this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you tell people what you really care about, you can have more useful conversations with them, because they can give\u00a0feedback and\u00a0suggestions that actually matter to you. For instance, if\u00a0I spend\u00a0most\u00a0of my time thinking about how to improve my life, but I write as if all I care about is resolving puzzles in social science, then your comments can only\u00a0help me with puzzles in social science.</p>\n<p>It can feel better to be honest. However this might just be down to better relationships and avoiding the mental taxation associated with maintaining an inoffensive front.</p>\n<p>This is not an exhaustive account of the virtues of\u00a0weirdness as honesty. Also note that none of the benefits\u00a0I mentioned apply strongly all of the time. They are just considerations that sometimes matter, and sometimes\u00a0make it better\u00a0to\u00a0be pretty\u00a0weird.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Ok, those are all of my\u00a0models of weirdness for now, and of how it is appropriate to splurge/invest in it. I suspect\u00a0at least many of them\u00a0have some truth, and apply to varying degrees\u00a0to\u00a0various weirdnesses in varying parts of the real world.\u00a0There\u00a0are probably other important dynamics I have missed. Overall, I'm still not sure how weird it is good to be in general. It seems plausible that\u00a0many people\u00a0should\u00a0be\u00a0relatively weird across the board, rather than saving it all up for one issue.\u00a0I suspect some people\u00a0are best off being\u00a0weird\u00a0while others\u00a0should be more\u00a0normal\u00a0overall, and it is harder to tell\u00a0what is best on the current margin, where some people are weird and some are normal. My guess is that\u00a0you should often\u00a0treat weirdness\u00a0differently depending on what you want to achieve (basic respectability? Fame? A boyfriend? A good relationship with your audience? A good relationship with your\u00a0organization?),\u00a0and\u00a0the nature of the weirdness in question (How much do\u00a0some people like it? How much do others not? Does it send specific signals? Is it just bad?).\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Also posted at <a href=\"https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2015/03/08/the-economy-of-weirdness/\">Meteuphoric</a></em></p></div></div>"},

{"date": "13th Sep 2015", "title": "Might wireheaders turn into paperclippers?", "author": "Lila", "num_comments": "13 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><h1 id=\"Morally_valuable_post_human_futures_\">Morally valuable post-human futures?</h1>\n<p>Effective altruism's expanding circle of moral concern has become wide enough, for many people, to include \u201cpost-humans\u201d: beings that may become the dominant agents of the future, rendering human experience as we know it negligible or nonexistent in comparison. These beings may be biological, computational, or a mixture of the two. In this category I include transhumanist scenarios, such as human enhancement and <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Wireheading\">wireheading</a>, certain simulations, and <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2012/03/are-pain-and-pleasure-equally-energy.html\">hedonium</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the most part, these scenarios are viewed as highly net positive by some EAs. In fact, some people believe that these possible futures should be a goal of effective altruism and existential risk reduction. For example, in one argument for why people should care about existential risk, Nick Bostrom <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html\">imagines</a> a galactic supercluster being entirely converted into computers that would simulate happy human minds. A 1% chance of speeding this scenario by one second, he says, would bring astronomical utility. Of course, this <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Pascal's_mugging\">Pascal's-mugging-like</a> argument is not the main argument for existential risk reduction, and I don't intend to straw-man existential risk researchers. However, these post-human fantasies are popular enough in the EA community that they are worth addressing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The typical objection to pursuing post-human fantasies is the possibility of post-human nightmares: universes that contain astronomical suffering. These arguments have been well-discussed by other people. However, there is a third option that has been largely ignored: what if post-humans have neither positive nor negative moral value?</p>\n<h1 id=\"Reward_functions_we_don_t_care_about\">Reward functions we don't care about</h1>\n<p><span>How do we know if a post-human is happy? This may be very difficult if the post-human bears little similarity to us, because we wouldn't be able to ask it about its internal experience in a way that would provide a trustworthy answer, much less identify neurotransmitters or brainwaves of value. Some might approximate happiness as the post-human's reward function, which can be either satisfied or unsatisfied. By this definition, a <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer\">paperclipper</a> would be capable of pain and pleasure, because it has a reward function that's satisfied when it produces paperclips. However, few people would view a universe full of paperclips as astronomically net positive, even though the paperclipper would be \u201chappy\u201d. If you believe that the paperclipper scenario would be very good, consider an even simpler reward function and ask yourself if you still care about it. For example, imagine an electrical switch with two positions: one labeled \u201cpleasure\u201d and one labeled \u201cpain\u201d. Would this system be algedonic in a way we'd care about?</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thus, it seems insufficient to maximize reward functions to maximize positive value.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Solutions\">Solutions</h1>\n<p>My best solution to the <em>reductio ad absurdum </em><span>of valuing paperclippers is to </span><span>base my moral system on human experience as we know it</span><span>. The experiences of animals and other entities are valuable to me insofar as they are similar to human experience </span><span>(see </span><span>following sections</span><span>)</span><span>.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>I still care about existential risk because of the value of future human generations, but the moral case </span><span>feels</span><span> less overwhelming </span><span>than I previously believed</span><span>, because I don't value many possible post-human futures.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>While I don't object to mild forms of human enhancement </span><em>per se</em><span>, I am concerned that any post-humans would face selective pressures to become less like humans and more like paperclippers. Certain technological leaps would be irreversible and would send us hurtling toward futures </span><span>that have little relationship to human values</span><span>. I believe that MIRI shares these concerns in regards to AI but hasn't extended concern to the </span><span>other </span><span>post-human scenarios I listed, which are widely viewed as positive. </span><span>Some AI researchers have suggested putting </span><span>restrictions</span><span> on certain types of AI research, </span><span>a policy which </span><span>I may want</span><span> </span><span>applied to </span><span>other technological developments as well. </span><span>At the very least, I would avoid actively </span><span>endorsing or pursuing </span><span>the creation of post-humans</span><span>.</span></p>\n<h1 id=\"Speculation\"><span>S</span><span>peculation</span></h1>\n<p>Note: I'm not very confident in the following, and it's less important to my major concerns about post-humans.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Consciousness_as__similarity_to_one_s_own_mind_\">Consciousness as \u201csimilarity to one's own mind\u201d</h2>\n<p>I'm not confident that the hard problem of consciousness can be answered empirically. Thus, I find a more tractable question is, \u201cWhat do people mean when they say 'consciousness'?\u201d Top-down definitions of consciousness (e.g. \u201ccomplexity\u201d or \u201cintegration\u201d) seem to miss the point. We can always come up with systems that meet these definitions of consciousness but don't fit our intuitions of consciousness. For example, some have speculated that corporations may be conscious, but I think that few people would be willing to accept this conclusion. So what if we skipped the pretense and started with the intuitions, instead of trying to stretch definitions to fit our intuitions? Many people seem to have the following intuitions: humans are certainly conscious, animals are less conscious (and their consciousness decreases as their similarity to humans decreases), plants are not conscious, computers are only conscious if they behave similarly to human cognitive processes (e.g. by simulating human brains).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Defining consciousness as similarity to one's own mind captures many of these intuitions, though it leads to some unpleasant conclusions. For example, it would lead to some degree of moral egotism. Additionally, from this perspective, I would view someone in Sub-Saharan Africa as less conscious than a fellow American. I'm very reluctant to accept these conclusions. One consolation is that the effects of this egotism would be negligible, since most humans are very similar to me. Also, these bullets are easier to bite than some others, such as conscious corporations. Finally, these conclusions are somewhat in line with \u201ccommon-sense\u201d ethics, which accepts slight egotism and strong kin preference.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Furthermore, egotism is implicitly central to discussions of consciousness. Thought experiments about qualia are about one's <em>personal experience</em><span> with, </span><span>for example, the color red</span><span>. When we ask, \u201cWhat is it like to be a bat?\u201d, we are asking \u201cWhat is it like </span><em>for me</em><span> to be a bat?\u201d</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"The_spectrum_of_personal_identity\">The spectrum of personal identity</h2>\n<p>The problem of personal identity has been frequently discussed in the philosophical literature. If I'm constantly changing, down to the cellular level, then, like the ship of Theseus, how can I maintain a constant personal identity? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_individualism\">Open individualism</a> rejects the idea of personal identity entirely and asserts that all consciousness is one. This seems too vague to me. Instead, I view personal identity as a spectrum, based on similarity to my current self. The self of five minutes ago is more \u201cme\u201d than the self of five years ago, who is more \u201cme\u201d than Mike, a middle-aged Republican farmer in Iowa. Mike is far more \u201cme\u201d than Mike's chicken.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Changing_the_status_quo_is_death\">Changing the status quo is death</h2>\n<p><span>Transhumanists note status quo bias in common objections to human enhancement: people are reluctant to accept changes to themselves or their societies, even if these changes appear objectively better. However, to some degree this bias can be viewed as rational. If I were to become Mike and lose all trace of my previous self, I would view this as almost as bad as death, even though Mike is happy. Of course, there are tradeoffs between self-improvement and status quo preservation. I don't want to retain all features of my current mind for the rest of my life, but I'm sufficiently concerned about small deaths of my personal identity that I avoid long-term mind-altering substances. \u00a0</span></p></div></div>"},

How can we reach interesting groups about which we know little or which are hard to find out about, such as people on the fringes of effective altruism, or people who favour effective poverty charities but haven't heard of EA? Where should we share the survey and to whom should we send it? Is it worth selecting and targeting an initial sample before trying to reach as many people as possible? (Though we've already asked Greg Lewis for suggestions on this and are planning to follow them after lengthy internal and external discussion.)

{"date": "14th May 2015", "title": "Dissociation for Altruists", "author": "Denis Drescher", "num_comments": "11 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>Some people do not lack in altruism and are well aware of  effectiveness considerations too, but the sheer magnitude of suffering  that effective interventions would force them to face is too unbearable  for them to acknowledge. I give tips on how they can use dissociation to  put altruism on a more scalable\u00a0basis. (<a href=\"http://claviger.net/dissociation-for-altruists.html\">Cross-posted from my blog.</a>)<br></em></p>\n<p>Books like Peter Singer\u2019s <em>The Life You Can Save</em> mostly  aim to break through people\u2019s compartmentalization to allow them a  glimpse of the real importance of problems like poverty. This is one of  the most common outreach strategies and it may also be the most widely  applicable one. Some of you, however, may be well aware of the  importance of the enterprise but are too sensitive to face the suffering  that the most effective interventions necessarily bring to\u00a0mind.</p>\n<p>Repeatedly I\u2019ve heard that people think effective altruism is great,  but that they would become emotional wrecks if they allowed themselves  to care about more than the well-being of their closest friends,  Wikipedia, and <span>SETI</span>@home.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been there. The suffering in the world is enormous, and all the  while even the suffering of a single chicken in industrial agriculture  is unfathomable to me. I watched a video of seals being flayed alive  once. For weeks I slipped through the world in a\u00a0haze.</p>\n<p>However, when we want to donate time and money to alleviate this  suffering effectively, then we have to acknowledge it. My solution to  overcome this \u201csqueamishness\u201d has been to not \u201cfeel about\u201d the things I  think about, a form of dissociation. It was more a decision for me than  something I had to train, but if it doesn\u2019t come easy to you, then I\u2019ve  collected some tips for you as well. (Peter Singer touches on this in  chapter 7, \u201cIs Love all We Need?,\u201d of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Most-Good-You-Can-Effective/dp/0300180276/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431534189&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+most+good+you+can+do&amp;tag=s4charity-20\"><em>The Most Good You Can Do</em></a>.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"Permitting_Yourself_to_Dissociate\">Permitting Yourself to\u00a0Dissociate</h2>\n<p>When I still thought that it was virtuous to empathize emotionally, I did a version of <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/l30/on_caring/\">Nate Soares\u2019s experiment</a> where, time and time again, I invented an individual family to  represent the statistical victims of poverty and disease that I knew  about. Thus I tried to prove to myself that my brain was not a cold dead  place. I was overwhelmed and paralyzed with their suffering. I hadn\u2019t  even started to imagine the ten-fold suffering of ten families or the  ten million\u2013fold suffering of ten million families, yet my  \u201ccare-o-meter,\u201d as Nate calls it, was maxed out already. As these  emotions preoccupied me and weighed me down, my productivity suffered  and it threatened to impact, among other things, my\u00a0fundraising.</p>\n<p>Consequentialism saved me. Empathy doesn\u2019t have to take the form that  lets you break down sobbing and clawing the floor, or whatever it looks  like for you. In fact our recent advances in transport and  communication mean that we need a more advanced form of empathy too. <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/l30/on_caring/\">As Nate puts it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Prominent altruists aren\u2019t the people who have a larger care-o-meter, they\u2019re the people who have <em>learned not to trust their care-o-meters.</em> Our care-o-meters are broken. They don\u2019t work on large numbers. Nobody  has one capable of faithfully representing the scope of the world\u2019s  problems. But the fact that you can\u2019t <em>feel</em> the caring doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t <em>do</em> the caring. \u2026 You can still <em>act</em> like the world\u2019s problems are as big as they are. You can stop trusting  the internal feelings to guide your actions and switch over to  manual\u00a0control.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The realization that there\u2019s nothing virtuous about having these  emotions, that all I was doing was trying to electrocute myself with a  broken voltmeter, freed me and allowed me to get stuff done\u00a0again.</p>\n<p>Medical students have to learn that too. One of them <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/2aiyai/doctorssurgeons_of_reddit_are_you_squeamish/ciwai6t\">told themselves</a> \u201cif I don\u2019t dissociate myself from this patient\u2019s pain, then I will not  be able to take care of them the way I need to.\u201d Intellectualizing this  decision repeatedly in a small pep talk before each surgery helped them  shut it off, and only that way they were able to perform as highly as  possible. As Nate puts it\u00a0again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s a common trope that courage isn\u2019t about being fearless, it\u2019s about being afraid but <em>doing the right thing anyway.</em> In the same sense, caring about the world isn\u2019t about having a gut  feeling that corresponds to the amount of suffering in the world, it\u2019s  about <em>doing the right thing anyway.</em> Even without the feeling. [Especially without the\u00a0feeling.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There may be other hurdles for you, as there were for\u00a0me:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you\u2019re worried that your altruism may be selfishly motivated,  then that\u2019s just fine so long as it helps the beneficiaries as much as  differently motivated forms of altruism\u00a0would.</li>\n<li>If you\u2019re worried that this supposed nonaltruistic motivation may be  less lasting than extreme poverty, then put some effort into getting  all your finances organized and then <a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/\">file a pledge</a>. A \u201cfurther\u201d pledge may even be less risky if you anticipate periods of low\u00a0income.</li>\n<li>Finally, sabotage your supposed motivation. Today the selfish  motivation I used to suspect seems absurd to me. It ceased to apply at  some point, and my enthusiasm for <span>EA</span> was as great as ever. Q.e.d.,\u00a0fscker!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And in case you\u2019re worried, I don\u2019t think that practicing  dissociation has impacted my social abilities in any way. On the  contrary, I\u2019ve become able to talk about things that used to be so  emotional I hardly dared to think about them\u00a0before.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Dissociation_Tips\">Dissociation\u00a0Tips</h2>\n<p>For me, not feeling was mostly a choice, but there are some precautions I make anyway and some more tips I\u2019ve gleaned from\u00a0MDs.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get the tools from the abstraction toolbox. It helps to think in  terms of DALYs and funding gaps when you read a statistic. That way you  can think about it without automatically imagining what it means for the  beings it\u00a0describes.</li>\n<li>If it makes you feel safer, imagine, just once, a unit of suffering  that you can envision without going to pieces, like a nonfatal episode  of malaria, to understand what a sixth of a <span>DALY</span> means. Once you\u2019ve thus anchored the unit, you can stop thinking about  the thing itself altogether and only operate with the\u00a0abstraction.</li>\n<li>Avoid images and videos unless you\u2019re sure you can dissociate sufficiently. Academic prose is\u00a0safer.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t visit the countries where you\u2019re helping. There is great value  in understanding the local conditions better to run better  interventions, but the top charities and GiveWell are doing that already  so you don\u2019t have\u00a0to.</li>\n<li>Related to that, try not to get to know anyone you might be helping.  The decision to donate someplace and not someplace else may consign  some to death so others (and hopefully more) can live. It helps to not  know either to make better\u00a0decisions.</li>\n<li>A common technique is to create a clear donation budget so that you  only have to think about these issues in depth once or a couple times  per\u00a0year.</li>\n<li>Donating to a trust like GiveWell\u2019s or Giving What We Can\u2019s might also help increase the\u00a0abstraction.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_-Rsy4xMONwJ:www.medscape.com/viewarticle/714098+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk\">Sara Cohen</a>, <span>MD</span>,  recommends distraction in addition to dissociation: \u201cWhen I started  feeling queasy, I did a simple trick: I counted to 10. Deep  breath,\u00a01-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10.\u201d</li>\n<li>Another one of her strategies is to desensitize herself, which she  did in a controlled, low-risk fashion with videos. When you feel up for  it, you can try that too,\u00a0carefully.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sara Cohen concludes somewhat self-contradictorily that \u201clike my own  advisors, I can now assert that it\u2019s true that everyone eventually gets  over it. And if not, there\u2019s always radiology.\u201d There may be some  selection bias involved here (due to medical students who can\u2019t  dissociate sufficiently changing degrees), and many surgeons also  indicate that there are still certain procedures that they can\u2019t  perform. But even these surgeons have surely made great progress since  their first semesters of medical school, and the combination of  dissociation and avoidance that they practice works well for them and  can surely also work well for\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>If you have any more of such tips to share, please do so in the  comments. I can\u2019t give comprehensive answers that\u2019ll work for everyone,  but I hope I can start a discussion that will generate more of them for  more of\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve taken this hurdle, articles like Ben Kuhn\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/stress\">To Stressed-Out Altruists</a>\u201d and Lukas Gloor\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/gv/room_for_other_things_how_to_adjust_if_ea_seems/\">Room for Other Things</a>\u201d may become helpful to make your impact even more\u00a0sustainable.</p></div></div>"},

Wenar\u2019s essay \u201c<a href=\"http://wenar.info/WenarPovertyNoPond8-09.pdf\">Poverty Is No Pond</a>\u201d \u2013 especially to those not yet familiar with, but interested in, the empirical complexities involved in giving to overseas poverty-fighting charities.\u00a0 Wenar\u2019s main aim in his essay is to criticize Peter Singer\u2019s 2009 book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-You-Can-Save/dp/0812981561\">The Life You Can Save</a></em> for (i) being overly optimistic about the quality of information available on the effects of giving to various charities, and (ii) failing to emphasize that every charitable donation also comes with some risk of harming people living in extreme poverty.\u00a0 I\u2019ll only briefly address (i), and then turn to and focus primarily on (ii).</p>\n<p>(i)\u00a0 Wenar raises a number of very good points about the difficulties of assessing the effectiveness of government and NGO (non-governmental organization) aid directed toward people living in extreme poverty.\u00a0 He does not confine himself to a single type of aid, e.g. development or humanitarian aid, but calls our attention to important challenges facing a wide range of aid categories.\u00a0 I do think, however, that it is reasonable to be optimistic about the quality of information available on many health interventions, particularly the ones studied in detail by the <a href=\"http://www.dcp-3.org/\">Disease Control Priorities Project</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/en/\">World Health Organization</a>.\u00a0 Wenar would probably also be pleased by how far <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> has developed in the five years since he wrote his essay, and by the convergence between them and <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> on the tremendous cost-effectiveness of deworming and providing malaria nets (both charity evaluators very highly rank <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/Default.aspx\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto\">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.evidenceaction.org/#deworm-the-world\">Deworm the World</a>).\u00a0 Wenar is right that it is difficult to know how much it costs to save a life by donating to, e.g. Against Malaria Foundation, because there is uncertainty about what would have happened had the donation not been made.\u00a0 But charity evaluators like those mentioned above take counterfactuals and uncertainty into account and would agree that we can at best provide rough ranges rather than exact figures, for how much it costs to save a life.\u00a0 Wenar writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThere are presently few paths or incentives for NGOs to translate academic studies into changed behavior. \u00a0External audits on aid NGOs cover only the basics of financial probity, without touching on the results of the NGOs\u2019 projects.\u201d\u00a0 (p. 20)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But this doesn\u2019t accurately reflect, for example, the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/process\">in-depth process</a> that GiveWell uses in evaluating charities.\u00a0 Moreover, now there is a new breed of NGOs that are very focused on transparency and accountability; in addition to Against Malaria Foundation and Deworm the World, consider <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a> and <a href=\"http://possiblehealth.org/\">Possible</a> (there are still several others).\u00a0 Because of <a href=\"https://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">effective altruist</a> organizations like GiveWell, Giving What We Can, and <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\">The Life You Can Save (Singer\u2019s book spawned an organization)</a>, these NGOs do have an incentive to continue down this path, and others to follow their lead.\u00a0 (As one example, endorsements from these charity evaluators feature prominently on <a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/Users/tgpum_000/Desktop/againstmalaria.com\">the Against Malaria Foundation website</a>.)</p>\n<p>(ii)\u00a0 I find Wenar\u2019s criticism that Singer\u2019s framework does not take account of risk of harming others to be the most philosophically interesting aspect of his essay.\u00a0 I\u2019ll briefly remind the reader of Singer\u2019s general framework, and then present and discuss Wenar\u2019s criticism.\u00a0 In <a href=\"http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Singeressayspring1972.pdf\">his 1972 article</a>, Singer offered the following principle:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIf it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything morally significant, we ought, morally, to do it.\u201d\u00a0 (p. 231)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then gave the famous pond example, eliciting a powerful and widely shared intuition that plausibly supports the above principle:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201c[I]f I am walking past a shallow pond and see a child drowning in it, I ought to wade in and pull the child out. \u00a0This will mean getting my clothes muddy, but this is insignificant, while the death of the child would presumably be a very bad thing.\u201d\u00a0 (p. 231)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, Singer noted that poverty-related death and suffering are bad things, and that we can prevent them from happening without sacrificing anything morally significant by donating to effective aid agencies.\u00a0 The conclusion is that we ought, morally, to donate to effective aid agencies.</p>\n<p>Wenar\u2019s criticism of this Singer framework is that (Wenar claims) it doesn\u2019t take into account the fact that our donations invariably come with a risk of harm to others, particularly those living in extreme poverty. \u00a0He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cSinger\u2019s principle does not capture the correct factual relationship between affluent and poor individuals. \u00a0So this principle does not capture the moral relationship between them, and it cannot ground a call to action. \u00a0You are not in a situation analogous to knowing that you can save a child drowning in a shallow pond. \u00a0Closer is this: \u00a0if you hand cash to a stranger he may \u2013 along with other strangers hired by other people \u2013 try to save some children who have fallen into a lake. \u00a0Yet it looks like these strangers can only get to the lake by pushing through a crowded rave on a pier with no railings.\u201d\u00a0 (pp. 25-6)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wenar thinks Singer\u2019s principle doesn\u2019t apply to our situation, because our situation involves risk of harm to others, and (Wenar claims) Singer\u2019s principle,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201c\u2026draws attention to only one kind of negative effect of our contributing to aid: \u00a0that we ourselves may \u2018sacrifice\u2019 \u2013 that we ourselves may have less disposable money or time.\u201d\u00a0 (p. 24)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But (as Wenar himself acknowledges in footnote 46 of his essay) Singer intends for \u201csacrifice\u201d to be understood more broadly than this, such that his principle would not imply that you ought to prevent bad when this would mean violating a deontological constraint (e.g. against harming, stealing, lying, promise-breaking, and so on).\u00a0 I think it\u2019s clear that this has been Singer\u2019s intention in all of his writings making use of this principle.\u00a0 Still, Wenar is right that Singer did not explicitly draw attention to risk of harm to people living in extreme poverty as a possible clash with deontological constraints.\u00a0 And Wenar is right that in the pond example there\u2019s no mention of risk of harm, whereas we donors live in the real, risk-filled world.</p>\n<p>In response to Wenar, one could point out, <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/full/10.1086/663583\">as Nick Beckstead does</a>, that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWhile it is plausible that some aid involves [deontologically prohibited] harms (e.g., aid to regions that are overrun by corrupt warlords), other cases seem less worrisome, for example, providing technical assistance to a deworming program in India. \u00a0Admittedly, providing such assistance may divert employment from the private sector, produce bad incentives, or partly replace government effort, and hence weighing these losses against the gains produced by the program might require some cost-benefit analysis and thinking about how to aggregate harms and benefits. \u00a0However, implementing the program does not seem to involve any tragic violations of rights or have any other worrisome deontological features.\u201d\u00a0 (p. 416)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in cases of giving to charities that would impose only these kinds of \u201ceconomic harms\u201d for the sake of big health benefits, Singer\u2019s principle would indeed ground a call to action \u2013 that is, if imposing such harms for the sake of providing such benefits isn\u2019t in fact prohibited by a plausible constraint against harming.</p>\n<p>I am sympathetic to Beckstead\u2019s style of response, and would like to say a bit more to extend it.\u00a0 In particular, notice that the <em>size</em> of the risk of any significant harm of giving to a deworming charity \u2013 or for that matter any of <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell\u2019s top-ranked charities</a> \u2013 seems fairly small.\u00a0 The following position seems to me sensible:\u00a0 one would be in violation of no plausible deontological constraint if one imposed a <em>fairly small</em> risk of harm on some in order to (with a <em>high degree</em> of certainty) <em>substantially</em> benefit others.</p>\n<p>Some might disagree.\u00a0 Imagine an absolutist view that implied that, as long as there is <em>some</em> risk that your act will do harm, it\u2019s impermissible.\u00a0 Given that we\u2019re stuck in the real, risk-filled world, <em>no matter what we do</em> there is <em>some</em> risk we\u2019ll do harm, and thus this view implies that no matter what we do, we act impermissibly.\u00a0 However, I acted permissibly just now when I blinked my eyes, so this view is false.\u00a0 (I apologize if through some Butterfly Effect my blinking will in fact cause an avalanche, destroying a town in the Alps\u2026)</p>\n<p>The more moderate position above that I said seems sensible contains a number of vaguely specified quantities (in italics).\u00a0 How must these fields be filled in such that no plausible deontological constraint is violated?\u00a0 I am not sure how much precision can, in principle, be offered here.</p>\n<p>But I do think I can offer something useful.\u00a0 Consider a parent who wants to give her 9-year-old son a fun weekend at Disneyland.\u00a0 She also has an infant daughter, who is too young to get any enjoyment out of the trip.\u00a0 The parent drives both children for six hours on the freeway to get to Disneyland, knowing that there is a risk they will be killed in a car accident.\u00a0 Nonetheless, most of us would say that the parent did not violate any plausible deontological constraint; this seems to be in part because the risk of harm she imposed on her children is <em>fairly small</em>.</p>\n<p>I would wager that the risk (of economic harm) to those living in extreme poverty from you donating $50 to <a href=\"http://www.evidenceaction.org/#deworm-the-world\">Deworm the World</a> is also fairly small, probably comparable to the risk of death associated with six hours of freeway driving.\u00a0 And if it\u2019s permissible for a parent to impose this fairly small risk of<em> death</em> for a weekend of fun, then presumably it\u2019s permissible for a donor to impose a comparably small risk of <em>economic harm</em> to achieve major health benefits for many children ($50 would be enough to deworm 100 children).</p>\n<p>A worry is that the bigger the donation you give, the greater the risk.\u00a0 Very large donations may no longer yield <em>fairly small </em>risks of harm, but sizeable ones.\u00a0 One point to keep in mind here is that while a very large donation may impose more risk of harm, it would bring about correspondingly more <em>benefit</em>.\u00a0 Still, it is unclear how plausible it is that <em>if</em> the amount of risk imposed in donating $50 is made permissible by deworming 100 children, <em>then</em> the amount of risk imposed in donating $5,000 is made permissible by deworming 10,000 children.\u00a0 For one thing, there may well be a non-linear relationship between donation size and risk size.</p>\n<p>But suppose you added up all the annual donations to a particular deworming charity.\u00a0 How much risk (of economic harm) is imposed, in aggregate, by all these donations?\u00a0 I welcome any corrections on this score, but \u2013 based on what I know about the activities and results of deworming charities over the past several years \u2013 my guess is that not much risk of economic harm is imposed even by a whole year of donations.\u00a0 I can add to this that there are <a href=\"http://www.povertyactionlab.org/publication/deworming-best-buy-development\">documented economic benefits of deworming</a> (it\u2019s easier for people to go to work and school when they aren\u2019t infected).\u00a0 Maybe the greatest risk of a mass donation to a deworming charity is decreased government effort.\u00a0 But it turns out that in many places where deworming projects take place <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative#footnote90_6gsjgsh\">it is unlikely governments would have provided funds if NGOs had not</a>.</p>\n<p>One philosophically interesting question is what to make of cases \u2013 unlike deworming \u2013 where very large donations <em>do</em> carry with them sizable risks of harm.\u00a0 Then we will have to determine whether the proportionately greater good done by the large donation makes it permissible to impose the large risk.\u00a0 It\u2019s possible to hold the view that, once the size of the risk (of some particular harm) is <em>sufficiently large</em>, it would be a violation of the deontological constraint against doing harm to impose this risk even if the good brought about were proportionately greater.\u00a0 That is, maybe R is the risk threshold, and while it\u2019s permissible to bring about .25R risk for the sake of saving 1,000 lives, it\u2019s impermissible to bring about R risk for the sake of saving 4,000 lives.\u00a0 This view has the implication that, while it would be permissible for me to make a donation every three months to a charity, each which imposes .25R risk and saves 1,000 lives and which would taken together over the course of a year impose R risk and save 4,000 lives, it would be impermissible for me to lump these donations together, making a single annual donation. \u00a0I don\u2019t intend for this to be a convincing objection to the view, I merely want to flag a further philosophically interesting complication.</p>\n<p>Wenar has done us a service by clearly and carefully presenting a number of important considerations that are relevant to donating to overseas aid agencies that aim to help people in extreme poverty.\u00a0 However, I agree with Beckstead that Singer\u2019s principle applies to the risk-filled world we donors find ourselves in; and the most highly-ranked charities are also ones that are pretty innocuous from the standpoint of deontological constraints.\u00a0 If you are skeptical of this, but still want to help, you could give to a reputable organization that rigorously studies extreme poverty interventions, such as <a href=\"http://www.poverty-action.org/\">IPA</a> or <a href=\"http://www.povertyactionlab.org/\">J-PAL</a>.\u00a0 There\u2019s almost surely no harm in that.</p>\n<p><em>(I am grateful to

{"date": "19th Jun 2015", "title": "Collective Action and Individual Impact, Part II", "author": "zdgroff", "num_comments": "18 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Cross posted at zachgroff.com</p>\n<p><span>In my last long post, I argued that if we can greatly help a promising collective action, we are obligated to do so. I did not argue that any particular protest has or will be effective, although I offered a few illustrative examples. I thank Carl Shulman and Ben Kuhn for their helpful responses to my original post. In this post, I would like to argue that the habit of supporting social movements is a good one to have and offer a few examples.<br> <br> To start, let's consider a few problems where protesting could likely make a difference. It seems to me protests rely on having a problem that is fairly concrete and direct, with an identifiable institution at fault. Poverty in developing countries strikes me as lacking in a clear target for a protest, and existential risk strikes me as too abstract and, again, lacking in a clear target.<br> <br> These are problems that severely affect large numbers of people and are at least somewhat tractable:<br> <br> -Mass incarceration<br> -Climate change<br> -Global institutional reform relevant to poverty<br> -Immigration and open borders<br> -Animal agriculture<br> <br> Now let's look at the costs and benefits of participating in a protest. Carl Shulman writes, \"But to be convincing you have to actually show your work that the returns on protesting really are competitive with the opportunity cost of time (e.g. earning and donating some money, studying to advance your career and ability to get things done, doing malaria research, resting up after all of the above).\"<br> <br> Though time is approximately fungible, it seems likely that people sort their time,</span><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/Richard.Thaler/research/pdf/MentalAccounting.pdf\"><span>like money</span></a>, into budget categories. Given that, we must ask which category protesting is likely to come out of. It seems unlikely it would come out of one's job and more likely to\u00a0come out of either resting up or self-improvement.<br> <br> A basic economic approach would value leisure time at the amount one could earn in that time, but going to a protest doesn't obliterate leisure time - it simply replaces the alternative activity with going to a protest. This will be costlier for some people than for others. If marching is a chore, this cost could approach or even surpass the</span><span> </span><span>forgone earnings, but if marching is energizing, or even just benign, the cost could be fairly low. The cost will also, of course, depend on how important your being well-rested is - getting less sleep to march in a protest would be quite costly for a life-saving surgeon.<br> <br> To get more specific, again quoting Carl Shulman, \"If the tens of millions of person-hours spent on the protests were spent at minimum wage jobs and the proceeds donated, then tens of thousands of African lives would have been saved; if one can earn higher wages or contribute in other scarce ways, the opportunity\u00a0cost will be larger still.\"<br> <br> I assume he is going with</span><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Costperlifesaved\"><span>GiveWell's estimate</span></a></span><span>\u00a0</span><span>that $3,340 given to the Against Malaria Foundation can, on expectation, save one life. 300,000 people at, say, the People's Climate March, had they spent five hours at a minimum wage job instead of marching would have earned enough to save about 3,000 lives. As stated above, I don't think that working is the relevant alternative - protesting would most likely detract from mentally allotted leisure time. Still, even if leisure time is worth 1/10th the amount of time that work time is (and the people marching work minimum wage jobs on average), that march had an opportunity cost of 300 lives that could have been saved, a pretty hefty opportunity cost.<br> <br> How unfavorable is this comparison? Well let's turn to the benefits.<br> <br> The benefits of any one action are far more diffuse and less measurable than the sort of interventions effectiveness-minded people like to favor. Clearly, the benefits will vary greatly by protest. Each year there are many, many protests with little effect. As someone who grew up outside of Washington, D.C., I can report that every time I visited the White House, I saw a protest outside for a cause that would likely be forgotten.<br> <br> Yet every so often there is a protest with a profound effect. I cited the People's Climate March in my original post, and that protest, which appeared on</span><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/nyregion/new-york-city-climate-change-march.html\"><span>the front page of the New York Times</span></a>, seems to have catalyzed one of the liveliest student protest movements in years, which has kept climate change in headlines across the country and perhaps led to Senate Democrats'</span><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/us/politics/keystone-xl-pipeline.html\"><span>scuttling of a bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline</span></a>.<br> <br> Meanwhile, the Black Lives Matter marches have made</span><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cory-booker/our-criminal-legal-system_b_7071792.html\"><span>racism in the criminal justice system</span></a></span><span>\u00a0</span><span>one of the principal political issues of 2015, and while police in the U.S. kill 1,000 people each year, the U.S. prison population numbers above 2,000,000, which is significant considering the potential tractability of the problem and the misery of being imprisoned, is a worthwhile problem.<br> <br> But beyond this anecdotal evidence, there is a fairly strong scholarly consensus that protests work, spanning</span><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/25/americans-dont-like-protests-but-protests-may-work-anyway/\"><span>political science</span></a>,</span><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Power-Movement-Movements-Contentious-Comparative/dp/052115572X\"><span>history</span></a>, and</span><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/dyanagi/Research/TeaParty_Protests.pdf\"><span>economics</span></a>. Specifically, political scientists' estimates of the effectiveness of nonviolent protest movements range from</span><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2374098\"><span>37%</span></a></span><span>\u00a0</span><span>to</span><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"http://moreintelligentlife.com/blog/john-paul-omalley/qa-steven-pinker-psychologist\"><span>75%</span></a></span><span>\u00a0</span><span>of such movements achieving their goals.</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Of course, that protest movements work does not tell us how well they work, which is what we need to compare participation in them to the alternative.</span><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/dyanagi/Research/TeaParty_Protests.pdf\"><span>A highly rigorous study</span></a></span><span>\u00a0</span><span>of the Tea Party movement estimated that an additional protester at a Tea Party rally produced 12 extra votes for the Republican party (the question of whether voting matters may be the subject of a later blog post). There aren't many other estimates like this in the literature.<br> <br> There are many reasons the Tea Party estimate might be an over-estimate for a standard protest, even more so a large one. For one, the Tea Party protests were fairly small, so an additional person likely yielded larger returns. For two, there's a case to be made that the Tea Party protests happened at a favorable time politically with the pendulum swinging back from extremely large expectations for the incoming President.<br> <br> So let's take that estimate and divide it by 10. Suppose each person at the People's Climate March produced an extra 1.2 votes in favor of climate action. That's 360,000 extra votes for climate action. Some very rudimentary back-of-the-envelope math using</span><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/probdecisive2.pdf\"><span>estimates by Nate Silver</span></a></span><span>\u00a0</span><span>of the chance that a vote swings an election yields an estimate of a .6% chance of swinging a Presidential election. If swinging the election improves the chance of climate action by 50%, then this march would increase the chance of climate action by .3%. Now if we use as a ballpark estimate the</span><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"http://www.robertstavinsblog.org/2014/06/19/what-are-the-benefits-and-costs-of-epas-proposed-co2-regulation/\"><span>EPA's estimated net global benefits</span></a></span><span>\u00a0</span><span>of climate regulations ($67 billion), this march would, on expectation, yield an expected $201 million in benefits - enough to save 60,000 lives.<br> <br> Many of my assumptions may have inflated this estimate - chiefly, the assumption that the likelihood of each vote swinging the election is independent. I also based each person's wage on the minimum wage - clearly many people will earn several times the minimum wage. On the other hand, one could argue that I made a conservative estimate of individual impact, and that I assigned to each marcher the average likelihood of swinging an election, which should underestimate the impact since marchers who are from swing states have a higher chance of swinging the election by an order of magnitude. If the march had 1/200th the impact, it would still outweigh the opportunity cost.<br> <br> There are some further problems, though. We just looked at aggregate or average impact, rather than marginal impact. It is likely that the 300,000th marcher does not have a marginal impact equal to the average impact. The relationship between marginal impact and number of marchers is quite unclear. It seems most likely to me that marginal impact would have an S-shape: protesting by yourself or with a few of your buddies likely has very little impact because of the strength (or weakness) in numbers. An additional person would probably do much more good for a small- or medium-sized march.</span></p>\n<p><span><br> Given this, it seems to me to be roughly a toss up that the average person in the People's Climate March would have much of an expected impact, let alone a high-impact person with potential for higher wages and other factors. But this march was likely not all that high on the effectiveness scale. For a medium-sized march around a potentially higher-impact issue like, say, open borders or animal agriculture, it seems plausible to me that attendance at a march would be high-impact. Given that we are habit-forming creatures, I think an effective person ought to make a habit of showing support for small- to medium-sized protests around highly important causes.<br> <br> The case is stronger as one moves higher up on the collective action ladder. Organizing a protest, or helping to organize one, can mean getting many more people out. The opportunity cost is of course larger as well, but turning out a large enough number of people with a fraction of your effectiveness can create a multiplier effect. People within the effective altruism movement have pushed for more</span><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/jyz/effective_effective_altruism_fundraising_and/\"><span>movement-building</span></a></span><span>\u00a0</span><span>and</span><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/strategy/strategies/advocacy/\"><span>advocacy</span></a></span><span>\u00a0</span><span>for their multiplier effects. There are possible (and promising) alternative proposals to political protests - pledge parties to pledge to donate 10% of one's income with</span><span>\u00a0</span><span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\"><span>Giving What We Can</span></a>, for instance - but these seem better for consolidating and utilizing a community than building one.

factual beliefs. Nevertheless, that often happens. Many factual issues are politically controversial - typically because the true answer makes a certain political course of action more plausible - and on those issues, many partisans tend to disregard politically uncomfortable evidence.</span></p>\n<p><span>This sort of political bias has been demonstrated in a large number of psychological studies. For instance,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/09/new-study-politics-makes-you-innumerate\">Yale professor Dan Kahan and his collaborators showed in a fascinating experiment</a>\u00a0that on politically controversial questions, people are quite likely to commit mathematical mistakes that help them\u00a0<em><span>retain\u00a0</span></em>their beliefs, but much less likely to commit mistakes that would force them to\u00a0<em><span>give up\u00a0</span></em>those belies. Examples like this abound in the literature.</span></p>\n<p><span>Political bias is likely to be a major cause of misguided policies in democracies (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter\">even the main one according to economist Bryan Caplan</a>). If they don\u2019t have any special reason not to, people without special knowledge defer to the scientific consensus on technical issues. Thus, they do not interfere with the experts, who normally get things right. On politically controversial issues, however, they often let their political bias win over science and evidence, which means they\u2019ll end up with false beliefs. And, in a democracy voters having systematically false beliefs obviously more often than not translates into misguided policy.</span></p>\n<p><span>Can we reduce this kind of political bias? I\u2019m fairly hopeful. One reason for optimism is that debiasing generally seems to be possible to at least some extent. This optimism of mine was strengthened by participating in a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/9623753/The_Center_for_Applied_Rationality_practical_techniques_for_overcoming_biases\">CFAR workshop last year</a>. Political bias seems not to be fundamentally different from other kinds of biases and should thus be reducible too. But obviously one could argue against this view of mine. I\u2019m happy to discuss this issue further.</span></p>\n<p><span>Another reason for optimism is that it seems that the level of political bias is actually lower today than it was historically. People are better at judging politically controversial issues in a detached, scientific way today than they were in, say, the 14th century. This shows that progress is possible. There seems to be no reason to believe it couldn\u2019t continue.</span></p>\n<p><span>A third reason for optimism is that there seems to be a strong norm against political bias. Few people are consciously and intentionally politically biased. Instead most people seem to believe themselves to be politically rational, and hold that as a very important value (or so I believe). They fail to see their own biases due to the\u00a0<em><span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_blind_spot\">bias blind spot</a>\u00a0</span></em>(which disables us from seeing our own biases).</span></p>\n<p><span>Thus if you could somehow make it salient to people that they are biased, they would actually want to change. And if others saw how biased they are, the incentives to debias would be even stronger.</span></p>\n<p><span>There are many ways in which you could make political bias\u00a0<em><span>salient</span></em>. For instance, you could meticulously go through\u00a0<a href=\"https://stefanschubert.wordpress.com/2015/05/15/gingrich-vs-paul-as-an-example-of-argument-checking-subtitles-of-the-presidential-debates/\">political debaters\u2019 arguments</a>\u00a0and point out fallacies, like I have done on my blog. I will post more about that later. Here I want to focus on another method, however, namely a\u00a0<a href=\"http://programs.clearerthinking.org/political_bias_test.html#.VfLot5dRKi1\">political bias test</a>\u00a0which I have constructed with\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.clearerthinking.org/\">ClearerThinking</a>, run by EA-member Spencer Greenberg. Since learning how the test works might make you answer a bit differently, I will not explain how the test works here, but instead refer either to the explanatory sections of the test, or to Jess Whittlestone\u2019s (also an EA member)\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/9/10/9188517/political-bias\">Vox.com-article</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our hope is of course that people taking the test might start thinking more both about their own biases, and about the problem of political bias in general. We want this important topic to be discussed more. Our test is produced for the American market, but hopefully, it could work as a generic template for bias tests in other countries (akin to the\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_compass\">Political Compass</a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_advice_application\">Voting Advice Applications</a>).</span></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OIiIVrNwK6ftRZqLfEmhwXHj0tx-Uhg_N2kfBEFpuP0/edit?usp=sharing\">Here is a guide for making new bias tests</a>\u00a0(where the main criticisms of our test are also discussed). Also, we hope that the test could inspire academic psychologists and political scientists to construct full-blown scientific political bias tests.</span></p>\n<p><span>This does not mean, however, that we think that such bias tests in themselves will get rid of the problem of political bias. We need to attack the problem of political bias from many other angles as well. I will return to this problem in later posts.</span></p>\n<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:WordDocument> <w:View>Normal</w:View> <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom> <w:TrackMoves /> <w:TrackFormatting />

Direct donations are based on trusting what the person has done before, and what she claims she will do now. They are more stable than certificates - which are as stable as bounty hunting - and thus could be the entire source of income for individuals funded by donors who share their values, instead of institutional donations. Direct donations are also </span><span>much cheaper</span><span> per worker hour than institutional donations. As a back of the envelope calculation I estimated the difference as about threefold, and even after factoring 501c, charity status, Patreon\u2019s fee, and all other discounts, it remains two times more expensive to donate to institutions than directly.</span></p>\n<p><span>The current climate within the Effective Altruism community is one of </span><span>skepticism</span><span> of </span><span>direct funding</span><span> which receives a </span><span>small fraction of resources</span><span>,</span><span> skepticism</span><span> of </span><span>certificates of impact</span><span>, which also receive a </span><span>small fraction of resources</span><span>, and </span><span>profound trust</span><span> in institutions. This trust at a recent EA Think Tank meeting was called \u201csanctification\u201d of institutions - which receive </span><span>the vast majority of financial and volunteering resources</span><span> from Effective Altruist donors. This is unjustified and could be taken as a temporary failure in the moral market. I expect this trend to change over time as the ideas of direct funding and currencies such as certificates of impact become more integrated into the strategic thinking of individual donors, and the snowball of increasing trust in long-term committed individuals generates a self-reinforcing incentive.</span></p>\n<p><span>Direct donations would be a great addition to the moral market, since they offer many advantages, some of which are simply unavailable to institutions or certificates of impact. Let us look at some of these advantages:</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Direct funding permits investigation of neglected causes: </span><span>It requires merely two individuals for a cause to be investigated. If, for example, a single donor considers an investigation on the disruptive potential of Emulation Economics to the global economy, and one individual wants to undertake this research, this suffices for at least some attention to be allocated to that problem. Even causes neglected </span><span>within</span><span> EA can be evaluated.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Direct funding is stable over time: </span><span>Certificates of impact pay backward in time. An individual cannot anticipate to receive them beforehand because other projects may be judged more valuable. Direct donations done monthly could guarantee security for EAs that intend to zig-zag between institutions, researchers who want to research a specific cause, and other helpers who would undertake a function that isn\u2019t defined by a job-role. Direct donations are a contract of trust between donor and donee, and the donee could establish ways for the donors to keep track of the work they are paying for, such as by sending periodic reports or having periodic meetings.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Direct funding permits unusual work</span><span>: Performance is hard to measure. Individuals who travelled between EA institutions and influenced the EA movement via hard to assess means (e.g. Michael Vassar, Justin Shoevelain, Jasen Murray, Scott Aaronson...) are frequently volunteering their time and effort to EA causes. Some of these individuals have built a reputation of doing great work as EAs though they were always behind different projects. In theory, institutions could hire such people, but in practice, direct donations would be a much more efficient way of incentivizing more people to be EA generalists. Once a thread of trust is built, these EAs could have freedom to work in what seems more appropriate to them, as long as their backers still thought they were on the right track. More importantly, many more people could begin to work as EA generalists who currently don\u2019t even consider that possibility, the labour market would become more fluid.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Direct funding prevents groupthink: </span><span>Institutions need to have their focus well understood, and require some level of internal goal alignment. Bold new different ideas of what needs to be done by EAs, or what needs to be researched, or new methods of research won\u2019t come easily out of institutions - this is less of a problem within the EA community than outside it, but the problem is not completely eliminated. Direct funding would attenuate it even further; If a person with a good track record of EA ideas in the past wants to pursue a very different project, their direct donors could guarantee their financial stability without jeopardizing either the person\u2019s action flexibility, nor the reputation of the institution to which the person works for, since there would be none.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Direct funding is instantaneous: </span><span>Hiring an individual can take a long time, especially a foreigner. Direct donations can be done as soon as there is an agreement on conditions and trust between donor and donee.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Direct funding facilitates international EA work: </span><span>The reasons here are clear. It is bureaucratically less costly to transfer money internationally than to do it via institutions.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Direct funding makes moving to EA hubs easier: </span><span>Many EAs move to locations with more EAs. It is much easier to do this if there are stable income sources that are region independent and provide a fallback during the period of transition. More importantly, donations are considered passive income, and as far as I know donations within a bounded range can be received by non-US citizens in US soil, even in non-favorable Visa conditions. Similar constraints are relaxed for donations to other countries as well. To move to Oxford, Berkeley, Switzerland or Melbourne would be much easier at the moment for EAs who are receiving the majority or entirety of income through direct donations.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Direct funding alters the mindset of the recipient: </span><span>If you are hired by an EA institution to do a particular set of tasks, you are being paid to do those tasks, and help that organization do well in its function. If you are directly being paid to be an EA however, this is much more ingrained in your identity. There are people paying you to do the most good you can do. If you see an opportunity for doing good, you will be more likely to take it, since you are never done with the obligation of being a great EA.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Direct funding can be the entire source of income of an individual:</span><span> This seems to be the untapped secret of direct funding. If someone wants to do EA work all the time, they can be fully funded by donors so as to not need any institutional affiliation, or have a token one. This threshold will be what determines the ultimate value of direct donations, since the point at which there are sufficient incentives for individuals to try doing this as their main income source will be the tipping point for most of the advantages above to manifest in full. When people can confidently undertake an EA career or a paid year on the basis of donation, then the labor market will have the necessary fluidity to accrue all of the advantages that can be had via direct funding.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Even though they are important all these advantages and details are completely dominated by the crucial factor when it comes to effective donation.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"Direct_Funding_is_Very_Cheap__\"><span>Direct Funding is Very Cheap </span><span>\u00a0</span></h2>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Institutions are made of people. When you pay an institution to do something, you are ultimately paying the people participating in it to do something. If you are an effective altruist donating to an EA charity, then you are paying someone </span><span>because you want them to do something</span><span>. This thing is what has value for you. Having institutions and charity status are very valuable for the EA movement, and it is one of the ways in which it causes </span><span>a lot of people to do a lot of things</span><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>The question then is, is there a niche or a space for causing people to do what needs to be done also outside institutional boundaries?</span></p>\n<p><span>The response is a resounding </span><span>yes!</span></p>\n<p><span>Why would we want to complement institutional roles with individual roles? Basically because individuals are cheap. It costs a lot in donations to hire a new worker at an institution, whereas there are many EAs who would (and do) work for much less money. Individuals who work in EA institutions frequently cost 75.000USD or more per year to their donors. Some EAs on the other hand would be happy and willing to work on their project for a third of that, 25.000USD. In fact for a couple years at least some EA organization paid less than that. The difference in cost to donors is striking. Even after accounting for the fees that Patreon and Gratipay charges (~3%), tax exemptions for charities and other advantages, the difference is still very substantial. Institutions have to bear many costs that individuals don\u2019t have to, and if I recall correctly, direct donations are not subject to income tax on the donee\u2019s part, which makes it even cheaper for the donors. Sometimes institutions also have to pay according to a table that determines how much people in different jobs should make, irrespective of whether both parties would prefer otherwise. No such constraint exists for donations.</span></p>\n<p><span>For an altruistic donor, there are two numbers that matter: number of dollars that they have spent on the thing they value, and number of things that got done towards that value being accomplished. The cheapest way to do so seems to me hands down to be direct donation to individuals. It is at least twice as cheap.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Why Are Institutions Sacralized?</span></p>\n<p><span>When discussing this strange phenomenon with other EAs, someone (who works for a high paying institution, so I\u2019ll protect their name) suggested this interesting question. It seems to me that the reason why institutions are sacralized is that it feels like an institution is much closer to a cause or goal in mental space. The association between \u201csaving the environment\u201d and \u201cGreenpeace\u201d is much stronger than that of \u201csaving the environment\u201d and \u201cAl Gore\u201d. Al Gore may have strongly advocated for environmental causes, but a person seems less like a cause than an institution does. The forest, however, is made of trees, and Greenpeace is made, in great part, of people working in environmental causes.</span></p>\n<p><span>EAs are notorious for their ability to reason through their felt sense, and do what they think is valuable even if it doesn\u2019t necessarily feel immediately right. EAs are probably good then at combating the felt sense that donating to institutions is donating directly to a cause, instead of for people who work on/advocate/research on a cause. Donating to institutions is paying for the people who work there, plus taxes, rent, retirement benefits, legal fees, institutional costs, and many other collaterals. Maybe 70% or even 90% of EA paid work should indeed be done through institutions and wages, but I am very skeptical that not even 10 EAs should be being paid directly to work on EA projects, research, advocacy, etc\u2026 When we consider that this could also be done to pay individuals temporarily while they rearrange Visa situations, while their legal contract is processed, or that it can be used to finance EAs who live in countries with advantageous currencies, I find it impressive that this was not chosen by anyone yet as the problem they will solve.</span></p>\n<p><span>Creating an EA donation network is one of the most valuable things we can do. Ozzie Gooen, Patrick Brinich-Langlois, and many others have begun to do this, but more needs to be done, and more donors should consider direct donations their primary place to donate. Also, we should concentrate our donations toward EAs with good portfolios of EA work completed, until donations amount to a significant fraction of their income. Having 10 individuals receiving 1/10th of the institutional cost for 1 worker won\u2019t give any of them the security and trust needed to pursue an EA career and EA projects, but having 3 receive 1/3rd of that instead would likely cause all three of them to feel confident in this opportunity. At least two times more work would be done. If this were life-saving work, then twice the lives would be saved. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>As the unnamed person above pointed out: It is as if EA institutions have become sacred, but there is no reason for this.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Improving Direct Donations Between EAs</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Patreon versus Gratipay</span></p>\n<p><span>Ozzie - who put up the Gratipay network - and I advocate a transition to Patreon as quickly as possible, since it is much more likely to be standing in the near future, Gratipay has gone down once already and has lower transaction volume. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong><span>Trust</span><span> </span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span>One issue that comes up when discussing direct donations is \u201chow to make sure the donors trust their donees to be doing good work?\u201d This is one more reason to reduce the number of baskets in which donors should put their eggs. It is much easier to have one or two individuals you trust doing work you value, and keep track of what they are doing, than to invest at once in many people. Especially for neglected causes, it is valuable to have a setting where only one large or two smaller donors suffice to finance someone they trust.</span></p>\n<p><span>Feedback</span></p>\n<p><span>It is of course up to the dyad to establish how they will determine for how long the donations continue, how much freedom the donee has to change projects, and which types of report they will give. To make this easier, donees could have a standard way to report to their donors, and make contextual adjustments when requested.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"Evaluation\"><span>Evaluation</span></h2>\n<p><span>EA donors have especially high regard for external evaluators such as GiveWell, GWWC and Animal Charity Evaluators. If individuals are competing with organizations for funds, it is likely that donors will place a similar burden of proof on each. As such, an evaluator for directly funded individuals might become necessary (although note that explicitly EA-aligned organizations which rely on donations, such as CEA, also fall outside the scope of current external evaluators).</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Guarantees</span></p>\n<p><span>Eventually, it would also be valuable to have financial guarantees for donees being funded. If a donor decides to stop funding a person responsible for a project (say because they had a financial emergency), the person still gets funded for 1 or 2 months by a guarantee fund, and gets some extra exposition to other prospective donors, who may choose to save the project from going under and the person from financial insecurity. Even if there were a guarantee bank, the whole process would still be much cheaper than hiring people institutionally.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span>In the next post on Moral Economics Giles Edkins will discuss several new ideas related to Certificates of Impact, and suggestions on how to create a moral market. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Don't forget to check the ignite talk on Moral Economics if you are going to EA Global at the Googleplex on Saturday.</span></p></div></div>"},

One reason <a href=\"/blog.givewell.org/2015/12/09/staff-members-personal-donations-for-giving-season-2015\">cited</a> by a staff member is:</p>\n<p><span>\"I am persuaded by\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/20/give-now-or-give-later/\">the argument that good done in the present probably compounds over time</a>\"</p>\n<p>This is true. But does it compound faster than the alternative over all timescales?</p>\n<p>Paul Christiano <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/03/12/giving-now-vs-later/\">has pointed out</a> that while charitable giving such as cash transfers and basic health services probably compound (socially) very quickly to begin with (maybe 20% in the first year), these incredible rates of compounding must decline over time. Otherwise these small charitable acts would quickly become responsible for all of the good in the world. What sustainable level of compounding can they achieve in the long run? The <em>global economic growth rate</em>, which would mean they converge to, at most, a fixed share of the world's economy or welfare.</p>\n<p>High-risk business investments by nature compound more quickly than the global economic growth rate. This is the classic 'r &gt; g', which has become widely understood due to Piketty.</p>\n<p>As a result, in the long term, investing at this higher rate to fund a much larger donation long in the future could be better.</p>\n<p>For the sake of illustration, let's say the global economic growth rate is 3%, the return on business equity is 5%, and the internal rate of compounding of say, cash transfers, is 20% in the first year, 18% in the second, then 16%, 14%, 12%, 10%, 8%, 6%, 4%, and 3% thereafter. (This set of numbers is probably generous to the 'giving later' strategy, but it will help to highlight the difference.) Holding all else constant, how long would the 'invest and give later' strategy take to catch up?</p>\n<p>The answer is about 40 years:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Gfj6TaK.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>What if you also count the same initial burst of rapidly compounding social impact at the point that you give later - say, in year 28?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VzpehkM.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>You get a bigger take-off, because the donation itself is much bigger when given later. Now 'give later' looks significantly better.</p>\n<p>I think the natural response is that 'GiveWell classic' donors expect opportunities to end extreme poverty to dry up significantly over such a timescale. It may be that extreme poverty and malaria are eradicated, or nearly so, by that time. By then the world will be richer and the very poor much less numerous, and so the difficulty of finding extraordinary opportunities much higher. This seems entirely plausible.</p>\n<p>If the cost effectiveness of the best giving opportunities were to decline by 2% each year - roughly a halving every 40 years - then the 'invest and give later' strategy won't be able to catch up.</p>\n<p>Whether the decline is actually that steep, I'm not sure.</p>\n<p>And if you're giving to causes other than global poverty, <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/give-now-or-later/\">quite different considerations</a> can dominate.</p></div></div>"},

We messaged people on the EA London Facebook group who are currently studying in London and 11 out of the 13 contacted said they were willing to help in some capacity, ranging from telling friends about it to actively setting up a society. We have people willing to set up chapters at UCL, LSE, Kings, Imperial, Regents and LSHTM.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>What Went Right</span></p>\n<p><span>There are four universities with very active EA London members that are setting societies up, applying for official status and arranging talks for students.</span></p>\n<p><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>What Went Wrong</span></p>\n<p><span>We missed out on most applications for freshers fair which is probably one of the best way to raise awareness amongst people joining university. There are quite a few universities that haven\u2019t been contacted yet and we haven\u2019t found the key one or two passionate people to start the process at most places.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Q2 Goals</span></p>\n<p><span>To continue finding students at universities in London who want to set up societies and to introduce these leads to people who have already started this process to pass on advice.</span></p>\n<p><span>To create official societies that can be given free marketing and a free stall at freshers fair by the universities for next year. To normalise the idea of having an EA society at a London University.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span><strong>Workplace Marketing</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Q1 Goals</span></p>\n<p><span>The team should meet to set goals (outside of the main strategy meeting) with ideas of goals being outreach to colleagues and workplace giving schemes.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Progress</span></p>\n<p><span>This team didn\u2019t meet before the second strategy meeting so no progress was made.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>What Went Wrong</span></p>\n<p><span>The lead person ended up not having the time to lead this project. We should make sure going forward that project leads have the time to organise and maybe have a monthly check up with each of the leaders to see how things are progressing so that we can switch earlier. We should also log which projects do make progress and which don\u2019t so that we can see what the differences are and what ways we can improve.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Q2 Goals</span></p>\n<p><span>We had the idea of giving more talks in London in places like coding bootcamps. We decided to merge this project with workplace marketing with someone who had more time to organise. The new goal is for this group to meet and arrange talks at workplaces or other venues in London and find people who would like to give talks about effective altruism.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span><strong>Events</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Q1 Goals</span></p>\n<p><span>To have more people help organise the monthly social meetings, to hold the Peter Singer talk on 8th and 11th of June, to potentially have a casino night.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Progress</span></p>\n<p><span>The Peter Singer talks filled capacity and led to more interest on Meetup and Facebook, there is a pub social arranged monthly and there have been summer picnics as well. I didn\u2019t hear anything about the casino events discussed in this meeting.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>What Went Right</span></p>\n<p><span>There are more events and more people attending each month as well as slightly more varied events. Looking at Meetup, between the 25th of April and 18th of July we went from 271 members to 423 and from 102 active members to 116. On Facebook we went from 239 members to 351.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>What Went Wrong</span></p>\n<p><span>Event organising has tended to end up with the same person each time and it would be better if this could be spread out between more people. Events were mainly pub based and happen after work in Central London and could drive away people who don\u2019t want to go to a dingy pub on a weeknight in Holborn.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Q2 Goal</span></p>\n<p><span>Have more people organising events, have events for different careers and at different venues.

This figure is surprisingly low: $2-5 per year. This suggests that personal dietary change, relative to other things we can do, is fairly ineffective. Yet most EAs interested in animal welfare are eager that others, including other EAs, stop using animal products. I explore a variety of means of resolving this tension, and recommend a large downward adjustment to the efficacy of animal charities is the best solution.\u00a0<a title=\"This is a follow-on from an earlier attempt. The more involved discussion of non-consequentialist approaches I owe to comments on fb and the EA forum in general, and to Carl Shulman\u2019s helpful remarks in particular.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/at-what-cost-carnivory/#note-356-1\"><span>1</span></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</h1>\n<p>Animal agriculture causes vast amounts of suffering: not only in virtue of animals being killed for their meat, but also the suffering they undergo whilst alive in industrial agriculture. Many in EA consider this an important and neglected cause, and among Effective Altruists who focus on animal agriculture, reducing consumption of animal products (mainly meat, eggs, and dairy) is cause commonly advocated for. Reduce the consumption of animal products, and you reduce the production of animal suffering.\u00a0<a title=\"There is one significant complication: generally these interventions \u2018work\u2019 by preventing farmed animals coming into existence in the first place. This may be a bad thing if you are optimistic that farmed animals generally have lives which are on balance worth living, despite their suffering. More exotically, even if you are pessimistic about farmed animals having lives worth living, this may be a good thing if you are even more\u00a0pessimistic about wild animals having lives worth living, as farmed animals could\u00a0displace wild animals who suffer even worse lives.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/at-what-cost-carnivory/#note-356-2\"><span>2</span></a>This activism is extended \u2018intra\u2019 EA, with advocacy for EAs individually and at corporate events to refrain from serving animal products.</p>\n<p>This invites the question as to how valuable an individual changing their diet is: EAs might prefer to keep eating meat, and be keen on quantifying just how much harm they are doing. These estimates are tricky: both\u00a0<a href=\"https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2014/11/21/when-should-an-effective-altruist-be-vegetarian/\">Katja Grace</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/how-bad-is-dairy\">Jeff Kaufman</a>\u00a0have offered approximate trade-offs for animal product consumption in terms of human welfare (or welfare generally), but a major uncertainty in their calculations is how to weigh human versus non-human welfare: are years of human life more valuable than years of chicken life? Or maybe animal lives in animal agriculture are further\u00a0<em>below</em>\u00a0zero than typical human lives are\u00a0<em>above</em>\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>Happily, thanks to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>, we have some estimates made of how cost-effectively one can avert animal suffering, which is denominated in a similar way to the expected costs of eating animal products derived by\u00a0<a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods/\">Brian Tomasik</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-suffering-is-in-the-standard-american-diet/\">Peter Hurford</a>. We can use these figures to estimate the cost equivalent in terms of donations to an effective charity for use of animal products.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Calculation\">Calculation</h1>\n<p>Peter Hurford estimates the typical American diet to cause\u00a0<a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-suffering-is-in-the-standard-american-diet/\">5.5 years of animal suffering</a>. Some components cause disproportionately more (e.g. eggs) or less (e.g. beef) than their proportion of\u00a0<a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods/\">weight</a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/want-to-kill-fewer-animals-give-up-eggs-not-meat/\">calorific content</a>. Thus (borrowing Hurfords numbers) a vegetarian diet where one maintains consumption of milk and eggs but eschews meats causes around a third of the animal suffering of a fully carnivorous diet. If avoids eggs as well and only consumes dairy, this avoids 98.6% of the suffering.\u00a0<a title=\"Hurford offers the following comparators: Giving up beef is ~2.1x as important as giving up dairy. Giving up beef is ~1.9x as important as giving up turkey. Giving up pork is ~2.9x as important as giving up beef. Giving up chicken meat is ~11.3x as important as giving up beef. Giving up eggs is ~11.8x as important as giving up beef. Giving up aquacultured fish is ~6.4x as important as giving up beef. We can use these multiples to put everything in terms of \u2018dairy units\u2019, and thus calculate the fraction of harm caused by particular diets: Dairy = 1 Beef = 2.1 Turkey = 1.1 (2.1/1.9) Pork = 6.1 (2.1*2.9) Chicken = 23.7 (11.3*2.1) Eggs = 24.8 (11.8*2.1) Fish = 13.4 TOTAL = 72.2  Fraction of harm (Full diet = 1, Vegan = 0):  Vegetarianism = Dairy+eggs/total = (1 + 24.8)/72.2 = 35.7%  Lactovegetarianism = Dairy/total = 1/72.2 = 1.4%\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/at-what-cost-carnivory/#note-356-3\"><span>3</span></a></p>\n<p>How much would it cost to avert 5.5 years of animal suffering? Earlier suggestions put the price of averting one year of animal suffering into\u00a0<a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dollar-worth.pdf\">sub-dollar</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-would-it-take-to-justify-vegetarian-advocacy/\">range</a>. Probably the best contemporary estimates are from Animal Charity Evaluators, who offer estimates for donations to particular charities in terms of animal lives averted. The \u2018raw figures\u2019 in terms of animal lives saved are similarly optimistic: ACE estimates\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/the-humane-league/\">the Humane League</a>saves\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/organizations/the-humane-league-review/\">3.4 animal lives per\u00a0<em>dollar spent</em></a>, and the other two organizations (Mercy for Animals and Animal Equality) do even better \u2013\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/organizations/mercy-for-animals-review/\">8.8</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/organizations/animal-equality-review/\">10.1</a>\u00a0animals per dollar respectively.</p>\n<p>ACE often use their leafleting and online ad calculators in their reviews of these charities. Helpfully, these output figures directly in terms of life-years averted. Let\u2019s use the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/interventions/online-ads/online-ads-calculator/\">calculator for online ads</a>. The central estimate is 2.64 years of factory farming averted per dollar (for leafleting, the figure is \u00a02.02 years/$). The estimate for the \u2018donation equivalent\u2019 to a year of veganism is thus:</p>\n<pre>Donation equivalent of veganism = Animal suffering of diet/suffering averted per dollar\n\n$2.08/year = 5.5 years of suffering per year/2.64 years averted per dollar.</pre>\n<p>One can use the prior adjustments to work out the donation equivalent of dairy alone versus full veganism (lactovegetarianism):</p>\n<pre>Donation equivalent of lactovegetarinaism = $2.08/year * proportion of harm attributable to dairy (1/72.2)\n= $0.03 / year</pre>\n<p>Or eggs and dairy (ovolactovegetarianism) over full veganism:</p>\n<pre>Donation equivalent of O-Lveg = $2.08 * proportion eggs and dairy (~0.357)\n= $0.74/year</pre>\n<p>These calculations elide differences between species, and implictly demand judgement calls as to how to equate years \u2018as a chicken\u2019 versus \u2018as a cow\u2019, etc. We can use the calculator another way to avoid these difficulties: as it also computes the number of ads needed to make one person stop consuming animal products, and for how long that effect is expected to last.\u00a0<a title=\"Another benefit is this will implicitly cover all impacts of reducing animal products, which may be important for those worried about the environmental impacts.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/at-what-cost-carnivory/#note-356-4\"><span>4</span></a>\u00a0The calculator dis-aggregates animal products into meat, eggs, and dairy. Fairly conservatively, we can take the lowest yield of these (dairy) to be the cost of an effective vegan, as once we have donated enough to make one person give up dairy, we have also made more than one person give up eggs and meat, and we can ignore the additional fractions of people avoiding eggs or meat alone.\u00a0<a title=\"This isn\u2019t perfectly conservative: data on \u2018how long do people stay vegan\u2019 is extrapolated from \u2018how long do people who limit animal products continue limiting\u2019, and I\u2019d speculate vegans might have higher rates of attrition than vegetarians. That said, the other adjusts are probably conservative.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/at-what-cost-carnivory/#note-356-5\"><span>5</span></a>\u00a0The calculator suggests that for $100 one can expect 3.68 people to give up dairy for an average of 6.2 years. Thus the approximate cost per year of veganism is:</p>\n<pre>Cost per year of 'veganism' = $100/(3.68*6.2) years of 'veganism'\n= $4.38 /year</pre>\n<p>The \u2018cost per year of lactovegetarianism\u2019 or vegetarianism can be estimated by looking at the (better) conversion rates to get people to stop using eggs (7.37 and 11.05 respectively), giving the cost per year of lactovegetarianism and vegetarianism at $2.12/year and $1.45/year respectively.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Uncertainties_and_over_estimation\">Uncertainties and over-estimation</h1>\n<p>These figures seem remarkably low. Should you believe them?</p>\n<p>There are a variety of minor considerations which could drive the estimate down somewhat. One may want to look at the balance of animal products in particular diets, or disagree with the implied intra-species comparisons. These might modify the bottom line figures somewhat, but not much \u2013 and, in any case, one could look at \u2018cost per vegan-year\u2019 estimates which obviate these sorts of worries. Another concern is you cannot \u2018just\u2019 buy ads, and the charities ACE recommends have some other activities \u2013 however, ACE does not believe these activities are always less cost effective than online ads, so correcting for other activities could get the estimate to go up instead of down.</p>\n<p>The chief concern should be overestimation by ACE. Granting the estimates are unbiased, one should still expect\u00a0<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/km6/why_the_tails_come_apart/\">regression to the mean</a>. If the underlying distribution of \u2018true\u2019 charity effectiveness is lognormal (or worse), the degree of regression could be orders of magnitude.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Offsets_and_second_order_Outcomes\">Offsets and second-order Outcomes</h1>\n<p>Suppose you have a less regressive mindset, and you are confident the real figures are not-too-far from ACE\u2019s estimates. One conclusion EAs might make is that their personal diets are no big deal, easily swamped as it is by the consequences of donations. Further, the very low cost of \u2018buying\u2019 veganism elsewhere makes it apt for\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/01/moral-offsetting/\">moral offsetting</a>\u00a0<a title=\"Despite my original post, I\u2019m less interested in moral offsetting as such. On thoroughgoing consequentialism, offsetting makes little sense. Either the \u2018offset charity\u2019 is the best way to spend your money or it isn\u2019t. If the former, you should donate to it anyway; if the latter, it would be better to give the offsetting money to the better cause. Perhaps better to use the \u2018cost of veganism\u2019 comparisons as a metric for comparing different moral behaviours, without demanding explicit offsetting. If being vegan is much more challenging than earning an extra hundred dollars, working on the latter seems a much better strategy.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/at-what-cost-carnivory/#note-356-6\"><span>6</span></a>\u00a0\u00a0-most carnivores (EAs included) probably have a consumer surplus from animal products greater than a few dollars per year (equating to cents per meal). However, most EAs who are interested in animal welfare hesitate to endorse these conclusions, and are still eager for their fellows to become vegan notwithstanding the greater ease of doing an equivalent amount of good by donation. Why?</p>\n<p>One\u00a0possibility is second order effects, currently neglected, that make veganism much more valuable. Being vegan might persuade others to refrain from animal products, and perhaps pushing social norms to a \u2018tipping point\u2019 where there\u2019s a dramatic change in our attitudes towards animals. Perhaps \u2013 someone advocating for animal welfare who nonetheless eats meat is unlikely to persuasive. Yet it seems unlikely these second order effects will be much greater than the primary one of the person involved (I\u2019m confident my lifelong vegetarianism has \u2018converted\u2019 &lt;&lt;1 carnivore).\u00a0<a title=\"As Carl notes elsewhere, the current vegetarian and vegan population being of a significant size speaks against really big second order effects.\u00a0Even on an exponential growth model, the present size of the vegan and vegetarian movement speaks against very fast growth rates, and a high expected \u2018R0\u2019 for being a vegan.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/at-what-cost-carnivory/#note-356-7\"><span>7</span></a>\u00a0The small \u2018cost\u2019 of the direct offset gives plenty of room to maneuver: I would be still happy to offset at 10x the \u2018list price\u2019 of the offset to conservative accommodate these effects.</p>\n<p>More importantly, one should expect these effects to accrue to donations as well. The people I persuade to refrain from animal products via donations will presumably have similar effects in terms of promoting pro-animal ideas or exerting pressure in their social network. Perhaps within the EA community vegans are particularly important, so that a vegan EA is worth much more than a vegan non-EA, perhaps as steering the EA community in a more animal-welfare direction would be very high impact. Yet considerations along these lines seem to recapitulate discussing the merits of animal causes versus other cause areas: direction seems fairly zero sum between cause areas, and directing more EA-energy to animal welfare is only desirable if this cause area is better than whatever area these energies would otherwise be directed towards.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Mutual_non_exclusivity_and_marginal_cost\">Mutual non-exclusivity and marginal cost</h1>\n<p>Another reply would be the juxtaposition between eating meat and giving money to animal causes is a false dilemma. Eating animal products does not reduce the amount of money one can donate (indeed, as plant-based diets are often cheaper, going vegan could available donation funds!)\u00a0<a title=\"But note this consideration can easily flip the other way, especially in the case of milk given how cheap it is to offset \u2013 if vegan substitutes for milk cost a tiny amount more, it becomes better to just drink cow milk and donate the cost savings.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/at-what-cost-carnivory/#note-356-8\"><span>8</span></a>\u00a0So being vegan\u00a0<em>and</em>\u00a0giving the money to animal charities seems better.</p>\n<p>Yet all of us fall considerably short of being ideal utility maximizing agents. Whether we talk about an explicit \u2018selfishness\u2019 or \u2018willpower budget\u2019, we can look at the margin of our current moral lapses and look at what aspects of our lives are best to push on. Given the apparent cheapness of turning others vegan and the difficulty for most of us in changing our diet, it seems easier to work on ways of giving a few dollars more rather than changing our diet. Similar reasoning applies to other arduous sacrifices which are not strictly \u2018mutually exclusive\u2019 with our donations (e.g. always having cold showers to help the climate).</p>\n<h1 id=\"Non_consequentialist_considerations\">Non-consequentialist considerations</h1>\n<p>The foregoing has only considered consequentialist concerns. There are others. One is an implied inconsistency: offsetting donations only work if there are some people willing to \u2018take the hit\u2019 and change their diet. Yet if we all opted to pay money in lieu of changing our diet, no diets would actually change. One could draw uncomfortable comparisons to indulgences, or the much maligned pharisees who paid others to pray on their behalf.</p>\n<p>Yet these \u2018if everyone did this, what would happen?\u2019 worries tend to go wrong. It would be bad if\u00a0<em>all</em>\u00a0charity workers went into banking, but that doesn\u2019t mean that\u00a0<em>none</em>\u00a0should. Perhaps this should be viewed more along the lines of moral trade, with people who really like animal products trading with those who really like money. If too many try and offset, the \u2018price\u2019 of converting people to veganism may rise too (Scott Alexander neatly explains how this could work\u00a0<a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/04/ethics-offsets/\">here</a>).\u00a0<a title=\"One may worry about other adverse consequences of direct moral offsetting, as it might be a hurdle towards dramatic social change in attitudes towards animals. Yet the sign of this effect is unclear \u2013 a wider recognition that eating animals is something that demands moral compensation may be important, and might be spread more easily if \u2018buy-in\u2019 is small donations rather than dietary change. Further, if one thinks consequentialising is good, widespread use of these things might be good too.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/at-what-cost-carnivory/#note-356-9\"><span>9</span></a></p>\n<p>A greater concern is this. We generally do not accept offsets with other sorts of immoral behaviour. \u2018Paying for\u2019 murder with a $10 000 donation to AMF (a multiple of the expected cost per life saved) seems morally outrageous, rather than good moral deal on net. In the same way, if animals have moral status, killing them and eating their bodies seems wrong in a way which cannot be washed away with sufficient offsetting donations.\u00a0<a title=\"Although it is perhaps worth noting non-consequentialist moral theories might assign moral status on non-welfarist grounds (e.g. ability to have interests, plan for the future, having a soul). Animals are probably at greater risk of \u2018failing\u2019 these tests for moral status, and consequently killing or eating them may not be morally significant.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/at-what-cost-carnivory/#note-356-10\"><span>10</span></a></p>\n<p>The usual utilitarian reply to these sorts of cases is to appeal to the (very negative) second order effects as prohibitive.\u00a0<em>In reality</em>\u00a0killing someone does some injury to the social fabric and trust a community has, would be awful PR for the \u2019cause\u2019, has a high probability of going wrong, among many other costs. Many utilitarians are \u2018rule\u2019-utilitarians for these reasons: it may well be the case that members of society pre-commiting to following certain rules may lead to greater overall utility, than a society where agents contravene commonly-held norms because the judge the expected outcome to be greater.\u00a0<a title=\"There is more that can be said. An objector could turn the screw by offering caveats to the thought experiment (or just sufficient offset) that the harm of killing is genuinely outweighed by the benefits \u2013 yet, they insist, doing so would still be wrong. Although borderline question-begging, an objector might think the utilitarian gloss as to why \u2018killing offsets\u2019 are immoral is insipid, and the real reasoning should rely on the intrinsic immorality of killing. I think consequentialists should ultimately yield \u2013 these are costs to the theory, and the best that can be hoped for is to amelliorate these (one could appeal to saying ones intuitions in a sufficiently caveated case are unreliable may be one approach). It would be remarkable if a moral theory on reflection accorded with all of our moral intuitions all the time. Instead of defending the difficultly defensible, it is perhaps better to appeal that the balance of benefits of costs of consequentialism does better than other theories, notwithstanding its poor performance in these particular cases.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/at-what-cost-carnivory/#note-356-11\"><span>11</span></a>\u00a0These effects diminish the more generally acceptable something is: the true cost for \u2018offsetting\u2019 murder may be vastly more than the object-level of a single life, the true cost for offsetting eating meat, which most members of society do anyway, may fall very close to the object-level costs.</p>\n<p><em>Lots</em>\u00a0of our actions cause animal harm and death, whether through carbon emissions from non-essential activity, roadkill due to transport of goods, small animals in fields which harvested, or crushing insects when we walk around.

Where veganism falls in this spectrum depends on the particular non-consequentialist concerns being offered, how they interact with precisely what is being done to the animals in question.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Summary\">Summary</h1>\n<p>Very optimistic estimates for the effectiveness of animal welfare causes is\u00a0<em>prima facie</em>inconsistent with a great concern for personal dietary change. Given the small donations required to give an equivalent amount of benefit to personally becoming vegan, focusing on this seems an ineffective use of energy. Far easier (for both advocate and advocatee) to give fairly token donations to animal charities, which do a lot more good.</p>\n<p>This essay explored means of bringing these commitments into reflective equilibrium: adjusting the estimate for animal charities down, or personal veganism up, or appealing to non-consequentialist concerns that make stopping consumption of animal products morally imperative despite the modest benefits. I favour a significant downward adjustment of the effectiveness of animal charity effectiveness. Besides bringing the figures of vegan offset closer to sanity, one should expect winner\u2019s curse, reference class reversion and other effects to take orders of magnitude from the point estimates (<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/\">unbiased though they are</a>). If the cost to offset veganism is one hundred times higher than the estimates, then it becomes a much more desirable addition to one\u2019s altruistic behaviour given the non-monetary costs of dietary change. I think this 100 fold adjustment is about right, and if anything might still be slightly optimistic.</p>\n<p>There are interesting sequelae for those who favour different resolutions. If one takes a high view of the importance of second order effects of veganism (intra-EA or not), this implies that precise efforts to quantify the first order effects is less important, and the appeal to their size disingenuous. If one thinks one should be vegan because it can be \u2018additional\u2019 to our other altruistic actions, or it is mandated by non-consequentialist reasons, a fuller account is needed to decide which circumstances (if any) one can knowingly cause harm, and thus which actions out of all of those available are ruled out.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This is a follow-on from\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/dont-sweat-diet/\">an earlier attempt</a>. The more involved discussion of non-consequentialist approaches I owe to comments on fb and the EA forum in general, and to Carl Shulman\u2019s helpful remarks in particular.\u00a0</li>\n<li>There is one significant complication: generally these interventions \u2018work\u2019 by preventing farmed animals coming into existence in the first place. This may be a bad thing if you are optimistic that farmed animals generally have lives which are on balance worth living, despite their suffering. More exotically, even if you are pessimistic about farmed animals having lives worth living, this may be a good thing if you are even\u00a0<em>more\u00a0</em>pessimistic about wild animals having lives worth living, as farmed animals could\u00a0<a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/vegan-advocacy-and-pessimism-about-wild.html\">displace wild animals who suffer even worse lives</a>.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Hurford offers the following comparators:\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Giving up beef is ~2.1x as important as giving up dairy.<br>Giving up beef is ~1.9x as important as giving up turkey.<br>Giving up pork is ~2.9x as important as giving up beef.<br>Giving up chicken meat is ~11.3x as important as giving up beef.<br>Giving up eggs is ~11.8x as important as giving up beef.<br>Giving up aquacultured fish is ~6.4x as important as giving up beef.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can use these multiples to put everything in terms of \u2018dairy units\u2019, and thus calculate the fraction of harm caused by particular diets:</p>\n<pre>Dairy = 1\nBeef = 2.1\nTurkey = 1.1 (2.1/1.9)\nPork = 6.1 (2.1*2.9)\nChicken = 23.7 (11.3*2.1)\nEggs = 24.8 (11.8*2.1)\nFish = 13.4\nTOTAL = 72.2\n\nFraction of harm (Full diet = 1, Vegan = 0):\n\nVegetarianism = Dairy+eggs/total\n= (1 + 24.8)/72.2\n= 35.7%\n\nLactovegetarianism = Dairy/total\n= 1/72.2\n= 1.4%</pre>\n</li>\n<li>Another benefit is this will implicitly cover all impacts of reducing animal products, which may be important for those worried about the environmental impacts.\u00a0</li>\n<li>This isn\u2019t perfectly conservative: data on \u2018how long do people stay vegan\u2019 is extrapolated from \u2018how long do people who limit animal products continue limiting\u2019, and I\u2019d speculate vegans might have higher rates of attrition than vegetarians. That said, the other adjusts are probably conservative.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Despite my\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/dont-sweat-diet/\">original post</a>, I\u2019m less interested in moral offsetting as such. On thoroughgoing consequentialism, offsetting makes little sense. Either the \u2018offset charity\u2019 is the best way to spend your money or it isn\u2019t. If the former, you should donate to it anyway; if the latter, it would be better to give the offsetting money to the better cause. Perhaps better to use the \u2018cost of veganism\u2019 comparisons as a metric for comparing different moral behaviours, without demanding explicit offsetting. If being vegan is much more challenging than earning an extra hundred dollars, working on the latter seems a much better strategy.\u00a0</li>\n<li>As Carl notes elsewhere, the current vegetarian and vegan population being of a significant size\u00a0<a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/p3/dont_sweat_diet/5g7\">speaks against really big second order effects.</a>\u00a0Even on an exponential growth model, the present size of the vegan and vegetarian movement speaks against very fast growth rates, and a high expected \u2018R0\u2019 for being a vegan.\u00a0</li>\n<li>But note this consideration can easily flip the other way, especially in the case of milk given how cheap it is to offset \u2013 if vegan substitutes for milk cost a tiny amount more, it becomes better to just drink cow milk and donate the cost savings.\u00a0</li>\n<li>One may worry about other adverse consequences of direct moral offsetting, as it might be a hurdle towards dramatic social change in attitudes towards animals. Yet the sign of this effect is unclear \u2013 a wider recognition that eating animals is something that demands moral compensation may be important, and might be spread more easily if \u2018buy-in\u2019 is small donations rather than dietary change. Further, if one thinks consequentialising is good, widespread use of these things might be good too.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Although it is perhaps worth noting non-consequentialist moral theories might assign moral status on non-welfarist grounds (e.g. ability to have interests, plan for the future, having a soul). Animals are probably at greater risk of \u2018failing\u2019 these tests for moral status, and consequently killing or eating them may not be morally significant.\u00a0</li>\n<li>There is more that can be said. An objector could turn the screw by offering caveats to the thought experiment (or just sufficient offset) that the harm of killing is genuinely outweighed by the benefits \u2013 yet, they insist, doing so would still be wrong. Although borderline question-begging, an objector might think the utilitarian gloss as to why \u2018killing offsets\u2019 are immoral is insipid, and the real reasoning should rely on the intrinsic immorality of killing.\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I think consequentialists should ultimately yield \u2013 these are costs to the theory, and the best that can be hoped for is to amelliorate these (one could appeal to saying ones intuitions in a sufficiently caveated case are unreliable may be one approach). It would be remarkable if a moral theory on reflection accorded with all of our moral intuitions all the time.

But why? - you say.</p>\n<p>Clarity, precision, I am tempted to reply. <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/h2g/catching_up_with_the_present_from_the_developing/\">I have left the intellectual suburbs of Brazil</a>, straight into the strongest hub of production of things that matter, The Bay Area, via Oxford\u2019s FHI office, I now split my time between UC Berkeley, and the CFAR/MIRI office. In the process, I have navigated <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/h3f/drowning_in_an_information_ocean/\">an ocean of information</a>, read hundreds of books, papers, saw thousands of classes, became proficient in a handful of languages and a handful of intellectual disciplines. I\u2019ve visited the Olympus and I met our living demigods in person as well.</p>\n<p>Against the overwhelming forces of an extremely upbeat personality surfing a hyper base-level happiness, these three forces: approaching the center, learning voraciously, and meeting the so-called heroes, have brought me to the current state of pessimism.</p>\n<p>I was a transhumanist, an immortalist, and an effective altruist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why_I_Grew_Skeptical_of_Transhumanism\">Why I Grew Skeptical of Transhumanism</h2>\n<p>The transhumanist in me is skeptical of technological development fast enough for improving the human condition to be worth it now, he sees most technologies as fancy toys that don\u2019t get us there. Our technologies can\u2019t and won\u2019t for a while lead our minds to peaks anywhere near the peaks we found by simply introducing weirdly shaped molecules into our brains. The strangeness of Salvia, the beauty of LSD, the love of MDMA are orders and orders of magnitude beyond what we know how to change from an engineering perspective. We can induce a rainbow, but we don\u2019t even have the concept of force yet. Our knowledge about the brain, given our goals about the brain, is at the level of knowledge of physics of someone who found out that spraying water on a sunny day causes the rainbow. It\u2019s not even physics yet.</p>\n<p>Believe me, I have read thousands of pages of papers in the most advanced topics in cognitive neuroscience, my advisor spent his entire career, from Harvard to Tenure, doing neuroscience, and was the first person to implant neurons that actually healed a brain to the point of recovering functionality by using non-human neurons. As Marvin Minsky, who nearly invented AI and the multi-agent computational theory of mind, told me: I don\u2019t recommend entering a field where every four years all knowledge is obsolete, they just don\u2019t know it yet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why_I_Grew_Skeptical_of_Immortalism\">Why I Grew Skeptical of Immortalism</h2>\n<p>The immortalist in me is skeptical because he understands the complexity of biology from conversations with the centimillionaires and with the chief scientists of anti-aging research facilities worldwide, he met the bio-startup founders and gets that the structure of incentives does not look good for bio-startups anyway, so although he was once very excited about the prospect of defeating the mechanisms of ageing, back when less than 300 thousand dollars were directly invested in it, he is now, with billions pledged against ageing, confident that the problem is substantially harder to surmount than the number of man-hours left to be invested in the problem, at least during my lifetime, or before the Intelligence Explosion.</p>\n<p>Believe me, I was the first cryonicist among the 200 million people striding my country, won a prize for anti-ageing research at the bright young age of 17, and hang out on a regular basis with all the people in this world who want to beat death that still share in our privilege of living, just in case some new insight comes that changes the tides, but none has come in the last ten years, as our friend Aubrey will be keen to tell you in detail.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why_I_Grew_Skeptical_of_Effective_Altruism\">Why I Grew Skeptical of Effective Altruism</h2>\n<p>The Effective Altruist is skeptical too, although less so, I\u2019m still founding an EA <a href=\"http://convergenceanalysis.org/\">research institute</a>, keeping a loving eye on <a href=\"http://www.ierfh.org/br/index.html\">the one</a> I left behind, living with EAs, working at EA offices and mostly <a href=\"/ea/ky/introducing_moral_economics/\">broadcasting ideas</a> and researching with EAs. Here are some problems with EA which make me skeptical after being shook around by the three forces:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Status Games:</strong> Signalling, countersignalling, going one more meta-level up, outsmarting your opponent, seeing others as opponents, my cause is the only true cause, zero-sum mating scarcity, pretending that poly eliminates mating scarcity, founders X joiners, researchers X executives, us institutions versus them institutions, <a href=\"/ea/lg/direct_funding_between_eas_moral_economics/\">cheap individuals versus expensive institutional salaries</a>, it's gore all the way up and down.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reasoning by Analogy:</strong> Few EAs are able to and doing their due intellectual diligence. I don\u2019t blame them, the space of Crucial Considerations is not only very large, but extremely uncomfortable to look at, who wants to know our species has not even found the stepping stones to make sure that what matters is preserved and guaranteed at the end of the day? It is a hefty ordeal. Nevertheless, it is problematic that fewer than 20 EAs (one in 300?) are actually <a href=\"/ea/9l/types_of_planners_and_plans_for_eas/\">reasoning from first principles</a>, thinking all things through from the very beginning. Most of us are looking away from at least some philosophical assumption or technological prediction. Most of us are <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html\">cooks and not yet chefs</a>. Some of us have <a href=\"http://diegocaleiro.com/2013/07/08/first-challenge-stop-learning-start-doing/\">not even</a> waken up <a href=\"https://brainstormers.wordpress.com/2010/10/18/altruistic-awesomeness-your-challenge/\">yet</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Babies with a Detonator:</strong> Most EAs still carry their transitional objects around, clinging desperately to an idea or a person they think more guaranteed to be true, be it hardcore patternism about philosophy of mind, global aggregative utilitarianism, veganism, or the expectation of immortality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Size of the Problem:</strong> No matter if you are fighting suffering, Nature, Chronos (death), Azathoth (evolutionary forces) or <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">Moloch</a> (deranged emergent structures of incentives), the size of the problem is just tremendous. One completely ordinary reason to not want to face the problem, or to be in denial, is the problem\u2019s enormity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Complexity of The Solution:</strong> Let me spell this out, the nature of the solution is <a href=\"http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=968ae168b3e22eecb9d4db530a426959\">not simple</a> in the least. It\u2019s possible that we luck out and it turns out the Orthogonality Thesis and the Doomsday Argument and Mind Crime are just philosophical curiosities that have no practical bearing in our earthly engineering efforts, that the AGI or Emulation will by default fall into an attractor basin which implements some form of MaxiPok with details that it only grasps after CEV or the Crypto, and we will be Ok. It is possible, and it is more likely than that our efforts will end up being the decisive factor. We need to focus our actions in the branches where they matter though.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Nature of the Solution:</strong> So let\u2019s sit down side by side and stare at the void together for a bit. The nature of the solution is getting a group of apes who just invented the internet from everywhere around the world, and get them to coordinate an effort that fills in the entire box of Crucial Considerations yet unknown - this is the goal of <a href=\"http://convergenceanalysis.org/\">Convergence Analysis</a>, by the way - find every single last one of them to the point where the box is filled, then, once we have all the Crucial Considerations available, develop, faster than anyone else trying, a translation scheme that translates our values to a machine or emulation, in a physically sound and technically robust way (that\u2019s if we don\u2019t find a Crucial Consideration otherwise which, say, steers our course towards Mars). Then we need to develop the engineering prerequisites to implement a thinking being smarter than all our scientists together who can reflect philosophically better than the last two thousand years of effort while becoming the most powerful entity in the universe\u2019s history, that will fall into the right attractor basin within mindspace. That\u2019s if Superintelligences are even possible technically. Add to that we or it have to guess correctly all the philosophical problems that are A)Relevant B)Unsolvable <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/r0/thou_art_physics/\">within physics</a> (if any) or by computers, all of this has to happen while the most powerful corporations, States, armies and individuals attempt to seize control of the smart systems themselves. without being curtailed by the hindrance counter incentive of not destroying the world either because they don\u2019t realize it, or because the first mover advantage seems worth the risk, or because they are about to die anyway so there\u2019s not much to lose.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How Large an Uncertainty:</strong> Our uncertainties loom large. We have <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/\">some technical </a>but not much philosophical understanding of suffering, and our technical understanding is insufficient to confidently assign moral status to other entities, specially if they diverge in more dimensions than brain size and architecture. We\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of <a href=\"http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=b48ed8ac6c904fe2c646033934d19720\">technical understanding</a> on happiness increase, and <a href=\"http://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedonist.htm\">philosophical understanding</a> is also in its first steps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Macrostrategy is Hard:</strong> A Chess Grandmaster usually takes many years to acquire sufficient strategic skill to command the title. It takes a <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2014/05/14/machine-intelligence-and-capital-accumulation/\">deep</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html\">profound</a> understanding of <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">unfolding</a> structures to grasp how to beam a message or a change into the future. We are attempting to beam a complete value lock-in in the right basin, which is proportionally harder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Probabilistic Reasoning = Reasoning by Analogy</strong>: We need a community that at once understands probability theory, doesn\u2019t play reference class tennis, and doesn\u2019t lose motivation by considering the base rates of other people trying to do something, because the other people <a href=\"http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html\">were cooks, not chefs</a>, and also because sometimes you actually need to try a one in ten thousand chance. But people are too proud of their command of Bayes to let go of the easy chance of showing off their ability to find mathematically sound reasons not to try.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Excessive Trust in Institutions:</strong> Very often people go through a simplifying set of assumptions that collapses a brilliant idea into an awful donation, when they reason:<br>I have concluded that cause X is the most relevant<br>Institution A is an EA organization fighting for cause X<br>Therefore I donate to institution A to fight for cause X. <br>To begin with, this is very expensive compared to donating to any of the three P\u2019s: projects, <a href=\"/ea/lg/direct_funding_between_eas_moral_economics/\">people</a> or prizes. Furthermore, the crucial points to fund institutions are when they are about to die, just starting, or building a type of momentum that has a narrow window of opportunity where the derivative gains are particularly large or you have private information about their current value. To agree with you about a cause being important is far from sufficient to assess the expected value of your donation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Delusional Optimism:</strong> Everyone who like past-me moves in with delusional optimism will always have a blind spot in the feature of reality about which they are in denial. It is not a problem to have some <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/67z/out_of_the_closet_as_a_positive_utilitarian/\">individuals with a blind spot</a>, as long as the rate doesn\u2019t surpass some group sanity threshold, yet, on an individual level, it is often the case that those who can gaze into the void a little longer than the rest end up being the ones who accomplish things. Staring into the void makes people show up.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Convergence of opinions may strengthen separation within EA:</strong> \u00a0Thus far, the longer someone is an EA for, the more likely they are to transition to an opinion in the subsequent boxes <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/jQhoQOZ.png\"><em>in this flowchart from whichever box they are at at the time</em></a>. There are still people in all the opinion boxes, but the trend has been to move in that flow. Institutions however have a harder time escaping being locked into a specific opinion. As FHI moves deeper into AI, and GWWC into poverty, 80k into career selection etc\u2026 they become more congealed. People\u2019s opinions are still changing, and some of the money follows, but institutions are crystallizing into some opinions, and in the future they might prevent transition between opinion clusters and free mobility of individuals, like national frontiers already do. Once institutions, which in theory are commanded by people who agree with institutional values, notice that their rate of loss towards the EA movement is higher than their rate of gain, they will have incentives to prevent the flow of talent, ideas and resources that has so far been a hallmark of Effective Altruism and why many of us find it impressive, it\u2019s being <a href=\"/ea/j7/effective_altruism_as_an_intensional_movement/\">an intensional movement</a>. Any part that congeals or becomes extensional will drift off behind, and this may create unsurmountable separation between groups that want to claim \u2018EA\u2019 for themselves.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Only_Game_in_Town\">Only Game in Town</h2>\n<p>The reasons above have transformed a pathological optimist into a wary skeptical about our future, and the value of our plans to get there. And yet, I don\u2019t see other option than to continue the battle. I wake up in the morning and consider my alternatives: Hedonism, well, that is fun for a while, and I could try a quantitative approach to guarantee maximal happiness over the course of the 300 000 hours I have left. But all things considered, anyone reading this is already too close to the epicenter of something that can become extremely important and change the world to have the affordance to wander off indeterminately. I look at my high base-happiness and don\u2019t feel justified in maximizing it up to the point of no marginal return, there clearly is value elsewhere than here (points inwards), clearly the self of which I am made has strong altruistic urges anyway, so at least above a threshold of happiness, has reason to purchase the extremely good deals in expected value happiness of others that seem to be on the market. Other alternatives? Existentialism? Well, yes, we always have a fundamental choice and I feel the thrownness into this world as much as any Kierkegaard does. Power? When we read Nietzsche it gives that fantasy impression that power is really interesting and worth fighting for, but at the end of the day we still live in a universe where the wealthy are often reduced to having to spend their power in pathetic signalling games and zero sum disputes or coercing minds to act against their will. Nihilism and Moral Fictionalism, like Existentialism all collapse into having a choice, and if I have a choice my choice is always going to be the choice to, most of the time, care, try and do.</p>\n<p>Ideally, I am still a transhumanist and an immortalist. But in practice, I have abandoned those noble ideals, and pragmatically only continue to be an EA.</p>\n<p>It is the only game in town.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/n0e/the_growth_of_my_pessimism_transhumanism/#comments\">Most comments are on Lesswrong</a>.\u00a0</p></div></div>"},

If you\u2019re interested in exploring these, email your CV to </span><a href=\"mailto:tog.ash@gmail.com\"><span>tog.ash@gmail.com</span></a><span>. This post describes my experience doing an internship with .impact over this summer. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span><span>Overall, I found my internship at .impact to be an interesting and rewarding learning experience. Since the people most heavily involved with .impact have so much work to be done, there is considerable freedom in choosing what you would like to do. For example, I quickly found that I enjoyed editing, so this became a large portion of what I was assigned. </span></p>\n<p><span>Another advantage of the large amount of work to be done at .impact is that there is essentially no cap on the number of hours you can volunteer. For example, if you have a free weekend, you can spend all day volunteering. Additionally, since there are few hard deadlines, there is considerable flexibility regarding when you can work. I found this extremely helpful as I didn\u2019t have to worry about missing a day or two, provided I made up the time later in the week. Typically, interns are expected to make a firm minimum weekly commitment, however this commitment can be as low as a few hours per week.</span></p>\n<p><span>Another aspect that sets an internship at .impact apart is that when you work here, you feel like you are working with them rather than for them. Within a week or two after I had started, I felt like I was part of the team, and that my input was as important as anyone else\u2019s. Furthermore, many people working at or affiliated with .impact reached out to me during the first weeks of my internship, and I felt welcomed. Additionally, most employees and volunteers at .impact are younger, which, for me as a high school student, made them a lot less intimidating.</span></p>\n<p><span>As mentioned earlier, there is a wide variety of work to choose from. Some of my tasks included coordinating group meetups, editing research reports, and doing my own research on practical topics, to name but a few. I also had a number of smaller recurring assignments, such as creating weekly facebook events. All tasks are neatly listed on the website Asana with a description of what to do and a (usually rough) deadline. This is fantastic if you\u2019re as disorganized as me, and also fantastic if you\u2019re organized and like everything in one place.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you're interested, here are a few tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Tom Ash uses a lot of different websites to coordinate projects. During my time, Asana and Slack were both adopted by .impact for task management and communication respectively. These websites are extremely useful, so make sure you learn how to use them.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Don\u2019t be afraid to send an email if you\u2019re confused about an assignment; everyone\u2019s very friendly.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li><span>Familiarize yourself with Google Docs/Spreadsheets. A large portion of my work was done using these.</span></li>\n</ul></div></div>"},

The last round is going to be significantly simplified, both for applicants and for us. Here\u2019s how it will work:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sellers may submit a one-sentence description of what they did, an optional link, and a price at which they would be willing to \"sell\" some portion of the impact. This process should take only a few minutes.</li>\n<li>We may ask further questions or further investigate the particular projects that we are most likely to purchase.</li>\n<li>We, or other buyers, will accept some of the offers made in step [1]. If a price is attractive but not quite good enough then we may make a counteroffer, and haggling may ensue. The offers in step [1] aren't formally binding, so the seller can still back out (though we'd appreciate if you don't, since doing so wastes time).</li>\n</ol>\n<div>If you want to submit an offer, you can either make a comment on this post, or fill out the form <a href=\"http://goo.gl/forms/pJBdVM6QuZ\">here</a>.

We realized that trying to be incentive-compatible made the process <em>much </em>more expensive, for both us and the sellers. \u00a0We also realized that the incentives were never going to be perfect or even great, once we had a dynamic process with more than one buyer.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>My guess is that blog posts (or other relatively self-contained writings) are the most promising candidates; I recommend a low bar for quickly submitting a link and a high-ball estimate for the value of a post, as long as you won't be offended when we don't fund it.\u00a0</div>\n<p>As always, our evaluations will be unapologetically arbitrary, rough, and biased.</p>\n<div>The deadline for submissions is Sunday December 20.</div></div></div>"},
{"date": "16th Dec 2015", "title": "Is legacy fundraising actually higher leverage?", "author": "Benjamin_Todd", "num_comments": "17 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>It's often been pointed out that legacy fundraising (asking people to make a commitment to give in their will) has a much higher return than other types of fundraising.</p>\n<p>On average, $1 spent fundraising raises about $4.</p>\n<p>$1 spent on legacy fundraising, however, raises about $30.</p>\n<p>This is taken to be a reason to focus more on legacy fundraising.</p>\n<p>However, it just struck me that this is wrong. (Apologies if this point has already been made elsewhere).</p>\n<p>With legacy donations, you only get the money a long way in the future. If you persuade someone who's 40 with a life expectancy of 80, you'll get it in about 40 years. If you persuade someone who's 20, you'll get it in about 60 years, or perhaps longer. With normal fundraising, you get the money pretty fast - often nearly immediately, or otherwise over a couple of years.</p>\n<div>Money in the future is less valuable, so legacy commitments are less valuable.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Let's quantify the effect. Rather than getting a legacy commitment, you could raise money now and invest it in the stock market. If you do that, you could grow it at about 5% per year (real returns).</div>\n<p>$1 invested in short-run fundraising generates $4.</p>\n<p>Then $4 invested at 5% for 40 years will be worth $28.</p>\n<p>And that's about $30 - what you would have got from the legacy commitment.</p>\n<p>So it looks like the extra returns of legacy fundraising are fully explained by the fact that you have to wait a long time for the money. It isn't actually a more attractive method of fundraising.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Moreover, there's reasons individual effective altruists and organisations might want to use a discount rate even higher than 5%. If you do that, or if you raise legacy commitments from people under 40, legacy fundraising is going to be substantially less attractive than regular fundraising.</p></div></div>"},

Imagine how great it feels to know that you\u2019re making the most difference with your gift. Yet how do you figure out how to bring about this outcome? Maximizing the impact of your money requires being </span><a href=\"http://intentionalinsights.org/video-3-steps-to-living-intentionally\">intentional</a><span> and strategic with your giving.</span></p>\n<p><span>Let me share my personal perspective on giving intentionally. I am really passionate about using an evidence-based approach to do the most good with my donations. I take the time to research causes so that my money and time go to the best charities possible. Moreover, I have taken the </span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/join/\"><span>Giving What We Can</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/take-the-pledge\"><span>The Life You Can Save</span></a><span> pledges to dedicate a sizable chunk of my income to effective charities. It felt great to take those pledges, and to commit publicly to effective giving throughout my life.</span></p>\n<p><span>I am proud to identify as an </span><a href=\"http://eahub.org/user/gleb-tsipursky\"><span>effective altruist</span></a><span>: a member of a </span><a href=\"http://www.effectivealtruism.org/\"><span>movement</span></a><span> dedicated to </span><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism?language=en\"><span>combining the heart and the head</span></a><span>, using research and science to empower the urges of my emotional desire to make the world a better place. I pay close attention to data-driven charity evaluators such as </span><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\"><span>GiveWell</span></a><span>. The large majority of effective altruists closely follow its guidance. GiveWell focuses on charities that do direct activities to improve human life and alleviating suffering and have a clearly measurable </span><span><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Impact-Calculator\">impact</a>. One</span><span>\u00a0example is\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/\"><span>Against Malaria Foundation</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/\"><span>(AMF)</span></a><span>, one of The Life You Can Save's recommended charities and one of four of GiveWell\u2019s </span><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/11/18/our-updated-top-charities-for-giving-season-2015/\"><span>top choice</span></a><span>\u00a0charities for 2015.</span></p>\n<p><span>Yet while I give to AMF, it and other highly effective charities represent only a small fraction of my donated time and money. This might sound surprising coming from an effective altruist. Why don\u2019t I conform to the standard practice of most effective altruists and donate all of my money and time to these effective, research-based, well-proven charities?</span></p>\n<p><span>First, let me say that I agree with most effective altruists that reducing poverty via highly effective charities that work directly on poverty alleviation is very worthwhile, and I do make donations to highly effective charities. In fact, this morning I donated enough money for AMF to buy two mosquito bed nets to protect families from malaria-carrying mosquitoes. I certainly got positive feelings from knowing that my gift will go directly towards saving lives, and have a very clear and measurable impact on the world</span></p>\n<p><span>Yet when I make large or systematic contributions of money and time, effective charity is not where I give. I don't think donating to these direct-action charities is the best use of my own money and time. After all, my goal is to save lives and maximize cash flow to effective charities, whether or not I\u2019m </span><span>personally</span><span> giving money to effective organizations. To evaluate the impulses coming from my heart to ensure that my actions match </span><a href=\"http://intentionalinsights.org/video-3-steps-to-getting-what-you-want\"><span>my actual goals</span></a><span>, I take the time to sit down and consult my head.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gcc9FPtpB_yDBs2Qng7YcNzI0bqTRNT6opKE1Ytj5WQjpRnzcMbU7GfTjn4P1q95eEt4JPqy7HlsCPd8m_07CF_OOVDQBw7ga0YsFWv-VmMFV3nA6Lf2QNTImLnllKLlxlYuZe5A\" alt=\"http://stephenpoff.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Hamlet-Skull-profile-lo-res.jpg\"></span></p>\n<p><span>(</span><a href=\"http://stephenpoff.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Hamlet-Skull-profile-lo-res.jpg\"><span>image credit</span></a><span>)</span></p>\n<p><span>I use rational decision-making strategies such as a </span><a href=\"http://www.hsor.org/what_is_or.cfm?name=mutli-attribute_utility_theory\"><span>MAUT analysis</span></a><span> to evaluate where my giving would make the most difference in getting resources to effective charities. As a result, I have spent the majority of my money and time on higher-level, strategic giving that channels other people\u2019s donations towards more effective charities, facilitating many more donations to them than I alone could provide.</span></p>\n<p><span>This is why I am passionate about contributing to the kind of projects that spread widely the message of effective giving. Doing so doesn\u2019t necessarily involve getting other people to become part of the effective altruist movement. Instead, it prompts them to adapt effective giving strategies such as taking the time to list their goals for giving, consider their giving budgets, research the best charities, and use data-based charity evaluators to choose the optimal charity that matches their giving goals.</span></p>\n<p><span>What does spreading these messages involve? Since there are few organizations devoted to spreading effective giving strategies to a broad audience, I decided to practice </span><a href=\"/ea/pi/why_charity_entrepreneurship/\"><span>charity entrepreneurship</span></a><span>. Together with my wife, I co-founded a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization devoted to spreading effective giving and rational thinking strategies, </span><a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/Intentional-Insights-Spreading-Effective-Altruism-Effectively-to-Broad-Audiences-UTiM2viNkrp\"><span>Intentional Insights</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/Intentional-Insights-Spreading-Effective-Altruism-Effectively-to-Broad-Audiences-UTiM2viNkrp\"><span>(InIn)</span></a><span>. InIn creates content devoted to this purpose, for example this article about how </span><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gleb-tsipursky/how-to-avoid-feeling-chea_b_8635224.html\"><span>I became an effective altruist</span></a><span> in the first place. Such articles, published in the organization\u2019s own blog and places such as</span><span>\u00a0the<em> Huffington Post</em></span><span> and </span><span>Lifehack</span><span>, are shared widely online, and reach hundreds of thousands of readers. For example, a recent </span><a href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/author/gleb-tsipursky\"><span>Lifehack article I published</span></a><span> was shared over 2.5 thousand times on social media. A widely-used general estimate is that for every 1 person who shares an article, 100 people read an article thoroughly, while many more skim it. </span><br><span>Plenty of people follow the links back to the organizations mentioned in the articles I publish, including organizations devoted to effective giving when the article deals with that topic.</span></p>\n<p><span>For some, a single article that makes a strong enough case is sufficient to sway their thinking. For example, I published an\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://s.bl-1.com/h/tJSp0Gd?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gleb-tsipursky/how-to-avoid-feeling-chea_b_8635224.html\">article in The Huffington Post</a> that combines an engaging narrative, emotions, and a rational argument to promote giving to effective charities as opposed to ineffective ones. This article explicitly highlighted the benefits of Against Malaria Foundation, GiveWell's top choice for 2015. On a higher, meta level, it encouraged giving to effective charities, and using GiveWell and The Life You Can Save, including its <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Impact-Calculator\">Impact Calculator</a>, to make decisions about giving. As you'll see from this Facebook comment on my personal page, it <a href=\"http://s.bl-1.com/h/tJSp5gg?url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1079797162070769&amp;id=468695349847623\">helped convince someone</a> to decide to donate to an effective charity. Furthermore, this comment is someone who is the leader of a large secular group in Houston, and he thus has an impact on a number of other people. Since people rarely make actual comments, and far from all are fans of my Facebook page, we can estimate that many more made similar decisions but chose not to comment about it. In fact, the article was shared quite widely on social media, so it made quite some impact, and still going - the StumbleUpon clicks went from 50ish to 980ish in the last several days, for example.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>However, others need more than a single article. I place myself in that number - I generally want significant exposure to ideas and shift my mind gradually. Or perhaps the initial articles I read did not make a strong enough case. In any event, like many others, I first discovered the idea of effective giving through an article, and followed the breadcrumbs in the links to GiveWell, Giving What We Can, The Life You Can Save, and other similar organizations. I was then intrigued enough to go to a presentation about it given by </span><a href=\"http://intentionalinsights.org/raelifin\"><span>Max Harms</span></a><span>. While already oriented toward effective giving by my previous reading, the presentation sold me on effective altruism as a movement. Presentations give people a direct opportunity to engage with and consider in-depth the big questions surrounding effective giving. This is why I devote my time and money not only into writing articles, but also into promoting effective altruist-themed presentations.</span></p>\n<p><span>For example, I am collaborating with Jon Behar from The Life You Can Save to spread </span><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Giving-Games\"><span>Giving Games</span></a><span>. This participatory presentation educates the audience about effective giving by providing all participants with a pool of actual money, $10 per attendee, and has them discuss fundamental questions about where to give that money. In the course of the Giving Game, participants explore their values and motivations for donations, what kind of evidence they should use to evaluate charities, and how to avoid thinking errors in their giving. After the discussion, the group votes which charity should get the money. The Life You Can Save then donates that money on behalf of the group.</span></p>\n<p><span>InIn has strong connections with reason-oriented organizations due to our focus on spreading rational thinking, and is partnering with The Life You Can Save to bring the Giving Game to these organizations, starting with the </span><a href=\"https://secularstudents.org/about\"><span>Secular Student Alliance</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"https://secularstudents.org/about\"><span>(SSA)</span></a><span>. The SSA is an international organization uniting hundreds of reason-oriented student clubs around the world, but mainly in the United States. I proposed the idea to </span><a href=\"https://secularstudents.org/staff\"><span>August Brunsman</span></a><span>, the Executive Director of the SSA and a member of the InIn Advisory Board. He himself is passionate about promoting social justice, but had little familiarity with Effective Altruism. I told him more about Effective Altruism and the Giving Game model, and he and other SSA staff members decided to approve the event. Together, InIn and The Life You Can Save created a Giving Game event </span><a href=\"https://secularstudents.org/givinggame\"><span>specifically targeted to SSA clubs</span></a><span>, and the SSA is now actively promoting the Giving Game to its members.</span></p>\n<p><span>I am delighted with this outcome. As a former member President of a SSA club, I can attest that my past self would have been very eager to host this type of event. Looking back, I would have greatly benefitted from taking the time to sit down, discuss, and reflect seriously on my giving in a context where my decision had real-world consequences. This is the type of activity that would have strongly impacted my thinking and behavior around donations going forward. The Life You Can Save has dedicated $10,000 to its initial pilot program for SSA members, and has promised to fundraise more if it works out, but at least 1000 students will participate in these games as a result of the collaboration between InIn and The Life You Can Save.</span></p>\n<p><span>How much impact will this have on the world? I cannot say for sure. I do not have the kind of carefully defined measures of impact that GiveWell can provide for direct-action charities. Indeed, it is really difficult to measure the actual impact of any marketing efforts. The best we can do is to build chains of evidence. For example, </span><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Blog/ID/181/How-Sponsoring-Giving-Games-Can-Multiply-the-Impact-of-Your-Donations\"><span>this article</span></a><span> that suggests a powerful long-term impact of donations to support Giving Games. Such estimates apply more broadly to contributions that promote effective giving to the public.</span></p>\n<p><span>Sure, it is hard to know for sure the exact effects that my efforts spreading the message of effective giving has on the world. Yet when I sit down and think about it, and make my decisions rationally, I am very happy to dedicate my large donations, my monthly giving, as well as my systematic volunteer efforts to publicizing the message of effective giving. While it does not get me the same warm feelings as giving to direct action charities, when I use my head to direct my heart I realize that sponsoring such activities makes the most difference to maximizing donations to effective charities.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><br><span>P.S. </span><span>This article is part of the </span><a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/EA-Marketing-Resource-Bank-Rq2ckmtIxUY\"><span>EA Marketing Resource Bank</span></a><span> project lead by </span><a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/Intentional-Insights-UTiM2viNkrp\"><span>Intentional Insights</span></a><span> and the </span><a href=\"http://dotimpact.im/focusprojects/lean/\"><span>Local Effective Altruism Network</span></a><span>, with support from </span><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\"><span>The Life You Can Save</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n</div></div></div>"},
{"date": "28th Oct 2015", "title": "What Makes the New Atheists So Charitable?", "author": "kierangreig", "num_comments": "2 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span>Authors: Joey Savoie and Tee Barnett</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Before getting to know your local atheist, it\u2019s very much worth rehashing the ABCs of non-belief that run the risk of remaining little known, especially now that the skeptic community has become more interested and active in charitable causes. Public intellectuals frequenting bestseller lists on our behalf are swift to go on the offensive, but there\u2019s something to be said for shoring up the defense as well. A real uneasiness toward atheists and their intentions seems to flow from a very common and endlessly parroted assumption\u2014that without belief in god, anything would be allowed. Divine reprimand and reward are ultimately credited with keeping us on the straight and narrow, and often said to have provided the moral foundation for our society. A charitable movement populated with skeptics and atheists would seem counterintuitive or even completely bananas then, but nonetheless, a number of causes under the umbrella of </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism\"><span>Effective Altruism</span></a><span> (EA) are blossoming. How do we account for this? Should we credit our learned behavior to a society built on these heavenly mandates, or is it something else?</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Spoiler alert: the answer is something else.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Whether it comes from the prosaic lips of Ivan Fyodorovitch of </span><span>The Brothers Karamazov, </span><span>in the more contemporary form of Dinesh D\u2019Souza, or confronted you recently one way or another, the common argument sees morality as having originated from the outside. Without a punishing set of external pressures imposed from up high, so it goes, mankind will naturally veer off into a wilderness of undesirable behavior. If we care to reexamine the ABCs of atheism, we could start with what Elizabeth Anderson aptly describes as the atheist commitment to \u201c</span><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1566053.The_Portable_Atheist\"><span>the expansion and growth of the human mind.</span></a><span>\u201d Of course, this might seem obnoxiously smug. Who would march against personal growth? </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Nobody</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>What Anderson is getting at is less about condescending to theists and more about illustrating where morality originates for atheists. Jean-Paul Sartre pre-empted her decades before by contending that morality </span><a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm\"><span>comes from within and grows outwardly</span></a><span>. Without wading too far into the philosophical thicket, we\u2019ll leave you with Sartre illustrating how even personal decisions can radiate outwards, \u201cIn fashioning myself I fashion man.\u201d Within each of us, overlapping and intertwining motivations help us fashion ourselves and our morals, and much of the time we would like to see the rest of the world follow suit. Have we met nudists that only want for the whole of humanity to shed these rags we affix to ourselves on the regular? Absolutely. Transplant this model onto an aversion to human suffering and now we\u2019re talking. </span></p>\n<p><span>Skepticism as Solidarity</span></p>\n<p><span>Something like this line of reasoning has been recycled and repurposed for as long as mankind has known anything. Intense personal feelings such as love, kinship and solidarity are unquestionably responsible for shaping moral values, and yet we struggle to exorcise this suspicion of non-believers. If anything, as </span><a href=\"http://infidels.org/library/modern/andrei_volkov/dostoevsky.html\"><span>Andrei Volkov points out</span></a><span>, non-believers and skeptics may have incredibly compelling reasons for caring about others. </span></p>\n<p><span>In this sense, the Effective Altruism movement, </span><a href=\"http://www.skepticsforcharity.com\"><span>largely populated by the skeptical, secular, rational, and atheistic types</span></a><span>, makes sense. The often principled and examined lives of this crowd, continually shaped and enriched by facts and new information, fit neatly within a charitable cause that are primarily evidence-based. </span><span>The utilitarian bent of the movement, which advocates doing the most good for the greatest number, appeals to nearly everyone. And the insistence on making critical decisions with evidence and reason (e.g. randomized control trials, external evaluations) would motivate nearly everyone as well, and particularly the </span><a href=\"http://skepticsforcharity.com\"><span>Skeptics For Charity</span></a><span> submovement taking shape. </span></p>\n<p><span>These developments carry practical weight when considering that Givewell, the flagship charity evaluator of the EA movement, </span><a href=\"http://files.givewell.org/files/images/website%20money%20moved%20by%20evaluators%202013.png\"><span>is now moving more money</span></a><span> than Charity Navigator. \u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.skepticsforcharity.com\"><span>Channeling science and skeptical inquiry into the most pressing problems facing humanity</span></a><span> is itself a form of activism--a desire to see our exacting taste for evidence and accountability reflected back at us in charity. We want this for others because we would want it for ourselves. The demand for others to receive the same standards as we enjoy is as real as any other cause. </span></p>\n<p><span>The same evidence and calculations used to determine the truth about our charitable efforts also reveals that we need not sacrifice our lifestyle to have an impact. Our currency has </span><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-08-31/doing-good-better-review\"><span>potentially 100x the spending power elsewhere</span></a><span> which means we can simply leverage scientific techniques to effect massive-scale social change without losing what we have. </span><span>Skeptics For Charity is currently running a pledge initiative that allows everyone to make a massive ripples in global poverty that can be found </span><a href=\"http://www.skepticsforcharity.com/donate.html\"><span>here</span></a><span>. </span><span>The adage (mis)attributed to Dostoevsky \u201cwithout belief in god, anything is permitted\u201d likely reads differently to an Effective Altruist and </span><a href=\"http://www.skepticsforcharity.com\"><span>Skeptic For Charity</span></a><span> than most. Absent the assumption of god and all the mandated morality that follows, we are freer to form a values system based on human solidarity and a commitment to ensuring that we\u2019re truly making the impact we want for others. </span></p>\n<p><span>(This article originally appeared on the Huffington Post and is cross posted here.\u00a0</span><span>Joey Savoie is the Executve Director of Charity Science and Tee is the Programs and Eduational Officer at Charity Science.)</span></p></div></div>"},

(<a href=\"http://claviger.net/even-more-reasons-for-donor-coordination.html\">Cross-posted from my blog.</a>)<br></em></p>\n<div>\n<p>At least since GiveWell\u2019s 2014 series of <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/12/02/donor-coordination-and-the-givers-dilemma/\">articles on donor coordination</a> it has been clear that donor coordination is an important project to  realize so large donors can split their funding rather than wait each  other out, and if there are thresholds to realizing a project that  neither can meet alone, they can pool\u00a0resources.</p>\n<p>But another advantage of donor coordination concerns all donors, and  in the short term especially donors who would like to donate to <span>EA</span> metacharities. To convey the idea, I need to critique my previous proposal of expected utility\u00a0auctions.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Prioritization_Research\">Prioritization\u00a0Research</h1>\n<p>Prioritization research as GiveWell and Animal Charity Evaluators conduct it combines a number of\u00a0advantages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>EAs know where they can\u00a0donate,</li>\n<li>it coordinates donors insofar as the estimates for room for more funding are updated in yearly cycles or more\u00a0often,</li>\n<li>but most importantly, it generates a cash flow to charities that is a function of their efficiency at producing positive impact:<ol>\n<li>thus linking a metric that they cannot ignore for their own sake (money) to a metric that they morally mustn\u2019t ignore\u00a0(impact),</li>\n<li>thus incentivizing less effective charities to become more effective  (and conduct and publish research to get there) to partake of that cash  flow or even to retain donors if the movement builders are  very\u00a0successful,</li>\n<li>thus creating a more efficient market for altruistic investments,  which raises the effectiveness waterline of the whole charity\u00a0sector.</li>\n</ol> </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Depending on how much money we EAs have at our disposal in the  movement, there is more or less value in the the first two points \u2013 but  the overwhelming value for the vast majority of society, the long-run  future, and moral process is in the third point. And GiveWell has reaped  all the low-hanging prioritization fruit here, so it now needs to climb  higher in the metaphorical tree (with Open Phil). (<span>ACE</span> may well have some low-hanging fruit left to\u00a0pluck.)</p>\n<p>But prioritization organizations need to also apply prioritization to  their own research. When the funding gap of a charity is so limited  that the expected value of information gained by reviewing it is lower  than the price in staff time paid for the review, conducting the review  would come at a positive opportunity cost, which translates into  suffering that could\u2019ve been averted. Hence, charities need to be  somewhat scalable to qualify for\u00a0review.</p>\n<p>In my post on expected utility auctions I explained that this leads  to a recommendation gap for smaller and more speculative opportunities,  especially now that it has been announced that <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/946573212065703/\">Open Phil is not planning to put out public recommendations</a>.  Since donors don\u2019t (and would be ill-advised to) split up their  donations arbitrarily between countless charities, they cluster around  the few safe bets that GiveWell and <span>ACE</span> have  found, and insofar as they don\u2019t, their donations are split up across  scores of smaller or more speculative endeavors, so that this support  becomes less visible. This looks like a streetlight effect but is really  quite\u00a0rational.</p>\n<p>As a remedy I proposed to lower the bar for prioritization research,  and crowdsource it to highly transparent hobbyists who can share the  responsibility for the results in a StackExchange-like\u00a0system.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Donor_Coordination\">Donor\u00a0Coordination</h1>\n<p>The value of that system needs to be divided by the months of work  that would have to go into community building to get it going and  multiplied by the probabilities that this community building effort will  be successful and that the resulting recommendations will be valuable. <span>MVP</span> versions of the system were proposed in the comments, but it would  still require a significant leap of faith for someone to drive  the\u00a0project.</p>\n<p>Instead, how about donor\u00a0coordination?</p>\n<p>The majority of the small charities that we wish to donate to that are not in the focus of GiveWell and <span>ACE</span> will be charities in prioritization research itself (let\u2019s include 80,000 Hours here for the moment) and in <span>EA</span> movement building. These may be further subdivided, but I\u2019ll use these  two as examples for \u201cprogram areas\u201d for now. (Or \u201cintervention areas,\u201d  but \u201cprogram areas\u201d sounds smoother to\u00a0me.)</p>\n<p>Within these two program areas there are only charities that get <span>EA</span>,  eliminating the need for the third and major advantage of  prioritization research. Hence it will be much less cost-effective to  engage in. That leave the first two\u00a0advantages.</p>\n<p>Further, the donor coordination problem GiveWell faced may, to a  large part, not apply. The problem only occurs when donors have  substantially more faith in their own judgements than in that of the  other donors, either because they\u2019ve put a lot of effort into forming  them or because they have outr\u00e9 moral goals. In my experience, neither  is common, at least among the donors of less than \u20ac10,000 per year that  I\u2019ve talked to, who are probably not the category GiveWell  worries\u00a0about.</p>\n<p>In my experience donors often have the opposite problem. They wish to drive, e.g., <span>EA</span> movement building with their donations but don\u2019t know which  organization to donate to, even after doing substantial research,  because they all seem to do great and value-aligned work. Hence the more  risk-averse donors then fall back on a GiveWell or <span>ACE</span> charity instead while the more risk-neutral ones pick out one at random  or precisely because of its room for more funding, thinking of it as  the best proxy for cost-effectiveness that they can\u00a0find.</p>\n<p>Room for more funding may be a decent proxy in some cases, but  greater scale often correlates with lower cost-effectiveness, so that it  also seems plausible that this metric might lead us astray \u2013 so long as  we think of it as a proxy of an individual  charity\u2019s\u00a0cost-effectiveness.</p>\n<p>But here\u2019s the rub: Unlike in the program area of net distributions, the total room for more funding in <span>EA</span> movement building probably doesn\u2019t go far beyond the money that is  available in the movement (if at all), so instead of thinking of our  donation as one to an individual charity, we should think of it as a  donation to a program\u00a0area.</p>\n<p>What we need for that is\u00a0only:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>a common definition of room for more\u00a0funding,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a set of charities in the program area that are value-aligned, and  thus can be trusted to report their room for more funding\u00a0honestly,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a system for donor coordination, which can be as simple as a Facebook group as <span>MVP</span>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since every donor fills some room for more funding and thus displaces  an equivalent donation, all donations are fungible and have equivalent  counterfactual cost-effectiveness: the average marginal  cost-effectiveness of the total filled room for more funding of the  whole program\u00a0area.</p>\n<p>This happens anyway, and donor coordination can only make it better since on average highly cost-effective <span>EA</span> charities may currently receive more donations than they can invest at the margin, and since a lot of <span>EA</span> donors may currently avoid <span>EA</span> metacharities in favor of individual safe bets. We may not be able to  detect the very best opportunities, but those wouldn\u2019t be worth too much  if they\u2019d be filled by a fraction of the available donor money and the  effectiveness waterline is generally\u00a0high.</p>\n<p>The question is no longer whether a marginal donation to GiveWell or  80,000 Hours is more cost-effective but whether prioritization research  is sufficiently cost-effective to deserve our\u00a0donations.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Scaling_It_Up\">Scaling It\u00a0Up</h1>\n<p>Prioritization research and <span>EA</span> movement  building are some obvious first targets for the donor coordination  project since there is a seizable consensus that these are still equally  or more cost-effective than object-level donations, but what if we fill  both these funding\u00a0gaps?</p>\n<p>GiveWell deprioritizes research in program areas when it finds that there are <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/10/15/charities-wed-like-to-see/\">no promising charities</a> implementing the program. If there are really no charities or no  value-aligned charities, then this can\u2019t be helped, but if there are  many value-aligned charities, each of insufficient scale to warrant  GiveWell\u2019s attention, then an evaluation of the program area and a very  cursory review of the charities (to ensure that they\u2019re value-aligned)  can be enough to provide the foundation for donor coordination in  the\u00a0area.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Room_for_More_Funding\">Room for More\u00a0Funding</h1>\n<p>The meaning of room for more funding is highly unclear to me at the  moment, which would need to change in order to get commensurable  estimates from different\u00a0charities.</p>\n<p>Does it mean the amount of funding an organization can invest before  it would choose to leave further funds on its bank account beyond the  end of the fiscal year? Or before a hypothetical investment of further  funds would incur a significant drop in marginal cost-effectiveness? If  so, how\u00a0significant?</p>\n<p>As an example, I imagine that <span>AMF</span> has to be  fairly liquid, so it probably has a lot of money on bank accounts with  low interest. So in the hypothetical case where it gets more money than  it would\u2019ve normally invested in the year, it has to weigh whether it  wants to leave it there until the next year, when it\u2019ll get better  distributions finalized, or whether it is better to invest it less well  than <span>AMF</span> would typically invest it. Maybe  there are regions where it could easily conduct distributions, e.g.,  because Concern Universal works there, but that it has so far avoided  because the malaria incidence is slightly lower than in others or the <span>IR</span> rate slightly higher. In general, suffering accumulates over time, <span>IR</span> rates increase, incidence decreases, so the second option might sometimes be\u00a0better.</p>\n<p>So if room for more funding just means that the extraneous money will  be left on the account until after the end of the year, then it\u2019s  equivalent to some degree of a drop in marginal cost-effectiveness that <span>AMF</span> was not ready to accept. So what drop is that? A significant drop from <span>AMF</span>\u2019s  accustomed level of cost-effectiveness, or a drop below GiveDirectly  level, or a drop not to GiveDirectly level but significant enough that  given the other factors in the evaluation, it would temporarily lose its  top charity\u00a0status?</p>\n<p>For <span>EA</span> movement building and possibly  prioritization research, the leverage multiplier for long-run estimated  cost-effectiveness beyond object-level donations might serve as such a  baseline below which the room for more funding of a charity is closed.  It might be set higher than one to account for the increased uncertainty  of meta work. \u201cLong-run,\u201d because in the short term, heavy reinvestment  into one\u2019s own program will lead to a quicker increase in\u00a0scale.</p>\n<p>For other program areas, different metrics would have to be\u00a0developed.</p>\n<p>And as an ancillary question, in view of home bias and the heavy  commitment that founders make to their charities, how likely is it that  they might rationalize in favor of their own charity being the most  effective, which would increase the room it has until it reaches some  lower marginal effectiveness threshold and thus make it moral for them  to direct somewhat more funds toward it? By extension, staffers might  assume that this partiality affects all the other charities, so that  their own would end up relatively neglected, which would again be  objectively bad in their\u00a0view.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Clustering\">Clustering</h1>\n<p>I\u2019d be happy for my donations to <span>ACE</span> to be  fungible with donations to the Global Priorities Project, GiveWell, etc. assuming that they have funding gaps, but Descartes would disagree. Hence  what constitutes a program area has to be the result of a clustering of  donor interests, the data for which is probably available to Giving What  We Can and <span>EA</span>\u00a0Hub.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Getting_it_Going\">Getting it\u00a0Going</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/peterhurford\">Peter Hurford</a> has started a <a href=\"https://dotimpact.slack.com/messages/p-donor-coord/\">Slack channel</a> for donor coordination, which you can join if you have a Slack account. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/evangaensbauer\">Evan Gaensbauer</a> considers working on something like it.

{"date": "20th Sep 2015", "title": "A minimal definition of Effective Altruism:", "author": "AlasdairGives", "num_comments": "11 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Luke Muehlhauser <a href=\"http://lukemuehlhauser.com/effective-altruism-definitions/)\">recently joked</a>\u00a0that it seems like everyone has their own definition of effective altruism. And it is true, everyone has a spin or aspects of EA they want to emphasise or care about. For myself, I want EA to be as broad and approachable as possible. That said, a definition should not mislead people, there is steel in EA and it does demand a certain intellectual/lifestyle approach.</p>\n<p>Anyway, it seemed like a valuable exercise, at the very least for clarifying my own values to think a bit and try and capture the core of what I believe is important about effective altruism in a minimal definition:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Give More</strong>. Most of us spend only a tiny amount of our time and income trying to make the world a better place. If we give a little more of both, making the effort to make consciously working towards a better world a significant part of our lives, we have an amazing opportunity to make a real difference.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Give Better</strong>. If we want to make a real difference, we should try to use evidence and reasoning so that we have the best chance of having a big positive impact. If we think hard about the impact of our time and money, and use evidence and careful analysis to update and test our beliefs, we can get better at investing it well. Deciding what to do and where to give to have the biggest impact is not easy. But we think the best answers come from being open to new evidence and part of a community of likeminded individuals asking the same questions.</p>\n<p>. Is there anything that this misses which you think of as essential to effective altruism? It deliberately avoids anything that strays into negative affects - for example shades of utilitarianism, or specific causes/values / concepts. Possibly, the biggest weakness is that it says little about how evidence and reasoning lead you to update your beliefs. But the second section seems too long and wordy already, I would like to cut it down if possible. But I think it is a decent first draft anyway.</p></div></div>"},

These are all very important, but there is a lack of focus on \u2018quick win\u2019 projects that EAs can work towards, or if there is I am not aware of them. I would like to argue two reasons why effective altruists should focus more on analysing, selecting and achieving some short term goals or \u2018quick wins\u2019 with solid impact, and not solely on long term existential risk style projects.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Improving_civilisation_now_so_it_can_achieve_long_term_goals_more_effectively_in_the_future\"><span>Improving civilisation now so it can achieve long term goals more effectively in the future</span></strong></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>One of the main reasons that I focus primarily on reducing poverty is that I believe a world without poverty is one that could work towards reducing catastrophic long term risks far more effectively than the world we have today. Or take climate change; in my experience, climate change is low on the list of priorities for most EAs. My understanding of this reasoning is \u2018although it will be bad, it will not wipe out humanity\u2019. But if the projections of temperature and sea level over the next century are to be believed, we will be running into a lot of pressing problems that will slow down long term research. 40% of the world\u2019s population lives within 100 km of the coast, many of whom will be displaced as the water, salinity and storm surges encroach on their land. Rising temperatures will lead to increased droughts, reducing food yields. The actual estimates of the number of climate refugees vary greatly, which to me indicates a large uncertainty, but there is a risk that there will be many indeed.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Who will donate to a charity focussing on analysing and reducing the risk of super intelligence misuse when there are starving refugees at their nation\u2019s doorstep, or their city is slowly going underwater? I\u2019m not able to determine whether climate change specifically should come to the fore of EA work, but I would like to propose that there are more factors at paly than are normally considered. </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Attracting_a_different_mindset_to_the_movement\"><span>Attracting a different mindset to the movement</span></strong></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>There are a lot of different mindsets when it comes to \u2018doing good\u2019. It is quite likely that the majority of those who currently identify as effective altruists are analytically minded. It is important to have people thinking critically about which causes to focus on and which charities within those causes to donate to, but stating the facts and expecting people to act accordingly won\u2019t always work. There are many people who intrinsically want to \u2018do good\u2019, but aren\u2019t willing to change the cause they focus on. Rather than setting aside these people altogether, we should utilise their expertise and passion in a specific area that, while perhaps not being the most pressing cause, can still do a lot of good. These causes may even be areas where there has not been a lot of meta-analysis to determine the best charities within them. It is ideal to have people donating to the most effective charities in the most effective causes, but failing that I would prefer them to donate to the most effective charity in their selected cause (as long as it is a positive cause!) than select their own charities, as intuition is a poor guide to effectiveness.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Evidence of quick wins being achieved by EAs should also help raise the status and profile of the movement and further attract more people to effective altruism in general.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Examples_of_potential_quick_wins\"><span>Examples of potential quick wins</span></strong></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>One quick win I am examining now is lobbying the Australian government to run a public health campaign to reduce meat and dairy consumption, or to tax meat and dairy, or something similar. This would lead to longer lived and healthier humans, reducing the public health burden, lead to a reduction in animal suffering, and reduce environmental impacts, especially greenhouse gas emissions exacerbating climate change.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>The chances of such a campaign being completely successful may be low, but the rewards would be exceptionally high, and even a failed attempt would be likely to change public perception of the issue. It wouldn\u2019t take many EAs to focus on such a project, and they can garner support from people who are active in specific areas but aren\u2019t necessarily EAs (for example vegans/vegetarians in this case).</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Conclusion\"><span>Conclusion</span></strong></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>I haven\u2019t crunched the numbers on these concepts, they are just some ideas I\u2019ve had and a feeling I got after the EA Global conference that there is too much focus on long term issues. I would greatly appreciate any criticisms of this argument or ideas for more quick wins. Having some EAs focus on achieving some quick win projects has the potential to add credibility and numbers to the cause in addition to any good they achieve through the quick win itself.</span></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "13th Sep 2015", "title": "Should people be allowed to ear-mark their taxes to specific policy areas for a price?", "author": "Stefan_Schubert", "num_comments": "11 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>This is a contribution to the <a href=\"/ea/l1/moral_economics_concepts/\">Moral Economics</a> sequence.</em></p>\n<p>At a given price level,<em> </em>there is a an <a href=\"http://www.digitaleconomist.org/co_4010.html\">optimal bundle of goods and services</a> that maximizes a consumer's preference satisfaction. This means that given that you are consuming such an optimal bundle, you cannot increase your preference satisfaction by buying more of one good or service and less of another - e.g. more gym classes and less video games.</p>\n<p>Suppose, however, that an external actor subsidizes gym classes (e.g., your parents, the government), but not video games. Then you might increase your preference satisfaction by buying more gym classes and less video games. Indeed, that is the point of such subsidies.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the government's optimal bundle of goods and services - which is a function of the voters' preferences - may change if certain goods and services are subsidized. For instance, if someone is willing to top up each extra dollar the government spends on foreign aid with ten extra cents, it might rationally decide to spend more on foreign aid, and less on other policy areas. (Exactly how large this top-up would need to be would depend on the marginal utility that the government gets from more foreign aid spending, and the marginal disutility it gets from less spending on other policy areas.)</p>\n<p>No doubt there are people willing to make such top-ups, which gives room for <a href=\"http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/papers/moral-trade.pdf\">moral trade</a>\u00a0 - a notion developed by Toby Ord - between them and the government. Like all forms of trade, such trade would increase both parties' preference satisfaction.</p>\n<p>In principle, anyone could take part in such a moral traed (e.g. another government). Here I am going to focus on a special kind of moral trade with the government, however, namely <em><strong>ear-marking your tax money for a special policy area</strong></em> (e.g. foreign aid) for a certain price. People could be allowed to ear-mark all or parts of their taxes for a particular policy area of their choice, if they paid for it via a higher tax-rate.</p>\n<p>My guess is that a fair number of voters would accept this offer even on terms which are quite favourable for the government. If so, allowing people to ear-mark their taxes for a price should be very advantageous for the government. The fact that it got more tax money would outweigh the fact that some of the tax money was ear-marked.</p>\n<p>Also, note that these ear-marked taxes will to some extent cancel each other out. If four tax-payers, who pay an equal amount of tax, ear-mark their taxes to four mutually exclusive and equally large policy areas, the government will get more tax money in total without the distribition of government spending having been changed. In practice, some areas are going to be more popular to fund, however, which means that this will perhaps not be the normal state of affairs.</p>\n<p>Another advantage is that people might feel more motivated to pay their taxes if they knew that their taxes were going to something they felt strongly about. That could mean less tax evasion. It could also mean that people started to think of their ear-marked taxes as something more akin to charity, and less like taxes in the classic sense. It would feel like less of a burden.</p>\n<p><span>One possible worry that deserves comment, though, is connected to the notion of </span><span>counterfactual trust</span><span> (which Ord mentions) and</span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/07/replaceability-isnt-as-important-as-you-might-think-or-weve-suggested/\"><span> </span><span>replacability arguments</span></a><span> </span><span>(which, e.g. 80,000 hours have used a lot). Suppose that lots of people start ear-marking part of their taxes for foreign aid. Then the government might be disposed to reduce the part of the general pot of money - coming from non-ear-marked taxes - that goes to foreign aid. In the end, the ear-marking will have led to very little extra spending.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>This constitutes a breach of counterfactual trust - the government doesn't distribute the general pot of money in the way it would have done if there hadn't been any opportunity for moral trade, because it thinks that in this way, it can maximize its moral preference satisfaction. I don't see a moral problem with that (which can be the case with other forms of breaches of counterfactual trust), but there is a potential pragmatic problem. If tax-payers see this happen over and over again, they might be dissuaded from ear-marking taxes for their favourite cause.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>One way to get around this problem is to explicitly refrain from such redistribution of the general pot, at least the first few years. Inevitably, I think that there will be some such redistribution in the end, though.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Potentially, it won't make that much of a difference, though. We know that people have problems getting these replacability arguments. Lots of people don't just want <em>more</em> money to foreign aid - they want </span><span>their </span><span>money to go to foreign aid. If that's right, issues of replacability and worries of breaches of counterfactual trust are less important.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Another worry is that this would introduce a certain element of unpredictability in the government budget - particularly if these sorts of ear-marked taxes became common. Temporary shortfalls in the general budget could be covered by increased government borrowing, but unexpected extra funds would normally have to be saved until new capacity to use them has been added. That would probably be a minor problem, though, as would the extra admin work this would incur.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>One objection is that this would give rich people, who pay large amounts of taxes, an undue influence over government spending. It is indeed true that this system would give them a better chance of satisfying their moral preferences. However, the government's moral preferences would also be better satisfied under this system (since it would only take part in such transactions that increases its moral preference satisfaction). Thus it is not true that the gains that rich people make happen at others' expense. Everyone wins from trade - this is not an exception. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>As some readers might have noticed, there is a similarity between this system and charity tax-deductions. The main difference is that under a system of ear-marked taxes, the controls of where the spending went to would be much more rigorous.Today, you can get tax-deductions for donations to all sorts of highly ineffective charities. Under this system, you could only ear-mark your taxes for something that the government has already deemed spending-worthy.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Has this idea been put forward before? Has it even been tried in practice, perhaps? If not, one could test it by letting people ear-mark small parts of their taxes to a small number of areas - say foreign aid, health care, education, etc. Perhaps it would be most interesting to test it in a country where you can't make charity deductions, since there's bound to be some competition between tax-deductible donations to charity and ear-marked taxes.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I'm not sure whether this would be a good idea, though, and am open to counter-arguments.</span></p></div></div>"},

Re-computing insurance rates for a given policy in a given state is sometimes just an issue of plugging new numbers into an old excel spreadsheet.</li>\n<li>I've read a couple posts on actuarial forms complaining that there is a surplus of trainee actuary candidates. Posters sometimes complain that this is because of e.g. recent news articles which have (correctly) claimed that actuaries have high job satisfaction and high salaries.</li>\n<li>Actuaries typically spend about a fourth of their first 4-8 years of work obtaining a professional certification.

An attempt to make the Moral Market for actors with altruistic inclinations be explicit and numerical, by creating a form of floating currency that permits exchange in space and time between the two markets - notice that inter-temporal backwards trade was not available for altruistic actions before this idea, you could not today cooperate and trade with past altruist action.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Intertemporal </span><a href=\"/ea/jb/solving_donation_coordination_problems/\"><span>Coordination Problems for Donations:</span></a><span> To donate maximally impactfully to a fundraiser with a deadline, it seems </span><span>prima facie</span><span> that one should wait until the last minute to guarantee that someone else donates instead of you, since </span><span>your goal is that resources go to that event</span><span>, not that </span><span>your</span><span> resources go to that event. This way you make sure your moral values are satisfied, and keep the resources to satisfy even more of your values. This is different from buying an apple for yourself, where you anticipate the only way of getting it is if your resources purchase it. In the altruistic case, as long as someone pays for the valuable thing, your value is satisfied. </span></p>\n<p><span>This however poses a tragedy of the commons type incentive, where each individual will be better off (morally) by holding on to their resources for longer than would be desirable from the group's perspective. It becomes more difficult to predict how much will be raised by the fundraising. This concept is related to </span><span>apathy bias </span><span>or the</span><span> bystander effect</span><span> in behavioral economics. This does not happen in classical economic theory because individuals are not indifferent over who gets the cake, the stock, or the wage as long as someone gets it. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Direct Funding for EAs: </span><span>A direct linkage between an individual who wishes to have their values promoted and another who attempts to promote these values in exchange for money. </span></p>\n<p><span>This has been attempted within the Effective Altruist community by creating </span><a href=\"https://gratipay.com/for/effective-altruists/\"><span>Gratipay</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/user?u=423163&amp;ty=h&amp;u=423163\"><span>Patreon</span></a><span> as donation portals for EAs. Although it is much cheaper per worker hour than donating to institutions - back of the envelope calculation during the EA Think Thank says between 2x to 3x cheaper within a country and up to 5x depending on currency exchange - this form of trade doesn\u2019t have a large fraction of EA donation resources yet. Direct funding also permits funding for causes that are unknown or neglected within the EA community. If one single donor would like to sponsor an EA to research how Emulation Economics would disrupt the economy, and a single researcher is interested in doing this, direct donations between the two could guarantee this is done, whereas institutions or certificates would not. Direct Funding will be further discussed in a later post in the series. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Donation Swapping:</span><span> Frequently there are tax or legal reasons for two donors with different interests and values to swap their donation targets. Because the market does not have absolute liquidity and zero viscosity, it is frequently advantageous for individuals to A and B to reach an agreement on how much to donate to causes 1 and 2, and then A who values 1 donates to 2 and B who values 2 donates to 1, because some market inefficiency makes that morally cheaper for them. This is a form of regulatory arbitrage. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Moral Trade: </span><span>...as described by Toby Ord: If two parties have different moral views, then there is another type of trade that is possible: they can exchange goods or services such that both parties feel that the world is a better place, or that their moral obligations are better satisfied. We can call this </span><span>moral trade</span><span>. For instance, a person concerned with animal welfare might offer to donate to Oxfam if their friend, who is concerned with global poverty, agrees to abstain from eating meat for a year. </span></p>\n<p><span>Moral trade is the philosophical underpinning on top of which moral economics can be built. If there was no moral trade, there would be substantially less reason for a science of moral economics. Moral Trade can happen almost irrespective of moral stance, which we can dub the </span><span>Moral Trade Orthogonality Thesis</span><span>. For any ranking of actions according to their moral permissibility or desirability, whether measured in (a)virtue,(b)ranking seen from a veil of ignorance, (c)utilons, (d)hedons, (e)sacredness or (f)accordance with universal reason, there might be ways in which trade could facilitate the attainment of moral good from the perspective of an individual who endorses that ranking scheme. The divergence in moral views between individuals greatly facilitates this trend. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Tragedy of Commonsense Morality:</span><span> In </span><span>Moral Tribes</span><span>, Joshua Greene distinguishes the types of problems that are partially solved by our moral instincts and agreements (Me versus Us) from those which our moral instincts and system 1 morality are not equipped to solve (Us versus Them). He dubs this latter type the Tragedy of Commonsense morality. Throughout the book he makes a mixed empirical and philosophical case for utilizing system 2, manual mode morality when making decisions of the Us versus Them type, and trusting our senses more for Me versus Us type problems. He further advocates the usage of utilitarianism as a currency when solving problems of the Us versus Them type, though for space reasons I will not describe the many reasons for which he considers this desirable. It is worth noting that the book ends with a link to the Givewell website, indicating Greene's alignment with the use of Moral Trade as strategy to generate morally desirable outcomes. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Acausal Trade:</span><span> Acausal trade is trade which doesn\u2019t involve (relevant) causal contact between the trading parties. If I assume there is an altruist in India who would prefer that I don\u2019t eat beef and she assumes there is an altruist in the US who would prefer that she alleviates the suffering of five poor people in her city, we can make a Moral Acausal Trade, creating a world that is best for both of us without ever interacting: I eat less beef and she helps those five people in a way I couldn\u2019t.</span></p>\n</span></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"_Moral_Economics_Branches\"><strong><span> Moral Economics Branches</span></strong></h2>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong> <br> </strong></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Many_other_concepts_are_of_service_to_reason_about_Moral_Economics__To_accelerate_the_development_of_the_field__permit_me_to_go_ahead_and_propose_the_creation_of_subfields_or_branches_of_Moral_Economics_\"><span>Many other concepts are of service to reason about Moral Economics.

Differently from rival goods like apples in economics, where my having an apple precludes you having that apple, frequently in Moral Economics what matters is that someone gets an apple, and both of us accrue value out of that individual receiving it. Let me explore below some concepts that are specifically related to counterfactuals and how they behave differently in Moral Economics:</span></span></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<strong>\n<li>\n<p><span>Labor replaceability:</span><span> See MacAskill and Todds' theses. An amoral doctor may care about acquiring resources (money) and that she saves patients. A moral doctor frequently will instead care changes in use of resources from what would happen otherwise. They would prefer to save more lives than if someone else was a doctor, and may also divert a fraction of their resources (say 50% of their salaries) towards saving more lives indirectly through charity or astronomical waste interventions. </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Ripple effect risk analysis: </span><span>Although companies and States have incentives to do risk analysis of ripple effects in the future, altruists have a much stronger reason due to a few factors: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>1)Most of economics externalities are not externalities from an altruist perspective, since they generate, remove or preempt values from agents that are within the circle of altruistic concern </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>2)There are vastly more individuals who are not you than who are, and vastly many more potential individuals in the future than now (10^30 is a conservative estimate if silicon based moral agents are impossible, 10^50 if possible) </span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>3)Power law distributions are more common in large scale economies than in small trades or partnerships. </span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</strong> \n</ul>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Some_of_the_work_conducted_by_Sandberg__Hillebrand__Ord__Armstrong__Douglas__Bostrom_and_more_recently_the_Open_Philanthropy_Project_fall_within_this_scope__Ripple_effects_are_particularly_important_for_altruists_because_altruists_are_more_impartial_about_how_far_in_the_future_the_consequences_of_their_actions_generate_benefit__Risk_analysis_is_important_because_the_same_is_true_for_negative_consequences___\"><span> Some of the work conducted by </span><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=aefVOM4AAAAJ&amp;cstart=20&amp;citation_for_view=aefVOM4AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC\"><span>Sandberg</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=aefVOM4AAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=aefVOM4AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC\"><span>Hillebrand</span></a><span>, Ord, Armstrong, Douglas, Bostrom and more recently the Open Philanthropy Project fall within this scope. Ripple effects are particularly important for altruists because altruists are more impartial about how far in the future the consequences of their actions generate benefit. Risk analysis is important because the same is true for negative consequences. \u00a0</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<strong>\n<li>\n<p><span>Donation overdetermination</span><span>: Many interesting game theoretic questions arise when donations are overdetermined.

Two distinct forms of boundaries are relevant, the boundary for agents that behave like me in similar contexts, and the boundary for agents that are me. Since this is a complex sub-topic and there is much to be said, I\u2019ll take Leo Arruda\u2019s suggestion and save it for a later post. </span></strong></p><strong>\n<br>\n<h2 id=\"Moral_Economics_as_a_Response_to_Coordination_Problems\"><span>Moral Economics as a Response to Coordination Problems</span></h2>\n<br>\n<p><span>Some readers might be tempted to see moral economics as a solution to coordination problems. In some cases, knowing what a moral agent should do indeed solves or helps coordination problems to be solved. When instead of MaxSelf you are MaxSum, many games that were negative zero sum or zero sum become positive, that is, the structure of incentives which created the game is more favorable to moral players than to selfish players. This isn\u2019t always the case, in very few cases, the invisible hand actually defeats morality and altruism </span><span>even when judged by the total sum of good</span><span>. These cases, however, are infrequent. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>A more frequent and widely studied problem when interactions between more selfish and less selfish agents end up being less beneficial for the altruistic agent, who would be better off in a group that is more altruistic, that punishes cheaters, that is more moral etc\u2026 These cases are frequently studied in evolutionary biology (a nice summary is </span><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=aNFzP50AAAAJ&amp;cstart=60&amp;sortby=pubdate&amp;citation_for_view=aNFzP50AAAAJ:aDl3D7KC1E4C\"><span>Novak 2013</span></a><span>), and it is worth mentioning that the benefit accrued by a selfish agent is not considered benefit to the altruistic ones within biology, but frequently should in Moral Economics when consequentialist altruistic agents are involved. </span></p>\n</strong><p></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>For instance, today I stunned a bike shop owner when telling him I have no intention of making sure my bike seat isn\u2019t stolen, and prefer to purchase new seats sometimes instead of locking that one, because I consider the benefit accrued by the thieve and the counterfactually would be stolen other person to also be accrued by me (at some 0.5&lt;x&lt;1.0 rate), making the case for seat protection too weak to matter.

For practical reasons, direct-intervention volunteering focuses on the local, such as volunteering in a soup kitchen or cleaning up a local trail. And volunteering focused on raising money rarely capitalizes on the market value of the volunteer's free time; think: lawyers raising money through a bake sale. \u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"What_Is_the_Value_of_One_s_Free_Time_\">What Is the Value of One\u2019s Free Time?</strong></p>\n<p>The simplest answer is the market rate for whatever one does for a living, e.g., web development, financial advice, legal advice, personal training, writing, editing, translation, etc. Some people have even more-valuable talents that do not lend themselves to a full-time career. If you have ever attended a charity auction, you likely have seen examples of these types of talents.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Potential_Solutions_\">Potential Solutions </strong></p>\n<p><em>Work longer hours and donate the earnings to effective charities</em>. Most salaried employees do not have the option to work more hours at their job and collect a proportionately larger paycheck.</p>\n<p><em>Sell one\u2019s services on an existing website like Craigslist</em>. Although possible in theory, there is not (as far as I know) a market for regular people to sell a few hours of their time in this manner.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Proposal__Create_a_New_Market_\">Proposal: Create a New Market </strong></p>\n<p>Another solution would be to create an online marketplace in which people could sell their time at its most-valued rate and give all, or a published percentage, of the proceeds to a designated charity. The idea would be to create a market that does not presently exist in which people could efficiently convert free time into money. Participants on both ends of a transaction would be contributing to charity, thereby creating an extra-market reason for consumers to purchase services on this site, even if the same service is available for the same price elsewhere. Think of it as an effective bake sale.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"How_It_Might_Work__Just_Spitballin__here_\">How It Might Work (Just Spitballin\u2019 here)</strong></p>\n<p>The site would allow individuals to offer services and request services. Service providers would register an account and would receive ratings and reviews. The goal would be to create a genuine, competitive market without substantial barriers to entry. Ideal services would be those that could be provided remotely, such as the services mentioned above. But as mentioned above, because the proceeds go to charity, I suspect markets for unusual services would emerge that would not ordinarily exist.</p>\n<p><em>Where would the money go? </em>The site would promote EA-endorsed charities, but ultimately service providers would be able to choose the recipient of their funds. All payments would be through the site and would go directly to the designated charity. The site would publish how much money it moves to designated charities.</p>\n<p><em>Do All Proceeds Go to Charity?</em> Giving all proceeds to charity has a compelling simplicity to it. That said, I am drawn to the idea of creating a market that encourages for-profit, EA-oriented businesses. I could imagine a commercial niche developing for individuals (or even small companies) who give 30% of their revenue to charity. Indeed, the site might even be able to fund some or all of its own costs by taking a percentage of the for-profit revenue.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Potential_Impact\">Potential Impact</strong></p>\n<p><em>First, </em>it would capture some portion of current, sub-optimal volunteering and convert it into much more effective volunteering.</p>\n<p><em>Second, </em>it would generate more volunteering. We all waste time. While saving the world is a better use of time than watching bad television, converting bad-television time into world-saving time is unfortunately not that simple. The goal of this site would be to make it simpler.</p>\n<p><em>Third, </em>it would be a potential source of PR and information for EA thinking and EA causes.</p>\n<p><em>Lastly, </em>it would be a means of widely teaching one of the most important and poorly understood EA concepts: trade-off costs.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Feedback\">Feedback</strong></p>\n<p>So, what am I missing?</p></div></div>"},

Enrollment is open to anyone and everyone, and is free. The course was slated to start in May, but was delayed for a few weeks for whatever reason. This is a reminder for anyone to sign up, or start the coursework, lest they forgot about it in the interim. This course follows the recent release of Dr. Singer's latest book,\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://www.mostgoodyoucando.com/\">The Most Good You Can Do</a>,\u00a0</em>written on the topic of effective altruism.</p>\n<p>If you know anyone who is interested in ethics or effective altruism, whether they be college students or not, this course may be a good way to introduce friends to the philosophy and the movement. If you host local meetups for effective altruism, consider planning them around discussing what comes up in the course.</p>\n<p><br>From the course description:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>Effective altruism is built on the simple but unsettling idea that living a fully ethical life involves doing the most good one can. In this course you will examine this idea's philosophical underpinnings; meet remarkable people who have restructured their lives in accordance with it; and think about how effective altruism can be put into practice in your own life. </span></p>\n</blockquote></div></div>"},

At the deadline, we had twelve submissions.</p>\n<p>This round, we are buying a certificate for\u00a01/70th Ryan Carey and Brayden McLean's founding of and involvement in EA Melbourne during 2013, for $1000.</p>\n<p>The deadline for applications to round 3 is May 25th. Apply\u00a0<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1D1PlHNi_7ya9iI1StsR5vSraDvcjTFk-fk-DIUYFtu4/viewform\">here</a>!</p>\n<p>Below is our evaluation of EA Melbourne. As usual, this is a very rough and quick evaluation. No one involved with EA Melbourne has endorsed this as an account of their impact, and we expect that this evaluation would change significantly if we put in more time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Evaluation_of_Founding_EA_Melbourne\">Evaluation of Founding EA Melbourne</h2>\n<p>We think the EA community in Melbourne has had a significant impact, with many people either making large donations or working on EA projects full time who would not have done so otherwise. We're evaluating this impact at around $100k / year, even considering only donations+replacement costs at EA organizations, which we expect to significantly understate the real impact.</p>\n<p>Many of these effects seem likely to be long-lasting, and we feel comfortable extending the benefits over at least 5 years.</p>\n<p>It is much harder to attribute these impacts to the formal EA Melbourne group, as compared to the informal community, the LW group, TLYCS, the actions of individual EA's in Melbourne, and so on. We had a few conversations to try to get a better sense of this allocation of responsibility. In the end we certainly didn't get a confident answer, but we got a vague intuitive feeling for the situation.</p>\n<p>Based on this impression, we allocated 10% of the responsibility to the formal organization of EA Melbourne. Interpreted narrowly we think this is more likely to be an overestimate than an underestimate.</p>\n<p>But we think that there are other benefits from EA Melbourne that can justify this estimate, and which will tend to be on the same scale as the direct effect. For example, the broader EA community in Melbourne clearly had a positive effect; but EA Melbourne looks like it will have a big impact building and growing a similar community in the future. And to the extent that other organized communities and the online presence of EA played a big role, it seems that EA Melbourne has made similar contributions back to the broader EA community.</p>\n<p>Our estimates concern the impact of EA Melbourne during its first 6 months. We assumed that Brayden and Ryan were almost entirely responsible for the founding of EA Melbourne. People other than Brayden and Ryan were clearly involved with the operation of EA Melbourne over this period. Conversely, EA Melbourne continued to exist after this initial period and it seems likely that its founding will continue to have positive impacts going forward beyond those already mentioned. In the end we called this a wash.</p>\n<p>Overall, we evaluated EA Melbourne at $70k in stimulated EA donations. In this round, we purchased impact at a rate of one dollar per \u00a0dollar of stimulated EA donations, for a total price of $70k. This was about half of the price paid in the previous round.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Some_notes_on_our_evaluations_\">Some notes on our evaluations:</h2>\n<p>We are more concerned with future generations than with current suffering, and have valued \"dollars moved to GiveWell top charities\" several times lower than \"EA donations stimulated.\" We welcome submissions with both kinds of benefits, but wanted to explain why they have not been purchased so far. We do believe that donations to GiveWell's top charities have positive direct and indirect effects on the future, and we also value reductions in current suffering. But these benefits seem substantially smaller than the direct and indirect benefits of more focused interventions, or of organic growth of the EA movement that generates additional donations.</p>\n<p>Some submissions involved impacts that have not yet materialized, for example positive effects on people who haven't yet done anything differently as a result, but who may do something differently in the future. For the most part, we have held off on purchasing these.</p>\n<p>We continue to evaluate influencing people at a discount based on an uncertain allocation of responsibility. But many of our submissions have been for EA outreach, and they have been the cheapest submissions despite this discount.</p></div></div>"},

There are several reasons we discount, such as time preference and uncertainty, and these behave differently in different contexts.</p>\n<p>In this chapter I explore discounting for uncertainty in a health context. I argue that it is important to include a discount rate for uncertainty about future medical progress, but that it should be relatively low. I show how such a discount rate differs in practice from discounting for time preference. I explain how the inclusion of such a discount rate allows better counterfactual estimates of the health effects of a research or eradication programme.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DiscountingHealth.pdf\">You can read the full article here.</a></p></div></div>"},

One could imagine an extreme case where a donor, unsure where best to donate, follows a published 'EA consensus position', which recommends donations via aggregating the judgements of other ('expert'?) EAs.<br><br>I'd guess people in this forum may have thought about this, or on something related. I'd be interested in canvassing opinion on i) whether this is worth exploring further, and ii) discussion of the best way this could be done. Besides the case above, I would guess the infrastructure required to make the information of what other EAs think more fluid could have value in other things (e.g. moral trade).<br><br>So, any ideas?<br><br><br>[This was inspired by conversations by Alison Woodman and Owen Cotton-Barrett.

I have a few ideas of what to do instead, but I'll comment later to avoid priming etc.]<br></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "2nd May 2015", "title": "Expected Utility Auctions", "author": "Denis Drescher", "num_comments": "8 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>In this article I want to give an explanation for a phenomenon in the effective altruism community that might look a bit like the streetlight effect, propose an idea for a software that might help to further optimize this area, and ask you for your input. (<a href=\"http://claviger.net/expected-utility-auctions.html\">Cross-posted from my blog.</a>)</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"Open_Phil_Type_Interventions\">Open Phil\u2013Type Interventions</h2>\n<p>Insightful quantitative analyses give me the warm-fuzzies, but there may well be highly effective interventions, maybe even interventions more cost-effective than GiveWell\u2019s top charities, that are not easily quantifiable. The Open Philanthropy Project has set out to find them, but so far it has not published any hard and fast recommendations.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile outsiders seem to have mistaken our enthusiasm for certain more easily quantifiable interventions for \u201ceffective altruism is about donating to easily quantifiable interventions\u201d rather than \u201ceffective altruism is about doing the most good.\u201d That\u2019s weird. But in a <a href=\"/ea/gl/common_misconceptions_about_effective_altruism/31r\">comment on my article</a> David Moss noted that there is something going on that does look like the streetlight effect. Still I think that this is the result of good judgment. That, however, doesn\u2019t mean that the same good judgment could not also lead to different decisions given more information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Expected_Utility_and_Limited_Diversification\">Expected Utility and Limited Diversification</h2>\n<p>What the streetlight effect describes is a scenario where you lose your wallet in the park, and then go up to the street to search for it there since there are streetlights there and you\u2019d never find it in the dark of the park anyway. The reality is more like that you haven\u2019t lost any particular wallet but that there are potentially a whole bunch of wallets lying around on the street and in the park. Since the light cones are so small, you figure chances are that the biggest wallets are probably somewhere out in the dark. (Unrelated question: When you find a wallet with just $3,340 in it and a bunch of business cards of the owner, should you return it or donate the money effectively?)</p>\n<p>Translating the metaphor into reality, the darkness are areas of great uncertainty. You may, for example, have uncertainty surrounding how important the cause is that an intervention is trying to address, how effective the intervention is at addressing said cause, whether the intervention is still cost-effective at the margin, and whether the charity implementing the intervention is any good at it. If these uncertainties were known probabilities, you\u2019d have to multiply them all, but you can\u2019t do that unfortunately. The result of all these pseudomultiplications is that the expected utility of interventions in the dark becomes pretty small.</p>\n<p>All the while there are a few, pretty few, really cool interventions in the cones of the streetlights, those of the GiveWell and Animal Charity Evaluators top charities. The interventions in the dark haze of uncertainty are many, many more, but you can only expect the tiniest fraction of them to have any considerable cost-effectiveness at the margin and even fewer of them to beat the known top charities.</p>\n<p>Ordered by expected utility, the interventions will form something like a hyperbolic function with very few top interventions and a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Telofy/status/594523359163060224\">long long tail</a> of potentially interesting giving opportunities. This doesn\u2019t include interventions that are fairly certain not to be cost-effective.</p>\n<p>When we choose charities to donate to, we can\u2019t diversify infinitely, and that wouldn\u2019t be a good idea anyway. Some even argue against any diversification, but that seems unnecessarily restrictive. In any case, few effective altruists will donate to more than five charities, and they will mostly focus on the charities with the highest expected utility or some slight variation thereof. Most will agree on the high expected utility of the known top charities, but the opinions on the long tail charities will vary widely. One person may be very familiar with a certain long tail charity and may hence think that they\u2019re able to tell with above-average certainty that it\u2019s a good buy, but someone else could worry that this very familiarity might bias the first person\u2019s judgment and donate to a different one or none at all. The result is that the hyperbolic function becomes even more extreme when the y axis are donations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Expected_Utility_Auctions\">Expected Utility Auctions</h2>\n<p>This seems all perfectly logical to me, and I see no reason to criticize these people\u2019s decisions. What would be very valuable, however, is what Open Phil does, to try to find the few good giving opportunities in the long tail and lift them out of it.</p>\n<p>Open Phil, however, has to prioritize interventions that are very scalable because there are eight billion dollar waiting to be invested. The interventions at least have to maintain a comparable marginal cost-effectiveness for long enough to warrant the time and money invested into finding them.</p>\n<p>Significantly, EA metacharities could profit from prioritization. Such goals as to educate the public about effective giving, to fundraise for effective charities, to collect donation pledges, to conduct prioritization research, and much more might all conceivably be highly cost-effective so long as they haven\u2019t overexerted the limits of their scalability or suffer from any other hidden ailments. Worries about these latter problems are probably what\u2019s holding back many EAs who would otherwise donate to metacharities.</p>\n<p>Is there maybe a system that is less reliable than the proper Open Phil treatment but that might serve as a rough guide for these donors and as a training ground for prioritization research hobbyists? <a href=\"http://impactpurchase.org/\">Impact certificates</a> may develop into such a tool, but here\u2019s another idea.</p>\n<p>I envision an expected utility auction site a bit like Stack Exchange,</p>\n<ol>\n<li> where people can post their own estimates of the cost-effectiveness and scalability of their project and their reasoning and calculations behind it </li>\n<li> where other people can reply to such a bid with their own ones and their own calculations </li>\n<li> where a widget at the side displays the current average of the bids weighted according to their upvotes, the standard deviation, and some other metrics of the thread</li>\n<li>where a list gives a sorted overview of these metrics of all threads.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The unit could be something like 1 util/$ = what GiveDirectly can do for $1. The better estimates would influence the overall total more strongly, and the original poster would be incentivized to start out with a reasonable starting bid to earn upvotes and thus exposure for their project.</p>\n<p>Later a link to the donation register of the EA Hub might be useful so that people who read a review a few months after it was published can estimate how much room for more funding is still left for them.</p>\n<p>Do you think this could work? Do you think it\u2019s worthwhile? What other features would such a site need? Who would like to use such a site? Who can implement the MVP? (I\u2019d do it myself, but I should really be working on my thesis.)</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p></div></div>"},

{"date": "20th Dec 2015", "title": "Conditional donation commitment to GiveWell top-recommended charity", "author": "vipulnaik", "num_comments": "3 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>This post assumes some familiarity with the work of charity evaluator <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GiveWell\">GiveWell</a>, but here's a quick backgrounder for those not familiar: GiveWell lists a small set of top charities to donate to, and publishes detailed reviews of each. The <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/11/18/our-updated-top-charities-for-giving-season-2015/\">list for 2015</a> comprises <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Malaria_Foundation\">Against Malaria Foundation</a> (malaria bednet distribution), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GiveDirectly\">GiveDirectly</a> (unconditional cash transfers), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deworm_the_World_Initiative\">Deworm the World Initiative</a> (deworming), and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis_Control_Initiative\">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a> (deworming). GiveWell's recommendations have acquired the status of a gold standard for conventional, unattached donors, and GiveWell has a particularly strong reputation among many of the people who read this site and identify as effective altruists. GiveWell also works closely with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Ventures\">Good Ventures</a>, the private foundation of Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife Cari Tuna. Good Ventures has made significant donations to GiveWell's top charities, mostly at GiveWell's suggestion, with the amount reaching <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Ventures#Grants_to_GiveWell-recommended_charities\">$44.4 million</a> (plus $1 million to standout charities, plus a separate three-year $25 million grant to GiveDirectly) in 2015. This post uses some estimation I did in a recent post titled <a href=\"/ea/qs/givewell_money_moved_forecasts_and_implications/\">GiveWell money moved forecasts and implications</a>.<br></em></p>\n<p>In this post, I describe a donation commitment I am making. Part of the reason for making this commitment publicly is that I believe the structure of the commitment might be relevant to the donation decisions of others intending to donate to the same recipients. The other reason is that my decision process and the structure of my final commitment may themselves be of interest to others.</p>\n<p>I believe that GiveWell's <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/11/18/our-updated-top-charities-for-giving-season-2015/\">updated top charity list</a> represents one of the best attempts to provide a list of top places to donate to for the conventional, unattached donor. I do have some reservations about the way they have structured their recommendations, and in particular I think that they have missed out on a number of things in their evaluation that are pretty important to me as a donor (this isn't the place to go into them, but you can see my <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/12/10/december-2015-open-thread/comment-page-1/#comment-934519\">comment on GiveWell's December open thread</a> for a summary of my concerns).</p>\n<p>This is probably the first year in my life when I can make a reasonably significant donation to a GiveWell top-recommended charity without it noticeably affecting my finances; previously when I made such donations I could see the effect on my bank accounts for months and even years to come. Despite this, I am not making any upfront donation to a GiveWell top-recommended charity. Part of the reason is that I simply lack the time to investigate these, and I feel that GiveWell's reviews don't address many of the questions that I would like answers to (so I cannot rely on them exclusively). More importantly, however, I expect that even after thoroughly answering the questions I have, I am still quite likely to decide simply to not donate to a GiveWell top charity. Therefore, at this point in my life I don't believe it's rational for me to either spend time investigating things or make a donation based on expectation.</p>\n<p>Despite my reservations, I believe that both GiveWell and its top charities represent important and positive developments in their respective areas, and I would like to see them continue to thrive. Fortunately, I believe that both GiveWell and its top charities are in no danger of death, and will probably raise quite a bit of money, more than what I consider necessary for their core survival and ability to progress. But what if I'm wrong? What if they fail to raise enough money? I would then find their funding gap important to fill, and might actually donate. Pondering this more, I thought that it might make sense to structure a donation commitment that is explicitly tied to the amount of money that GiveWell moves from donors other than Good Ventures to its top charities.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"The_donation_commitment\">The donation commitment</strong></p>\n<p>My strategy is to structure my donation commitment so that it is zero for very small and very large amounts of money raised, and is an upside-down quadratic between a lower cutoff and an upper cutoff. Last year, GiveWell's top charities raised somewhere between $12.7 million and $13.0 million (in current United States dollars) for its top charities from donors excluding Good Ventures. Let's say the corresponding figure they report for this year is $X (again, in current United States dollars). [NOTE: \"current\" here means the literal dollar amount, without making any adjustments for inflation. In practice, this doesn't matter over the short time horizon under consideration. Also, in practice, I'll defer to GiveWell's numbers even if they start doing inflation adjustments]</p>\n<p>If they report this number X before April 1, 2016, and X is between 10 million and 15 million, denote:</p>\n<p>Y = (X - 10,000,000)(15,000,000 - X)/(1,000,000,000)</p>\n<p>Subject to some personal financial conditions (that I don't want to elaborate on here, but that are very unlikely to be binding), if Y &gt; 0, I will donate $Y to GiveWell's current top-rated charity, Against Malaria Foundation, subject to it still being the top-rated charity. I will complete this donation by April 15, 2016. I will call Y my liability. (To be a little more specific, my personal financial conditions will place a cap on the maximum amount of money I can safely donate. In practice, this cap is likely to be much more than the maximum that can ever arise from this formula. However, if I have unforeseen financial problems, then it could be less. If the cap turns out to be smaller than $Y, I'll pay the minimum of the two).</p>\n<p><strong id=\"My_liability_range\">My liability range</strong></p>\n<p>My liability is maximized if GiveWell raises exactly in the middle of the 10-15 million range, i.e., at 12.5 million. At this level, my liability computes to $6,250. On the other hand, close to the endpoints of 10 million and 15 million dollars, my liability is closer to zero.</p>\n<p>The low liability for small amounts of money moved signifies that at that level, GiveWell seems to have messed up something, and such messing up should not be rewarded too much. At that level, the more the money moved, the more money I will grant. However, beyond $12.5 million (which is roughly the amount raised last year) I start viewing additional growth in money moved as more optional, so I grant less if the money moved increases.</p>\n<p>The upper limit of $6,250 is not a trivial amount for me, but it is not an amount that will destroy my finances (note that the personal financial conditions that I haven't elaborated on basically guarantee that in the event that my finances have taken a turn in a way that this amount will significantly hurt me, I'll probably be paying less anyway).</p>\n<p>My probability estimate for a liability of zero is 88%. In other words, I believe there is only a 12% chance I'll need to pay out any money at all. Most of the remaining distribution falls in the $15 million+ range. I described my estimates for GiveWell money moved in a <a href=\"/ea/qs/givewell_money_moved_forecasts_and_implications/\">previous post</a>. The overall expected value of my outlay, based on my current estimates, is about $300.</p>\n<p><strong>Incentive effects on other donors</strong><br><br>Most potential donors to GiveWell-recommended charities would be unaware of this blog post! For those who are aware, however, this information does not significantly affect the marginal value of their money.<br><br>The margin by which a given donation affects my donation varies from -0.5% to 0.5%, with the +0.5% occurring at a donation level of $10 million, and the -0.5% occurring at a donation level of $15 million. The average of these different marginal effects is exactly zero, which follows mathematically from the fact that at both extremes my outlay is the same (i.e., zero). Moreover, the actual amount that GiveWell will report is uncertain and isn't known by the donor at the time of the donation. So the donor is really relying on a probability distribution over possible amounts of money raised, and must average over the probability distribution. Whatever the distribution, the average cannot be more than 0.5% of the donor's donation in magnitude, and most likely will be a lot less. [Note: I got the 0.5% by doing some calculus; I leave verification as an exercise for the interested reader.] In fact, if the donor estimates only a 12% chance of the money moved even falling in the relevant range, then for every $100 donated, the effect on my donation is at most 6 cents.<br><br>The informational effects are more significant, and I turn to those next.<br><strong><br>What I'm signaling</strong></p>\n<p>By structuring this as a donation <em>commitment</em> (rather than making the donation decision after the fact), I hope to achieve a few goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I'm indicating explicit confidence in GiveWell's work and its top charities, and my support of the work, by showcasing my willingness to donate a relatively nontrivial amount of money to them.</li>\n<li>I am providing clear information about the level of growth that I believe is important for GiveWell and its recipient organizations, below which I would be concerned enough to pitch in.</li>\n<li>By being clear upfront about the conditions, I can plan more clearly for the future fund outlay. It also leaves me with less wiggle room to change the conditions later.</li>\n<li>I am spreading the meme that the amount we donate to charities should be based on how much they'd otherwise raise, and that it's possible to do so in a way that does not create perverse incentives for other donors.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong id=\"Parting_thoughts\">Parting thoughts</strong></p>\n<p>I am not suggesting that most donors to GiveWell-recommended charities structure their donations this way. If my goal was to add to the funds of a GiveWell-recommended charity, then donating to it would be the best way forward (as I explained at the beginning of the post, I haven't investigated GiveWell-recommended charities thoroughly enough, didn't find GiveWell's reviews complete enough, and believe that even if I reviewed them I still may not find them compelling). However, if the goal is explicitly to act as an insurance for the organization, making sure that they have enough money to survive and achieve a basic level of growth, then a donation commitment of this sort makes sense.</p>\n<p>Also, although the above is an isolated donation commitment, I could imagine making a wide range of donation commitments where the amounts of money committed together add up to a substantial amount. As long as the conditions aren't very strongly correlated, it's highly unlikely that many of them would apply in the same year (this is, sort of, the idea behind insurance).</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: In a <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/12/10/december-2015-open-thread/comment-page-1/#comment-934738\">GiveWell blog post comment on December 23</a>, Elie Hassenfeld wrote that GiveWell had, as of December 22, 2015, tracked $15.7 million in donations. Assuming no problems with this estimate, it already puts my obligation for the conditional donation at zero.</p></div></div>"},

{"date": "16th Dec 2015", "title": "Promoting Effective Giving Using List-Style Articles", "author": "Gleb_T", "num_comments": "26 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Wanted to get community feedback and optimization suggestions on promoting effective giving using list-style articles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The purpose for list-style articles would be similar to other types of <a href=\"/ea/qv/effective_giving_vs_effective_altruism/\">effective giving</a> content, namely to lead people to shift their giving toward more effective charities from less effective ones. To be clear, it is not to get people to join the Effective Altruism movement, to avoid the danger of rapid movement growth (see this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCOOtc-sofM&amp;feature=youtu.be\">video</a> and <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/MovementGrowth.pdf\">paper</a>). It is also not to get people to go down the Earning To Give path, as most likely only a small portion of people should go <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/07/80000-hours-thinks-that-only-a-small-proportion-of-people-should-earn-to-give-long-term/\">down that road</a>, and moreover the EA movement as such faces a higher <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-you-should-focus-more-on-talent-gaps-not-funding-gaps/\">talent gap</a> than funding gap. Instead, the goal is to redirect some of the <a href=\"http://www.nptrust.org/philanthropic-resources/charitable-giving-statistics/\">hundreds of billions</a> spent per year on charitable giving toward effective causes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, getting to why use list-style articles as such. On the one hand, most list-style articles pattern-match with shallow content, not something that EAs typically appreciate. On the other hand, list-style articles are one of the <a href=\"http://www.buzzstream.com/blog/content-types-that-earn-most-shares.html\">most widely read and shared</a> types of content on the web, and there are <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32105/The-Top-10-Qualities-of-High-Quality-List-Posts.aspx\">specific strategies</a> for doing high-quality list-style articles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One concern is that these articles might be a turn-off for people who are oriented toward more high-brow content, and would not be inclined to learn about effective giving and especially effective altruism due to it being presented in a list-style article form. To address this concern, I think we should aim to avoid using the term \"Effective Giving\" and certainly \"Effective Altruism\" in the title of a list-style article. Thus, anyone just glancing at the headline would not be turned off by seeing this term in association with a list-style article. Only the people who click on the article and read it would learn about this term and the organizations associated with it. Since the readers of a list-style article are the ones who would enjoy list-style articles and not be put off by them, they would be highly unlikely to be negatively impacted by this type of article and the message of effective giving as conveyed by it, and instead would be impacted positively, on a weak to strong range.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To practice an experimental and data-gathering approach, I decided to try to publish a list-style article, and got this one, \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gleb-tsipursky/8-secrets-of-savvy-donors_b_8792242.html\">8 Secrets of Savvy Donors</a>,\" placed in The Huffington Post. It does not reference effective giving in the title, but talks about it in the body of the text. It is written in an engaging manner, has a clear narrative, conveys emotions, has a variety of images, and conveys a mixture of helpful ideas with promotion of EA organizations, such as Giving What We Can, GiveWell, and The Life You Can Save. It briefly mentions effective altruism as a movement, but does not specifically tie positive emotions with it, and suggests readers contact effective altruists for strategies on donating effectively. I suspect this is the first EA-written and EA-themed list-style article, but please correct me if I'm wrong - I know EAs made other broad-type content, such as memes, but not list-style articles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Posted less than 48 hours ago, this article is spreading organically on social media with minimum publicity. I have not yet shared it with any EA groups, but it has already been shared more than 160 times on StumbleUpon, for example, as of the time of this writing (most articles published at the same time as this one on The Huffington Post Impact section, where this article was published, have less than 20 social shares). Social media shares provide significant evidence of reader enthusiasm for this article, since people are willing to put their personal social capital into sharing the article for their Facebook friends, Twitter followers, StumbleUpon followers etc. to read. Of course, social media sharing also has the additional benefit of many more people getting exposed to the content - a general rule of thumb is that for every social media share, 100 people read the article thoroughly, and many more skim it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another benefit of list-style articles is that they are well suited for fellow EAs to share on their social media. This is because EAs who are social media savvy know that this type of article will be more likely to be read by non-EAs in their social circle, and shared by other EAs. Thus, EAs can help spur social sharing of this type of article strategically, knowing the positive consequences of doing so.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A more broad medium-term goal would be to provide a depository of such articles that EAs can draw from and adapt to their local context. All of you should feel free to do so as well. Another medium-term goal is to have some EAs who specialize in marketing effective giving ideas for a broad audience. This should help address <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-you-should-focus-more-on-talent-gaps-not-funding-gaps/\">one area of talent gap</a> in the current EA movement. For more on promoting effective giving from a systematic perspective, <a href=\"/ea/qv/effective_giving_vs_effective_altruism/\">see this post</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, I'd appreciate your thoughts on this article. Does it work to convey the benefits of effective giving in an easy-to-read and engaging manner? Knowing about the benefits of sharing this type of article, would you share this article on your social media?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Also, would appreciate your thoughts on the meta issues, the strategy of using list-style articles as a way of spreading EA-style ideas about effective giving.

{"date": "3rd Feb 2015", "title": "Should your choice of charity change based on how much money you have?", "author": "Gentzel", "num_comments": "15 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span><span> </span></span></p>\n<p><span>Earlier this year, Bernadette Young and Peter Hurford recommended that I make a post like this once I had enough karma:</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>At an event hosted by the </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/dc.effective.altruism/\"><span>DC Effective Altruism</span></a><span> meet-up group, we discussed if any organizations with large amounts of money, such as USAID, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, or the World Bank, are actually more effective in choosing causes to benefit than GiveWell.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Many are skeptical of this, because it is easy to point to examples of failed projects, naivety, and bad funding priorities. </span><span>However, these organizations seem to be pursuing some very promising projects, and there may be levels of effectiveness that are only feasible with such scale.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>One argument was made that when you are a large organization, you have the ability to start a new initiative entirely and also guarantee that there is enough overall funding, which small individual donations can't. New organizations have a chance to be far more effective and aren't replaceable in many cases, so it might be the case that it is good for the rich to fund these instead of GiveWell charities.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Another argument was that if these wealthy groups did fill all the room for funding of GiveWell's top charities (they easily could), the top charities would naturally become less effective and not do as well at attracting other funding (I don't think it matters who funds a charity except if it changes the net amount donated to effective causes). The part of this argument that seems to actually matter is whether or not effectiveness will be reduced to the point that other causes would become better to fund, before full funding is reached.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>An idea in common between these arguments seems to be that marginal contributions and large sum contributions will differ in cost effectiveness depending on the circumstances of a cause or charity. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>If a cause requires $1,000 for its intervention, and you donate $1, you don\u2019t have any effect unless $999 was or will be donated by others so your dollar bridges the gap to the next intervention. If others donate as much or more than is needed, your donation is replaceable. This is part of the problem of effectively coordinating small donors.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>If the same cause already has $999 and you donate $1,000 the intervention will happen, but $999 might not be able to be spent on an effective cause. This is the inefficiency of donating too much, and possibly giving an organization room to be less cost effective with its interventions. The room for funding has been surpassed.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>When there is high variance in the amount that may be donated, it pays to have a charity where each small contribution can make a difference. With each contribution making a difference, it becomes possible for many different levels of funding to be cost effective. The charities that GiveWell recommends seem to fit this pattern: they have very inexpensive interventions that are scaleable. Returns on investment are close to linear, even if there are diminishing returns.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>On the other hand, with things like research, there may be larger brackets for what amount of money can make a difference. Once higher levels of funding are reached there is likely to be better cost effectiveness. If the next most meaningful way for a group to do better is to hire a new employee, they may need a lot of money. Meeting and not exceeding the need of such organizations requires coordination that small donors are unlikely to achieve. This may be where the rich have a comparative advantage. Returns on investment may be more like a step function, at each new threshold there is a sudden jump in effectiveness.</span></p>\n<p><span>I don't have a strong opinion on these arguments, but I do think this is a good place to discuss them. Should what large aid groups focus on influence what </span><span>we </span><span>focus on? Should we work toward changing these organizations to be more effective if they aren't already? Should the amount of money you earn actually change where you donate?</span></p>\n<p><span> ______________________________________________________________________________________________ </span></p>\n<p><span>(I will post some examples of what the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has looked into in the comments below, as well as an earlier comment from Peter Hurford responding to an earlier version of this post. </span><span>If there is any mathematical naivety in the arguments presented above, please point it out. </span><span>Some of the reasoning about marginal versus large sum donations falls into a similar category as the </span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox\"><span>Sorites paradox</span></a><span>, and I imagine it might be the sort of confusion you can defeat with math.</span><span> For example, taking limits in math is a way to deal with </span><span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes\">Zeno\u2019s paradoxes</a>)</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},

{"date": "29th Jan 2015", "title": "Many winding roads: an EA origin story", "author": "tomstocker", "num_comments": "5 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span>Thank you Peter for suggesting this. This is my first post, and I've not blogged successfully. Feedback in the forms of evaluation/appreciation/coaching are all very welcome, either to <a href=\"mailto:tomjwstocker@gmail.com\">tomjwstocker@gmail.com</a> or on the comments section (e.g. am I doing too much / is it too long etc).</span></p>\n<p>I have wanted to hear people's 'testimonies' for a long time (what I've heard this kind of thing called in evangelical religious movements - activist and political movements I've been around have called it something like 'getting involved'). I think these are important as you're able to see why people are here, and you're able to see how other people you're talking might be better encouraged to join in.</p>\n<p>It is however, a bit strange to give a testimony to an audience of x&gt;1, as \"EA\" feels like such an all encompassing thing to come to and usually I'd be selective depending on who's in front of me. I've tried to do this post by communicating all the possible stories that could have contributed to my journey from a little altruistic and ineffective, to quite altruistic and a little effective. My hope in writing this is that readers get insight into how to help people move themselves further along the altruism scale. I see the desire to be effective as a function of genuine altruism - as opposed to thinking of yourself as altruistically motivated - and knowledge, and the knowledge is already here in abundance, so that's the focus.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Section_1__The_threads\"><span>Section 1: The threads</span></h1>\n<p>These are the stories I tell myself about why I care / how I learnt about how to approach altruism etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Depression\">Depression</h2>\n<p>Depression in teenage years, surrounded by posh and rich while being posh and poor, while having a few very good friends that were extremely disadvantaged seemed to create an anti-authoritarian or anti-cultural sentiment against the rich. This lead to questioning of power structures, cultural norms, who appropriated wealth, whether things could change and what I could do about it. This questioning lead me to leftists, democracy and human rights activists, the environmental movement around climate camp, economics, and eventually, GWWC. As soon as I befriended other people that seemed to care, I became happy. It was a non-trivial depression that I think came from false-guilt and a deep sense of isolation. It could also just have been random biology.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Medicine\">Medicine</h2>\n<h2 id=\"_Not_knowing_really_what_to_do_with_my_life_in_school__as_I_was_an_intellectual_jack_of_all_trades__I_sought_advice__People_said_I_would_make_a_great_doctor__and_I_couldn_t_think_of_anything_better__Through_the_application_process_I_was_socialised_to_convince_myself_that_I_wanted_to_help_society__although_I_did_before_hand__this_process_brought_out_this_desire_into_a_place_of_greater_prominence___\">\n</h2><p>Not knowing really what to do with my life in school, as I was an intellectual jack of all trades, I sought advice. People said I would make a great doctor, and I couldn't think of anything better. Through the application process I was socialised to convince myself that I wanted to help society (although I did before hand, this process brought out this desire into a place of greater prominence).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"Complex_Regional_Pain_Syndrome\">Complex Regional Pain Syndrome</h2>\n<p>Severe pain in early 20s: after fairly routine knee surgeries for what was thought to be juvenile arthritis, I developed Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, and deteriorated over 6 months without a diagnosis to the point where I was in big, incessant pain and relied on a wheelchair. This made me reflect on:</p>\n<p>a). how society, people I thought were friends etc. just couldn't handle the thought of someone young being in a wheelchair, and couldn't be bothered to empathise or think through their failure to acknowledge the importance pain has on a life. This revealed very starkly a collective blind spot to suffering. I've thought about this. It appears like cowardice, but I think its a moral cheating mechanism - hear no evil/see no evil then I don't have to act, so my subconscious which is to some extent directed by conscious choices and feelings relating to how much you think others matter, is going to block out the evil where possible. I thought from this that people would also have similar responses to others in pain or other societal problems.</p>\n<p>b). if I'm suffering to this extent, and there are 6.x bn people on the planet, there must be a very large category of people suffering to a much worse extent. This generated deep wells of compassion and motivation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"_Spiritual_journey_\">\"Spiritual journey\"</h2>\n<p>I formed atheist/agnostic views at a young age through poor role models and logic. However, while in big pain, became interested in meditation. I meditated regularly for 18 months and developed a strange and wonderful set of subjective experiences. These included intense feelings about the value and sanctity of life, and periods of feeling overwhelmed by compassion and overwhelmed by the suffering of the world, and by the large scale neglect of the global poor. This helped with motivation. The meditation also facilitated a calm, inquiring approach, and reduced my horrendous ego. Unfortunately, I got freaked out by some other experiences, and gave up practicing, and the horrendous ego is back with vengeance - I'm only now starting to develop a practice again after 4-5 years because the ego has become a limiting factor in my attempts to improve the condition of humanity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Meeting_fantastic_people\">Meeting fantastic people</h2>\n<p>With a fair amount of free time studying medicine at a low-intensity university (Manchester), I went out to try and learn about the problems in the world. One way of doing this was documentary night. The person running it was a book-seller activist involved in many causes in effective ways that moved groups along without putting him in the limelight. This person gave me an activist mentoring and he ended up as my best man. There were other fantastic people that coached and pointed me in the right direction along the way, but Adie and my wife Abbie stand out among them.</p>\n<p>After becoming an 'EA', discovering the EA community was just fantastic, and the living examples of Toby etc. boosted the altruism component of my life no end through social proofing / inspiration (even though I haven't interacted with other EAs that much yet).</p>\n<h2 id=\"Trial_and_error\">Trial and error</h2>\n<p>Since 2006 I've thrown my all into a very wide range of projects. I started off doing things like working with an autistic child, mentoring asylum seeker children in maths and English, and going to talks to challenge powerful people. Then community work, then non-violent direct action, then gallivanting around the world volunteering for interesting organisations like:\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://clp-bangladesh.org/\">Multi-faceted poverty alleviation for the extreme poor</a> (Bangladesh)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.icahd.org/uk\">Challenging house demolitions as a means to advocate for peace</a> (Israel)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.holylandtrust.org/\">Advocacy for an end to the occupation and reconciliation of fractured palestinian communities</a> (Palestine - this one involved an arrest and beating in response to a reasonable question)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wozazimbabwe.org/\">Encouraging women to stand up in the face of violence for a better government</a> (Zimbabwe)</p>\n<p>Then trying out different things in professional life: public health analyst in Ghana, Comms guy at WaterAid, NHS manager, healthcare productivity consultant, and now upstart at a medical regulator.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Economics\">Economics</h2>\n<p>I did a back of the envelope calculation of being a doctor in terms of years of healthy life. I was disappointed. I thought it would be worth the gamble of doing PPE at Oxford, with the view of changing the hearts and minds of the elite and learning about how to do management/policy/politics as a gamble that there would be a much better way of spending my life on others. Economics helped me think about effectiveness, and slowly won me round to accepting the market as a pretty powerful and necessary thing, which stopped me thinking about poverty in terms of community or state eradication of markets, and opened up a whole new way of thinking about effectiveness (it was there before, but only partial rather than a central thing).</p>\n<h2 id=\"Empowerment_through_small_victories\">Empowerment through small victories</h2>\n<p>One notable example was a fantastic opportunity to save lives after a cyclone in Bangladesh destroyed the water and waste systems and cholera had just started to pick up pace, which I took with both hands. This was very empowering as I organised the whole thing myself - procurement, partnership, negotiation, leveraging local government finances, raising finances from friends etc. and it was made very easy for me because there were great local people that responded quickly to my requests for help in defining the problems and delivering the solutions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Other_potential_but_less_prominent_sources_of_inspiration_to_make_effective_action_for_others_a_priority\"><strong>Other potential but less\u00a0prominent\u00a0sources of inspiration to make effective action for others a priority</strong></h2>\n<p>Books like<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Life-You-Can-Save/dp/0330454587\"> Peter Singer</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bad-Pharma-companies-mislead-patients/dp/0007350740\">Ben Goldacre</a>'s etc. etc.</p>\n<p>Historical movements like Anarchism, Communism, Civil Women's and Human rights, Utilitarianism, Christianity, anti-colonial struggles, (international) public health.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Big name examples like Tutu, Ghandi, Gates, Mandela, John Templeton, Buddha, Dalai Lama, Amilcar Cabral...</p>\n<p>Cultural things like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CI3lhyNKfo\">WW2 liberation songs</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Section_2__Current_things_I_m_working_on__probably_too_much_in_here_\">Section 2: Current things I'm working on (probably too much in here)</h1>\n<p>Here are my current projects.

{"date": "13th Oct 2015", "title": "Possible Reasons to Donate to Innefective Causes", "author": "SydMartin", "num_comments": "16 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>I was recently realizing that in the last year I have spent a non-insignificant amount on charities and causes that I would normally not consider giving to, and quite a few of them are things that I wouldn't consider the most effective or most beneficial charities. For someone that spends a good portion of my life and energy promoting the most effective causes, and encourages everyone to think hard about what they spend their philanthropic money on, it seems counter-intuitive that I would throw money at a lot of non-optimized charities &amp; causes.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>I would wager there are lots of people out there who think deeply about philanthropy and giving that do wind up donating to causes they wouldn't necessarily recommend to others. There are a number of reasons I've chosen to do this and I thought I would share a few with you and see if anyone else has reasons for supporting causes outside of traditional EA charities.</p>\n<h3>\u00a0</h3>\n<h3 id=\"1__It_is_my_friend_s_pet_cause\">1. It is my friend's pet cause</h3>\n<p>Most of you are thinking that is a terrible justification for donating to a cause, but let me explain. First, I don't donate to causes I think are not doing good or potentially doing harm. Usually I trust my friend's judgment on this, but a quick reputation check helps.</p>\n<p>Whenever a friend puts up a \"Donate to this\" request on Facebook I usually try to throw at least $10 at it. Ten bucks seems like a paltry amount - and it is - but anyone that has run a fundraising campaign knows most of the time you are stalking the page watching little donations tick in, spending time trying to figure out who that anonymous donation was from, and wondering why Aunt Agnes hasn't ponied up yet. There is a Pavlovian response we have to watching donations roll in. It is warm and fuzzy! $10 seems like a good deal to give my friend have such a great warm fuzzy feeling.</p>\n<p>It is also substantially easier to ask friends and family to donate to your fundraiser when they know you donated to theirs. So while my money may not be doing the most good, it is an investment in generating a lot of good in the future. I'm spending a small amount and will likely get a large return <a href=\"http://www.sydsbirthdaychallenge.com/fire-2015/\">when I ask</a> for a donation to a much more effective cause.</p>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3 id=\"2__It_makes_me_more_likely_to_continue_to_donate\">2. It makes me more likely to continue to donate</h3>\n<p>I definitely fall into the <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/02/26/0956797612457376.abstract\">moral consistency</a> camp when it comes to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-licensing\">moral-licensing</a>. I do something I think of as good and my brain gets a kick of dopamine (or maybe the dopamine comes into play <a href=\"http://acesounderglass.com/2015/05/25/dopamine-the-tension-builder/\">as I enter my credit card</a> information). Point is I get a big surge from my reward system. I am doing good things! I am being morally consistent with my stated values! I am helping! Good girl *pat*</p>\n<p>Plus, it turns out I never lament spending that money. I will frequently look at my <a href=\"http://www.sydsbirthdaychallenge.com/blog/2015/6/15/being-lower-income-in-effective-altruism\">bank account</a> and think about that latte this morning that I didn't really need. I've never had the experience of looking at my statement and thinking \"If <em>only</em> I hadn't given that $20 to the 'Save the Cute Animals and Cure the Terrible Sickness Foundation' \"</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3 id=\"3__Add_my_name_to_the_list_please_\">3. Add my name to the list please!</h3>\n<p>There are loads of groups out there that, on top of doing their mission work, also work on public policy, advocacy and lobbying. <a href=\"http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/annual_report_final_proof_12.16.14_/0\">Planned Parenthood</a> is a great example of this. While 65% of their budget went to medical services, 16% went to non-medical services, many of which centered around petitioning and advocacy.</p>\n<p>Part of what makes any advocacy work successful is the ability to cite their number of supporters. If you can say you have <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/who-we-are/planned-parenthood-at-a-glance\">8 million</a> supporters, chances are better you can get a representative to listen. Large numbers add clout and legitimacy to your campaigns.</p>\n<p>So even if I just give $10 or $2 my name, little as it is, gets thrown in that pile of names. A lot of advocacy can boil down to comparing who has a bigger pile. Policy is a big sticky mess that is hard to measure and harder to influence, but a small amount of money to add my name to a list of people who say \"yes I agree with this thing, please count me in\" seems like a good, low cost place to start.</p>\n<h3>\u00a0</h3>\n<h3 id=\"4__It_is_a_service_I_use_appreciate_or_think_I_should_be_paying_for_anyway\">4. It is a service I use/appreciate or think I should be paying for anyway</h3>\n<p>I am lucky enough to live in the amazing city of Seattle. Seattle has some of the best radio around. You remember radio right? Such good radio even the <a href=\"http://kuow.org/post/obama-press-corps-gives-love-seattle-radio\">White House press office</a> takes note. So when <a href=\"https://twitter.com/loserboy\">John</a> in the Morning comes on the air and asks me to pony up some spare change, I do.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>This public radio station is a service I use almost daily. It adds dramatically to my life satisfaction and my feeling of being connected to the world, and particularly to my city. <em>I don't consider this philanthropy, these donations come out of my entertainment budget</em>. I am <a href=\"http://www.sydsbirthdaychallenge.com/blog/2015/6/19/book-review-how-to-be-great-at-doing-good-part-i-why-it-matters\">giving for me</a>, for selfish reasons, driven by my passions and needs. So I don't consider this part of my philanthropic giving, but the US tax code does, so I'm listing it here.</p>\n<h3>\u00a0</h3>\n<h3 id=\"5__Signal_boost_a_campaign_or_cause\">5. Signal boost a campaign or cause</h3>\n<p>I'm not the only one that runs event fundraisers. Loads of people do! Most of the time my friends choose highly effective charities, so usually it is something I'm totally on board with, but I also run across a lot of interesting random fundraisers. Sometimes it is just a great concept for a fundraiser, and I want to encourage people to think creatively about fundraising and philanthropy. Sometimes it is for a unique organization that I support in theory, but don't have any evidence for yet.</p>\n<p>Really this bullet can be summed up like this: Hey person, I dig your thinking and I support you. +1</p>\n<h3>\u00a0</h3>\n<h3 id=\"6__A_handful_of_other_EA_rationalist_related_items\">6.

I think it's an unfortunate historical quirk that people concerned with the suffering of non-human animals came to identify so strongly with \"eating plants\", because it's really about not doing harm with your food choices, and the plants are just incidental. Of course not everyone who identifies as Vegan does it for ethical reasons, and it's here that things start getting muddled.</p>\n<p>There's already a slate of qualifiers on the Vegan label to help parse it's meaning in different contexts; health Vegan, raw Vegan, straight-edge Vegan, ethical Vegan (this is me), bivalve Vegan (also me), and a bunch more. My argument here is that we should drop all these qualifiers (maybe retain the simple \"ethical Vegan\"), and simply push the word away from \"eating only plants\" to mean \"not causing suffering with food choices\".</p>\n<p>This isn't just an obsession with semantics on my part. Most of the animal activist community is heavily identified with the Vegan label, and this will be a problem moving forward if Vegan remains synonymous with \"plant based diet\". How will Vegan Outreach explain in a pamphlet on being Vegan that it's OK (and encouraged!) to eat lab grown meats and dairy? Rather than add a new layer of qualifiers to the term, I think that it's time to purposefully evolve it so that it remains relevant and useful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>My pitch is to drop all qualifiers (except maybe \"ethical\" if you're really pushed), and just use Vegan to describe a cruelty-free diet, whatever that diet looks like in the future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>--------</p>\n<p>Update:</p>\n<p>Above I say things like \"push the word away from 'eating only plants' to mean 'not causing suffering with food choices'\". I'm definitely not arguing that Vegan (which is really a lifestyle) refer only to diet. Right now the word has so many different meanings (and qualifiers) that it's difficult to talk with precision about it. My general argument is to move it from \"plant based diet\" --&gt; \"ethical diet\", \"avoiding animal products\" --&gt; \"being concerned about the ethical impact of your lifestyle\", etc.</p>\n<p>Most animal orgs already use Vegan in this way most of the time, although lab grown meats and dairy are really going to force the issue in a way that hasn't happened before. I think there's an opportunity here for (ethical) Vegans to head off this development and actively take ownership of the term, drop all the qualifiers, and clarify the messaging around what being Vegan is really about. It's not about eating plants or not wearing leather shoes, it's about adopting an ethically consistent lifestyle, so if you want to eat a lab grown burger go for it! \u00a0</p></div></div>"},

Who knew!?!</p>\n<p>Let me explain. Aside from the United States and Botswana, every reasonable country (i.e. every country that is not a dictatorship, has more than five citizens, or isn't an otherwise failed state) has signed the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Article 2(1) of the ICESCR commits states to \"take steps, individually and through <strong>international assistance and cooperation</strong>, especially economic and technical\" to help fulfill the economic rights of poor people around the world. Now the ICESCR is a <strong>binding international agreement, </strong>but\u00a0unsurprisingly, there's a lot of disagreement about what it specifically requires and what states are actually obliged to do. That being said, a very very authoritative international legal scholar holds that \"there is broad agreement that the Covenant imposes at least some <strong>extraterritorial obligations.</strong>...\"\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The most authoritative legal interpretations of these extraterritorial obligations hold that developed countries are required to give 0.7% of their GNP in \"official development assistance.\"</strong> Where did they get that magic number? Starting in 1970, a half-dozen UN Resolutions have been passed that set and continually reaffirm this number as the minimum level that states need to reach. Most recently, in 2008, the UN enshrined this target again and the <strong>EU committed to bring itself in line with the standard by 2015</strong>. In 2013, the UK increase it's assistance to the 0.7% minimum to comply with its international obligations.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why does this matter? At the very least, it might be something good to keep in mind in our advocacy. We can shame our countries for failing to comply with the most authoritative statements of international law, and their explicit promises to reach the 0.7% target. But maybe we can do more. \u00a0Maybe someone can bring a case and force them to reach their commitment to 0.7%. I'm not sure what that would look like, or if it is possible to even bring such a case, but it definitely seems worth looking into, maybe even for the PR value alone. That's because a quick glance tells me that <strong>the EU would have to essentially double its aid spending</strong>. Germany and France, for example, are only around the .40% mark (at least as of 2013).\u00a0</p>\n<p>There may be other interesting opportunities lurking in here. The extraterritorial obligations also prohibit countries from trade policies that hurt the foreign poor (subsidies, immigration etc.). I'm going to keep digging around here.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Edit- I have retracted the following text because it is just wrong and misleading:</p>\n<p>\"The European Court of Human Rights and several national courts of EU countries, are known for vigorously enforcing international obligations (at least by global standards).\u00a0<strong>EU countries regularly comply with court orders to fulfill their obligations under the ICESCR</strong>. These court orders frequently require governments to change their budgets to meet the economic and social rights of their residents.\"</p>\n<p>I was actually thinking of a non-binding European decision-making body that is very influential but whose decisions are not mandatory. Additionally this body does not appear to rule on extraterritorial obligations since the European human rights system does not seem to include such obligations in their body of law.

{"date": "17th Oct 2015", "title": "Improving the Effectiveness of Effective Altruism Outreach", "author": "Gleb_T", "num_comments": "22 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><strong id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>As an Effective Altruist who is skilled at <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/gleb-tsipursky\">marketing, education, and outreach</a>, I think we can do a lot of good if we improve the effectiveness of Effective Altruism outreach. This is an issue that was touched on in a couple of recent forum posts (<a href=\"/ea/op/eas_image_problem/\">1</a>, <a href=\"/ea/or/making_effective_altruism_more_emotionally/\">2</a>), and I wanted to devote a separate piece to discussing it. I am not talking about <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vsQdWIcL1nWdTTdQtB4uH1f_rIjDo27-CwaZUnfqEG4/edit#heading=h.uwqwbvy38uwc\">EA pitches in particular</a>, although these are of course valuable in the right time and place, but more broadly issues of strategy. I am talking about making Effective Altruism outreach effective through relying on research-based strategies of effective outreach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To be clear, I should say that I have been putting my money/efforts where my mouth is, and devoting a lot of my time and energy to a project, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZrQVxW66eExFGiuB9UPNiIhingSq4leVyfaZKVVkLpY/edit?usp=sharing\">Intentional Insights</a>, of spreading rational thinking and effective altruism to a broad audience, as I think I can do the most good through convincing others to do the most good, through their giving and through rational thinking. Over the last year, I devoted approximately 2400 hours and $33000 to this project. Here's what I found helpful in my own outreach efforts to non-EAs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Telling_Stories\">Telling Stories</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p>I found it quite helpful to focus much more on speaking to people's emotions rather than their cognition. Now, this was not intuitive to me. I'm much more motivated by data than the typical person, and I bet you are too. But I think we need to remember that we suffer from a <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Typical_mind_fallacy\">typical mind fallacy</a>, in that most EAs are much more data-driven than the typical person. Moreover, after we got into the EA movement, we forget how weird it looks from the outside - we suffer from the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/83l/overcoming_the_curse_of_knowledge/\">curse of knowledge</a>.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Non-EAs usually give because of the pull of their heartstrings, not because of raw data on QALYs. Telling people emotional stories is a <a href=\"http://heathbrothers.com/books/made-to-stick/\">research-based strategy</a> to pull at heartstrings. So I practice doing so, about the children saved from malaria, of the benefits people gained from GiveDirectly, and other benefits. Then, the non-analytically inclined people become open to the numbers and metrics. However, the story is what opens people up to the numbers and metrics. This story helps address the <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm\">drowning child problem</a> and similar challenges.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, this is not sufficient if we want to get people into EA. Once they are open to the numbers and metrics through the story about a concrete and emotional example, it's very important to tell the story of Effective Altruism, to get people to engage with the movement. After leading with a story about children saved or something like that, I talk about how great it would be to save the most children most effectively. I paint a verbal and emotion-laden picture of how regrettable it is that the nonprofits that are best able to tell stories get the most money, not the nonprofits that are most effective. I talk about how people tend to give to nonprofits with the best marketing, not the ones that get the work done. This is meant to appeal to arouse negative emotions in people and put them before the essence of the problem that EA is trying to solve.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once they are in a state of negative emotional arousal about other charities, this is the best time to sell them on EA, I find. I talk to them about how EA offers a solution to their problem. It offers a way to evaluate charities based on their outcome, not on their marketing. They can trust EA sources as rigorous and data-driven. They can be confident in their decision-making based on GiveWell and other EA-vetted sources. Even if they don't understand the data-based analytical methodology, an issue I address below, they should still trust the outcomes. I'm currently drafting an article for a broad media forum, such as Huffington Post or something like that, which uses some of these strategies, and would be glad for feedback: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/950491455007212/\">link here</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Presenting_Data\">Presenting Data</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p>A big issue that many non-EAs have when presented with Effective Altruism is the barrier to entry to understanding data. For example, let's go to back to the example of saving children through malaria nets that I used earlier. What happens when I direct people to the major EA evaluation of Against Malaria Foundation, GiveWell's <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/amf\">write-up</a> on it? They get hit with a research paper, essentially. So many people who I directed there just get overwhelmed, as they do not have the skills to process it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'd suggest developing more user-friendly ways of presenting data. We know that our <a href=\"http://billiondollargraphics.com/infographics.html\">minds process visual information much quicker</a> and more effectively than text. So what about having infographics, charts, and other visual methods of presenting EA analyses? These can accompany the complex research-based analyses and give their results in an easy-to-digest visual format.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Social_Affiliation\">Social Affiliation</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p>Research shows that people desire <a href=\"http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/faculty/friedkin/Syllabi/Soc147/Week3Reading.pdf\">social affiliation</a> with people they like. This is part of the reason why as part of Intentional Insights, we are focusing on secular people as our first target audience.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>First, the vast majority of EAs are <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/sites/effectivealtruismhub.com/files/survey/2014/results-and-analysis.pdf\">secular</a>. This fact creates positive social signaling to secular people who are not currently EAs. Moreover, it is clear evidence that Effective Altruism appeals to them most. Second, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect\">network effects</a> cause it to be more likely for people who already became Effective Altruists to cause others in their contact networks to become EAs. Therefore, it pays well and is highly effective in terms of resource investment to focus on secular people, as they can get others in their social circles to become EAs. Third, the presence of prominent notables who are EAs allows good promotion through a desire to be socially affiliated with prominent secular notables. Here's an example of how I did it in <a href=\"http://intentionalinsights.org/meaning-purpose-and-civic-engagement-beyond-belief\">a blog post</a> for Intentional Insights.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are so many secular people and if we can get more of them into the EA movement, it would be great! To be clear, this is not an argument against reaching out to religious EAs, which is a worthwhile project in and of itself. This is just a point about effectiveness and where to spend resources for outreach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Meta_Comments_About_Outreach\">Meta-Comments About Outreach</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<div>These are just some specific strategies. I think we need to be much more intentional about our communication to non-EAs. We need to develop guidelines for how to communicate to people who are not intuitively rational about their donations.\u00a0</div>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To do so, I think we need to focus much more efforts - time and money - on developing Effective Altruist outreach and communication (this is why I am trying to fill the gap here with my own project). We haven't done nearly enough research or experimentation on how to grow the movement most effectively through communicating effectively to outsiders. Investing resources in this area would be a very low-hanging fruit with very high returns, I think.

While we could not find evidence for our hypotheses, the exploratory data analysis yielded a ranking of the levels of motivation and curiosity our prompts\u00a0induced. (<a href=\"http://claviger.net/effective-altruism-outreach-survey.html\">Cross-posted from my blog.</a>)</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"Topic\">Topic</h2>\n<p>The aim of our survey was to determine what form of effective altruism outreach was most effective for what type of\u00a0audience.</p>\n<p>As types of outreach, we\u00a0distinguished:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the \u201cobligation style,\u201d which aims to reveal altruistic values in people by helping them overcome biases, a style that is epitomized by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Diuv3XZQXyc\">Peter Singer</a>\u2019s Child in the Pond analogy,\u00a0and</li>\n<li>the \u201copportunity style,\u201d which assumes that people are altruistic and helps them overcome biases that keep them locked in lethargy anyway, a style that is epitomized by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGAkrpwyu1k\">Toby Ord</a>\u2019s appeal that people can save hundreds of lives over their lifetime if they invest their money\u00a0wisely. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Styles that we did not investigate are the usage of humor to better convey topics that would otherwise be met by defensiveness (suggested by <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/People.aspx\">Rob Mather</a>) and a style that is similar to the opportunity style but puts a stronger emphasis on personal discovery, as in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0VrZPBskpg\">Melanie Joy</a>\u2019s <span>TED</span>\u00a0talk.</p>\n<p>Such an evaluation could help any group engaged in effective altruism outreach to communicate more effectively with their respective\u00a0audiences.</p>\n<p>Our hypotheses\u00a0were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The obligation style leads to defensiveness, which would effect negative reaction at least in the short term and at least from less rationally-minded people. (If it is also more emotionally salient, later reflection might still make it more effective, but we cannot measure\u00a0that.)</li>\n<li>The opportunity style has a positive effect but only on people who already show a strong altruistic\u00a0inclination.</li>\n<li>Pitches targeted at specific demographics have a stronger effect on these people than on\u00a0others.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>On the exploratory side, we were also interested in the correlation between rational inclination and respondents\u2019 trust in their intuition, and their attitude toward our prompts, as well as any correlation between respondents\u2019 reaction to the prompts and the degree to which the prompts informed them or withheld information, as teasers\u00a0do.</p>\n<p>Since we could not find evidence of these correlations, it would be interesting to see whether others can. Additionally, there are a number of prompts that seem very powerful that we did not include (e.g., a comparison of prioritization with triage). A different sample might be more representative of the taxonomy. A qualitative study might also shed more light on the way people react to our\u00a0prompts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Design_and_Implementation\">Design and\u00a0Implementation</h2>\n<p>One of our worries was that if obligation-style prompts really make people defensive, then there is the risk of this defensiveness coloring the responses to later prompts. Hence we introduced a page break and sorted the critical prompts to the second page of the\u00a0two.</p>\n<p>The length of the prompts, especially the one\u2019s borrowed from Peter Singer, was another problem. We slightly shortened them where possible and otherwise reduced the number of prompts from originally eight per category to five. In the interest of reducing the number of fields people have to tick, we removed a scale for how much people like a prompt, which we found\u00a0dispensable.</p>\n<p>To measure rational and experiential (intuition-related) proclivities, we relied on the Rational-Experiential Inventory (<span>REI</span>) with 10 prompts by Norris, Pacini, and Epstein (1998). To measure altruistic inclination, we selected 10 prompts from the Adapted Self-Report Altruism Scale by Rushton (original, 1981), Witt and Boleman (adapted version,\u00a02009).</p>\n<p>Just as these two scales, our prompts also relied on five-item Likert\u00a0scales.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://claviger.net/assets/outreach-survey.html\">The full survey and recruitment letter can be found\u00a0here.</a></p>\n<p>We at first used the original Rushton scale, but after receiving 15 responses switched to the modified one, which meant turning sentences from present perfect into conditional (\u201cI have donated blood\u201d became \u201cI would donate blood.\u201d). The change is fairly localized, the responses obtained after the change greatly outnumber those obtained before, and we did not see any noticeable differences in the spread of the answers, so we decided to include the first 15 in our final\u00a0analysis.</p>\n<p>We advertised the survey on Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook, also using paid advertisement on Facebook to reach more people. Most, however, were recruited through an email a friend send to a mailing list of the Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin. We tried to counterbalance and get more people without academic background into our sample by targeting younger people on Facebook, but we only recruited only about 26 people that way (at a rate of almost \u20ac1 per person), as opposed to 85 via the mailing\u00a0list.</p>\n<p>Please contact us if you would like to play around with the raw\u00a0data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Analysis\">Analysis</h2>\n<p>Our R script for cleaning and analysis can be found in this <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/snippets/Telofy/Mb4pE\">Bitbucket snippet</a>.</p>\n<p>After a first section of type conversions and reversal of questions that were asked in the negative for validation purposes, we engaged in the controversial practice of interpreting the ordinal Likert items as interval scale to compute means. This would imply that the differences between the five options we gave are identical. We have no basis for this assumption, and the results should be taken with the appropriate absolute-scale number of grains of\u00a0salt.</p>\n<p>Apart from more cleaning, we also combined answers into categories that seem intuitive enough to us to not be motivated by the data. However, we have seen the data before deciding on the categories in all cases except for political views. The intervals used for the respondents age are not ours but intervals often used in the literature. These coarser categories allowed us to compensate for the low sample sizes per\u00a0cohort.</p>\n<p>Finally the script produces some eighty\u00a0graphs.</p>\n<p>When the analyses showed that we could find evidence for none of our hypotheses, we engaged in exploratory data analysis, the results of which are detailed in the\u00a0following.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Evaluation\">Evaluation</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://claviger.net/images/all.png\" alt=\"Full ranking\"></p>\n<p>Exploratory data analysis has the inevitable drawback that in all likelihood we\u2019ll find significant-looking correlations in our data simply by\u00a0chance.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless the overall ranking of the prompts, prompts that we asked our respondents to rate along scales of curiosity and motivation they either induced or failed to induce, has the power of our full sample size of 167 behind it, so that we\u2019re somewhat confident that conclusions drawn about prompts close to its extreme points are\u00a0valuable.</p>\n<p>The graph above shows the distribution of respondents\u2019 votes with the prompts described by a key where the first is a keyword that makes clear which prompt is meant, the second part is our taxonomy of whether the prompt focuses on the donor\u2019s opportunity or moral obligation, the third part is either \u201cinfo\u201d or \u201cteaser\u201d depending on whether the prompt explains something or withholds information, and the fourth part indicates whether the respondent gauged their motivation or their curiosity. The first and last part are restrictive while the second and third are\u00a0descriptive.</p>\n<p>There are also some post-hoc rationalizations that make the rankings of the top prompts\u00a0plausible.</p>\n<p>The absolute top prompt in terms of motivation and curiosity is Peter Singer\u2019s famous Child in the Pond analogy, which would probably not have made it into our survey had it not proved its persuasive power by turning Singer\u2019s essay \u201cFamine, Affluence, and Morality\u201d into a seminal paper of moral philosophy well-known to philosophers\u00a0worldwide.</p>\n<p>The third place is a slightly adapted version of the sentence that Giving What We Can uses as one of their slogans, \u201cStudies have found that top charities are up to a thousand times more effective than others,\u201d except that the organization omits the weasel words \u201cstudies have found.\u201d It is also a time-tested\u00a0prompt.</p>\n<p>The fourth place is an almost verbatim quote from Toby Ord\u2019s <span>TED</span> talk and surely a statement that the Giving What We Can founder has honed in hundreds of conversations with potential pledge-takers: \u201cYou can save someone\u2019s life without even changing your\u00a0career.\u201d</p>\n<p>The final spots in the ranking can be explained as an aversive reaction to an insulting prompt. Interestingly, the rather popular prompt comparing the training of a guide dog to sight-restoring surgery ranks very low in terms of the motivation it\u00a0induces.</p>\n<p>Threats to our external validity are that we have in our\u00a0sample:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3.7 times as many academics than people who only graduated school if you count as academics anyone who has visited a university or college irrespective of whether they\u2019ve attained a degree\u00a0yet,</li>\n<li>3 times as many nonreligious than religious respondents, and a mean age of 25 (\u03c3=7) with only two respondents over\u00a045.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are likely more biases that we can\u2019t\u00a0recognize.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Main_Hypotheses\">Main\u00a0Hypotheses</h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://claviger.net/images/all.mean.matrix.png\" alt=\"Scatter plots\"></p>\n<p>In our data exploration, we have generated over eighty graphs that can be found in <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_EGIYnWjWAvfmRnTGJWdWhVTzVBUl93TnRaQWM5NS1DX3ctWXpsWXVlM3J0cXBqN1h2YmM\">this gallery</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on experiences in the Less Wrong community and <a href=\"http://reg-charity.org/\"><span>REG</span></a>\u2019s experiences with poker players as well as our inside view of the effective altruism movement itself, we expected to see a clear correlation between rationality and effective altruism inclination (the \u201call\u201d vs. \u201crational\u201d plots\u00a0above).</p>\n<p>We did not expect to see such a clear correlation with our data on the respondents\u2019 altruism inclination (the \u201call\u201d vs. \u201caltruistic\u201d plots above), because it tested very elementary, naive empathetic skill, which may be necessary to a degree but is otherwise unhelpful for understanding effective\u00a0altruism.</p>\n<p>Neither correlation showed. Not even the square root of the product of the two features was correlated with responses to our prompts. If these results can be taken at face value, then it seems to us that rationality and altruism may be little more than necessary conditions for becoming effective altruism, and that something else is just as necessary\u2014maybe the principle of \u201ctaking ideas seriously,\u201d which is common on Less Wrong, or any number of other such traits. But the results are probably more likely to be\u00a0meaningless.</p>\n<p>The strong correlations between \u201caltruistic\u201d and the two <span>REI</span> dimensions may be just artifacts of people\u2019s different inclinations to answer Likert scales with extreme or moderate values. Surprisingly, however, the same tendency is not evident between the two <span>REI</span> dimensions. Perhaps they are sufficiently contradictory to offset this tendency. Please let us know when you have other\u00a0explanations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Qualitative_Results\">Qualitative\u00a0Results</h3>\n<p>The only nonquantitative question in our survey was the one asking for comments and suggestions. A few interesting\u00a0comments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>One respondent made the good point that the questions that focus on opportunities in effective altruism put the donor at the center rather than the beneficiary, something that to change is a crucial part of effective\u00a0altruism.</li>\n<li>Five respondents made suggestions that seemed to go in the opposite direction (though that is my interpretation), largely for pragmatic purposes. Two of them seemed take this position despite seeming fairly aware of the privilege of their\u00a0birth.</li>\n<li>One respondent said fairly directly that the distance of suffering was morally relevant to\u00a0them.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>While we could not find evidence for our hypotheses, we were able to generate a ranking of prompts commonly used by effective altruists of to how much motivation and curiosity they induce according to self-report. Due to biases in our sample, the external validity of these results is probably higher for populations of academics than the general\u00a0population.</p></div></div>"},

For instance Bostrom starts his Hail Mary paper: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>In the field of superintelligence control studies, which focuses on how to ensure that a hypothetical future superintelligent system would be safe and beneficial, two broad classes of approaches to the control problem can be distinguished: capability control methods and value selection methods.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>In seven words and a stroke of genius, he created a precedent that I find of immense value. He created a field of study. I have already cited this passage in papers and writings of mine, and now others too can refer to superintelligence control as a field. My conversations with Stuart Russell (and many grad students) have the goal of creating an AI safety engineering course at Berkeley, to set the precedent for some of the 1500+ universities that use his AIMA textbook to also have that course. You can imagine how happy I was to see the first words of Bostrom\u2019s paper. I literally grinned for some ten seconds.

Thanks!</p>\n<h2 id=\"Context\">Context</h2>\n<p>This exercise is aimed at understanding whether we can expect EA as a movement to be net positive, sustainable, coherent etc. and what kind of internal institutions or practices might need to be developed to increase our probabilities with respect to expected long term positive impact.</p>\n<p>A friend drew a parallel between early christian church wrt roman empire and EA wrt modern liberal democracy. He was worried that the values drift in EA would be at least as large as that with the early church and its adoption by the roman empire, and later by other socio-political groups. I thought this was worth writing about - and want to see if there are other parallels like this that we can come up with collectively before exploring them a bit more.</p>\n<p>There have also been two helpful posts on here recently. One, Ben West's piece on the value of <a href=\"/ea/ii/you_are_a_lottery_ticket/\">reference class forecasting</a>, and the other Owen Cotton-Barrett's article on <a href=\"/ea/is/how_valuable_is_movement_growth/\">the value of movement growth</a>.</p>\n<p>The first indicates that effective bench-marking is a powerful way to think about what will work going forwards. This, admittedly, is hard to do for historical movements as most movements the size of EA at the moment will probably have not been recorded - so there's a large class of 'failures' we'll never know about. However, I still think that getting a decent class and looking at how they developed and how society responded to them will tell us a lot.</p>\n<p>The second outlines why getting a better understanding of movement growth dynamics is pressing, and indicates a few key questions that we will want to ask once we have our data: how wary should we be of controversy? How has gaining traction worked in terms of garnering inclination?</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "5th Jun 2015", "title": "[Discussion] Are academic papers a terrible discussion forum for effective altruists?", "author": "RyanCarey", "num_comments": "6 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0mxDXI8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>A few years ago, Alyssa Vance posted a <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/d5y/why_academic_papers_are_a_terrible_discussion/\">bunch of reasons</a> that academic papers are an imperfect forum for discussion of topics such as those of interest to LessWrong. Lots of the reasons might apply to effective altruism too:</p>\n<p><em></em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><em><em>The time lag is huge; it's measured in months, or even years.</em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em>Most academic publications are inaccessible outside universities.</em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em>Virtually no one reads most academic publications.</em></em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em><em>It's very unusual to make successful philosophical arguments in paper form.</em></em></em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em><em>Papers don't have prestige outside a narrow subset of society.</em></em></em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em><em><em>Getting people to read papers is difficult.</em></em></em></em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Academia selects for conformity.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>The current community isn't academic in origin.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Our ideas aren't academic in origin.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Papers have a tradition of violating the\u00a0<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/js/the_bottom_line/\">bottom line</a>\u00a0rule.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><span><em>Academic moderation is both very strict and badly run.</em></span></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of these, four is debateable and eight is less true for effective altruism than for LessWrong. But the rest seem as true and pertinent for today's effective altruists as they were for the author.</p>\n<p>Diego Caleiro recently suggested that books might be superior to papers for promoting his ideas.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Books] are long enough to convey interesting ideas (of a more philosophical type) second, though they also follow exponential distributions, there are several marketing strategies that can aid publication and increase number of readers. They can be, like papers and unlike blogs, cited as decent academic evidence in good standing. They can be monetized as well, whereas one must pay to publish papers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He continues to put his point in the strongest possible terms:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am glad to hear counterarguments, because as it stands, this seems like the ultimate no-brainer, there is not a single thing papers are better than books for.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of readers</li>\n<li>Conveying complex ideas</li>\n<li>Getting feedback on ideas</li>\n<li>Money</li>\n<li>Career prospects</li>\n<li>Author's name being remembered and sought after</li>\n<li>Resilience over long stretches of time</li>\n<li>Compatibility with Technological advances (current and expected)</li>\n<li>Odds of finding collaborators in virtue of having written them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>...\u00a0The few properties like \"peer feedback\" and \"short and easier to write\" that papers beat books at have are completely dominated by blogging, 'specially on public science or philosophy blogs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So are books simply superior to academic papers for conveying world-changing ideas? Now that people have been trying to advance the case for the importance of safe development of artificial intelligence (arguably one of the most important ideas, and one that has been quite controversial), we can ask which texts have most helped to advance that idea so far.</p>\n<p>Instinctually, Bostrom's book Superintelligence seems to have been most helpeful for this. Although it has only been <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=oQwpz3QAAAAJ&amp;cstart=20&amp;citation_for_view=oQwpz3QAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC\">moderately cited,</a> it's influence was felt in the discussions that it provoked from Musk, Hawking, Wozniak and an array of other scientists and technologists. It was also a bestseller, and seems to have been a major contributor to the change in discourse on this topic in the last couple of years. The book stood out as a landmark event. The Puerto Rico was similarly groundbreaking - both helped grow the reach of Bostrom's ideas in a way that dozens of papers would not (and had not).</p>\n<p>Rather, Bostrom's papers have tended to be nonconformist, and their degree of readership and reputation has suffered from this to a greater degree than his new book. In two other points of concern to Alyssa Vance, his book was also more widely available, and was accessed in much wider parts of society. It was also advantaged on some counts raised by Diego: it allowed Bostrom to convey unusually complex ideas, and made his name more well-known.</p>\n<p>The example of AI safety seems to speak to the value of books and in-person conversation.</p>\n<p>If we look at the founding of CEA, we see a similar story, of initial connections being made between Toby Ord and William MacAskill, as well as with some in-person student groups at Oxford University. Even though the context was academic, journals were not the main mode of passing information or inspiration. However, it journalistic publication does seem to have helped people like Ord and MacAskill to earn a living and maintain their academic career prospects. Moreover, in the cases of Bostrom and CEA, it may have been valuable to gain a significant academic reputation before performing outreach activities. Such would certainly be the case for Peter Singer, who also admittedly gained most of his eventual reputation through books.</p>\n<p>So academic papers aren't generating big breakthroughs in interest, but a lot of the leading thinkers tend to be academics.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So how helpful does being an academic seem to be? Well, it's not strictly necessary. If we look at the inception of MIRI (when it was the Singularity Institute), we see Eliezer, who was writing on online messageboards, and was allergic to academia. Despite often writing in a way that was technical and informed by science, he was not in any academic role, and had no academic prestige. Eliezer is as always a bit of an anomaly, though, as his writing talents have repeatedly proven to be extremely popular, and this may have allowed his writing to cut through in the absence of academic status. If you look somewhere like <a href=\"http://edge.org/\">Edge</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/\">TED</a> or <a href=\"http://bigthink.com/\">Big Think</a> a lot leading public intellectuals and writers are academics. However, it's hard to discern the causation. It could be that academia is equipping them to better promote their useful thoughts, or it could just be that academia sucks in more than its share of the best thinkers in the first place.</p>\n<p>So what reasons do we see for writing academic papers? For a start, they can help one to identify an academic expert, which is possibly useful. MIRI, CSER, FHI and others derive a lot of their reputation (which in turn gives them some political and persuasive strength) in this way, as have Ord and Bostrom, and this might be good for anyone who wants to be a public intellectual. Another reason to write academic papers would be to be able to point to the existence of an academic field. This seems to be what MIRI wants to be able to do - to point technical and conscientious AI researchers to such a body of work. These kinds of investments will not pay off for some time, and may prove hard to evaluate. For the rest of us, why write papers? Well, it could be strategically useful for those who wish to secure an otherwise undemanding professorial position. They might help us secure a research-based job. But otherwise, and especially from an altruistic point of view, they don't seem to do much. So Alyssa and Diego's reservations about the value of papers seem pretty compelling to me.</p></div></div>"},

New uniforms, you figure, will boost their self-esteem and lead others to think better of them, too!</p>\n<p>A week later, you get a call from the coach. The team really appreciates your donation, she explains, and the uniforms were really great, but they had just received a donation of new jerseys the year before; what they really needed were new bats and balls to practice with\u2014which they could have bought with a few hundred dollars. And as you hang up the phone, you ask yourself: \u201cHave I done something wrong here?\u201d</p>\n<p>The team is not worse off than if you had made no donation at all, but they certainly could have been better off if you had taken the time to figure out what they needed most. Or maybe if you had done your research, you would have realized that the team across town doesn\u2019t have any uniforms\u2014or bats or balls\u2014at all.</p>\n<p>But: Have you done anything\u00a0wrong?</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/5e/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/\">\u201cEffective</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism\">altruism\u201d</a>\u00a0is a social movement grounded in the idea that when we aim to do good, we should consider who needs our help most\u2014and what sort of help they need. Most recently, Eric Posner of Slate\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2015/03/effective_altruism_critique_few_charities_stand_up_to_rational_evaluation.html\">has opined against this idea</a>\u00a0on the grounds that children living in other countries are almost always more needy than First-World Little-Leaguers, and \u201c[d]onating to Little League [should] not make you a moral monster.\u201d And while I agree with his quip, I think he has\u00a0fundamentally misunderstood effective altruism, at least as it is practiced by the people I know.</p>\n<p>Posner\u2019s critique comes in two parts. First, he\u00a0is pessimistic that\u00a0any\u00a0altruism can be effective, concluding, \u201cThe most good you can do may turn out to be\u2014not much.\u201d He cites several\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w11513\">studies</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/255.short\">critical</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143038826/\">of</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-008-9032-8\">aid</a>\u00a0and references\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/world/africa/mosquito-nets-for-malaria-spawn-new-epidemic-overfishing.html\">a recent\u00a0New York Times\u00a0story</a>\u00a0about insecticide-treated bednets (intended to be hung over beds to deter malaria-carrying mosquitoes and often touted as one of the most cost-effective public-health interventions) being misused as fishing nets, poisoning lakes and rivers.</p>\n<p>But these failures of aid\u00a0highlight\u00a0the importance of institutions like\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>, whose rigorous research avoids Posner\u2019s pitfalls. Long before the\u00a0Times\u00a0broke their story about bednet misuse,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#followup\">GiveWell researchers investigated</a>\u00a0whether bednets were\u00a0actually\u00a0hung up properly 6, 15, and 24 months after distribution; in fact, one of the reasons GiveWell\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF\">recommended the Against Malaria Foundation</a>\u00a0(AMF) over other net distributors is that the\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/02/05/putting-the-problem-of-bed-nets-used-for-fishing-in-perspective/\">AMF relies on in-person, unannounced checks, instead of self-reported surveys</a>\u00a0to gauge net use.\u00a0(The AMF, through malaria-education programs and these unannounced checks, achieves proper-usage rates of\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/02/05/putting-the-problem-of-bed-nets-used-for-fishing-in-perspective/\">80 to 90 percent</a>, with misuse rates half those of other net distributors.)</p>\n<p>Posner makes further arguments about the efficacy of aid that certainly merit empirical discussion, but in many ways, the more interesting critique in his piece is the moral one. To quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Suppose you donate $5,000 to the local Little League so that it can buy baseball equipment for poor children. You might feel good about yourself, but an effective altruist will realize that this amount of money could be used to buy malaria nets or medicine that would save as many as five lives\u00a0in a poor country. Then you should ask yourself: Which is better, some kids playing baseball or some kids getting a chance at life? Or put differently, should you really let children in Niger die so that some First World kids get to play baseball?</p>\n<p>This, of course, was the point of the story I began with, in which a person chooses to remove garbage from the pond rather than save the child. If we think that person is a monster, then we should regard nearly everyone as monsters. All of us who donate money to Little League baseball, environmental causes, schools, universities, and art museums are moral monsters because we don\u2019t use that money to provide live-saving health care to the poorest people in the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Posner disagrees and is convinced that this tendency toward scrupulosity is enough of an issue that we should abandon the concept of effectiveness in altruism entirely. His critique, though, is not a new one\u2014several effective altruists are\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unequallyyoked/2014/08/purity-anxiety-and-effective-altruism.html\">also</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/03/23/in-praise-of-ineffective-altruism/\">concerned</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/2014/10/aim-high-even-if-you-fall-short.html\">about</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/10/infinite-debt/\">scrupulosity</a>, and many of them have shared stories from their own lives about balancing giving effectively against more personal cares. For me, these stories are important because they demonstrate that caring about effective opportunities to do good is not mutually exclusive with making the world better in other ways you choose.</p>\n<p>First, Holden Karnofsky, co-founder of GiveWell,\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/20/excited-altruism/\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[S]uch people fundamentally misunderstand effective altruism \u2026 [T]hey imagine that we have passions for particular causes, and are trying to submerge our passions in the service of rationality. That isn\u2019t the case. Rather,\u00a0effective altruism is what we are passionate about. We\u2019re excited by the idea of making the most of our resources and helping others as much as possible\u2026</p>\n<p>[T]his doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m willing to give up everything else I value and enjoy for effective altruism\u2014I\u2019m not. But when I\u2019m engaged in altruism-oriented activities, I want to be fully engaged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing unusual,\u201d\u00a0he writes in the same essay, \u201cabout caring a great deal about such an interest; giving up some tangible things \u2026 and using intellectual reasoning in pursuing [it].\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaj Sotala,\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/8h/effective_altruism_as_the_most_exciting_cause_in/\">writing on the Effective Altruism Forum</a>, a community blog, also sees the central message of effective altruism as one of\u00a0opportunity, not of obligation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Growing up \u2026 the message I got from society was: one person just can\u2019t do much. The problems in the world are huge and structural, and naive reformers will eventually just become disillusioned and burn out. We can try to make small efforts in our personal lives, but they\u2019re tiny and won\u2019t scale.</p>\n<p>Effective altruism says that this doesn\u2019t need to be true! Yes, some of the problems are huge and structural, but that doesn\u2019t mean that individuals can\u2019t have a big impact. The average person working in an ordinary job can potentially save\u00a0several lives a year, just by donating a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/what-you-can-achieve\">measly 10% of her income</a>! That would already be amazing by itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A year ago,\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.rossry.net/tag/ogps/\">I volunteered to co-coach an afterschool robotics club</a>\u00a0in an inner-city Boston middle school. It was an enormously rewarding experience\u2014but at times, I did find myself asking whether I was really going to have any lasting impact on those eight students\u2019 lives. By contrast, when\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.rossry.net/nontrivially-improved-future/\">I decided to donate ten percent</a>\u00a0of my summer internship\u2019s salary to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell\u2019s top recommended charities</a>, I felt less of a warm glow, but was much more sure my choice had actually changed the lives of the people it touched.\u00a0And that, it seemed, was closer to the real point of altruism\u2014after all, was I in this to help other people, or to make myself feel good?</p>\n<p>Is there something wrong with donating uniforms instead of balls to the Little League, since you are more likely to feel a swell of pride when you see them take the field wearing the gift you gave them?</p>\n<p>Or, assuming you do have\u00a0passions and\u00a0connections\u00a0in your local community,\u00a0does effective altruism leave a way to balance the personal with the effective?\u00a0Is there any time to, say, bake cookies for a friend, if that time could instead be spent in the office, earning money to donate to those in need? Are you morally monstrous for not abandonning your friends entirely for the more needy?</p>\n<p>Leah Libresco, an effective altruist, blogger, and news writer for FiveThirtyEight,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unequallyyoked/2015/03/effective-altruism-ethically-questionable-cookies.html\">asks this very question</a>,\u00a0and explains where she finds her balance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I also care about\u00a0offering an icon of the world I want to build.\u00a0On the day that malaria joins smallpox and rinderpest in the graveyard of eradicated diseases, I\u2019ll be happy, but not satisfied. I want people to have freedom from disease and crippling poverty so they have more freedom to live with and for others. I want to put some, but not all of my resources to building up the lower levels of\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\">Maslow\u2019s hierarchy</a>, but I want to reserve something to build up and live the kind of life I want people to have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unequallyyoked/2015/03/7qt-matched-donations-fiancees-and-symmetries.html#qt1\">Elsewhere</a>, Libresco says of her decision to donate to a friend\u2019s medical fundraiser:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I gave to their fundraiser and then matched the donation with one to Against Malaria\u2014GiveWell\u2019s top ranked charity\u2014so that the need of people I already know and care for can be a spur to give to people I don\u2019t (and won\u2019t) know personally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And most effective altruists, whom Posner would stereotype as sacrificing everything in life to blindly maximize their ability to donate, turn the same philosophy of balance to life\u2019s largest decisions as well. Julia Wise, an effective altruist blogger and social worker,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/cheerfully.html\">describes her choice with her husband to have a child</a>, even knowing that the expense would leave them less able to donate to the causes they support:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Immediately after we gave ourselves permission to be parents, I was excited about the future again\u2026 And I suspect that feeling of satisfaction with my own life lets me be more help to the world than I would have as a broken-down altruist.</p>\n<p>So test your boundaries, and see what changes you can make that will help others without costing you too dearly. But when you find something is making you bitter, stop. Effective altruism is not about driving yourself to a breakdown. We don\u2019t need people making sacrifices that leave them drained and miserable. We need people who can [, as in the traditional Quaker saying,] \u201cwalk cheerfully over the world,\u201d\u00a0or at least do their damnedest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/2014/03/the-other-mother.html\">Elsewhere</a>, Wise explains how motherhood has given her new ways to think about caring for those whom she can help and strengthened her commitment to effective altruism.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Effective altruism, for Karnofsky, Solata, Libresco, Wise, and for me, is an opportunity and a question (I can help! How and where am I needed?), not an obligation and an ideology (You are a monster unless you help\u00a0this way!), and it certainly does not demand that you sacrifice your own happiness to utilitarian ends. It doesn\u2019t ask anyone to \u201cgive until it hurts\u201d; an important piece of living to help others is setting aside enough money to live comfortably (and\u00a0happily) first,\u00a0and not feeling bad about living on that. Obviously, if you are aspiring to do good, you shouldn\u2019t throw your money away thoughtlessly (since $10 saved\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/Donation.aspx\">can buy bednets</a>\u00a0to protect a family of four), but every effective altruist I know does set aside some piece of their personal budget for no other purpose than keeping themselves\u2014and those around them\u2014happy. And since giving money away is one of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_norton_how_to_buy_happiness\">the</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/thisemotionallife/blogs/can-money-really-buy-happiness\">best</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/6078101/giving-money-away-makes-us-happy\">ways</a>\u00a0to buy happiness, then yes\u2014that includes donating to the Little League!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "5th Apr 2015", "title": "Earning to Give: Programming Language Choice", "author": "Ben_West", "num_comments": "14 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Several people have asked me recently about what language they should learn first. This article is intended to be a single point of reference for all those conversations, as well as sparking input from other people who know about the subject.</p>\n<p>My answer is usually:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Salary differences between languages are small enough that you should care more about other aspects of the process (e.g. if the boot camp makes guarantees about you getting a job) more than the specific language, but</li>\n<li>Front-end (developing things that the user sees) pays less than backend</li>\n<li>Keep standard 80,000 Hours advice in mind, like that it's better to explore many options in the beginning of your career than optimize for just one</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"More_Detail\">More Detail</h1>\n<p>Below is a table of programming language popularity (taken from <a href=\"http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html\">TIOBE</a>) along with data from two salary surveys. You can see that the variance within one language across the different surveys is about the same as the difference across languages within one survey (119 vs. 131/76), which indicates that geographic factors, company size/type, years of experience etc. are probably more of a concern than the specific language. This fits with my anecdotal experience.</p>\n<p>The argument for backend development is mostly due to oversupply of front-end developers: there are a lot of graphic designers, artists etc. who learn a little bit of HTML and JavaScript so that they can get a job doing front-end.

{"date": "11th Feb 2015", "title": "4 Common (Hedonic) Prediction Failures and How to Fix Them", "author": "PeterMcIntyre", "num_comments": "1 comment", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://rationality.org/blog/\">CFAR's blog</a> about the errors we make in hedonic prospecting. It was based on Gilbert and Wilson's 2007 review article of the topic.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our predictions fail in predictably bad ways. Picture the last time you were getting ready to leave the house and you were asked how much longer you would take. And when was the last time you actually left by then? You might be better at this than I am, but I have struggled with forecasting how long it will take. My dad used to account for this, and pretended we needed to leave 15 minutes before we actually did. Without knowing, my dad was accounting for Hofstadter's Law:</p>\n<blockquote>It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.</blockquote>\n<p>\u2014 Douglas Hofstadter, G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</p>\n<p>What does it matter if we haven\u2019t left on time? That might well be sometimes inconsequential. But leaving on time is easy compared to plenty of other predictions you need to make, that <em>do</em> matter. How much will I enjoy my new job? Should I move to sunny California? Should I buy that lottery ticket? Psychological science has made a lot of progress in determining where we systematically make inaccurate predictions. So where do we stumble?</p>\n<h2 id=\"1__Simulations_are_unrepresentative\">1. Simulations are unrepresentative</h2>\n<p>We tend extrapolate from tiny bits of data that are unrepresentative: We characterize an experience by its worst elements, and predict on that basis. For example, when people are asked to imagine missing a train in the future, they tend to remember their worst train-missing experience rather than their typical train-missing experience. They picture missing their train before that important meeting they had and being lambasted by their boss, not every other time they just caught the next one in a few minutes. The converse is also true: We idealize \u2018good\u2019 experiences by predicting, for instance, that moving to sunny California would change our lives, when, really, weather is only a small part of what makes us happy. Everyone remembers their best day, their worst day, and their yesterday.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2__Simulations_are_essentialized\"><strong>2. Simulations are essentialized</strong></h2>\n<p>We often only remember what we see as the essential pieces of an experience, not everything surrounding it. Participants asked about a recent theater experience, they only remembering the theater as being what's on stage, not the cold, the parking, the noise, and the interlude. Because accurate predictions are contingent on accurate memories, it\u2019s hard to get the final step right if the first one is in the wrong direction. Simulations of events omit inessential features, and people tend to predict that good events will be better and bad events will be worse than they actually turn out to be.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3__Simulations_are_abbreviated\"><strong>3. Simulations are abbreviated</strong></h2>\n<p><a> </a> Only thinking about a small portion of the experience can also get us into trouble. How happy would you be if you were to win the lottery? Ecstatic, right? What about 6 months down the track? Still incredibly happy, I\u2019m guessing? When Daniel Gilbert took a sample of people who had this happen to them, he found their happiness to be back at baseline within a few months, with a minor blip in between <a href=\"#%5B1%5D\">[1]</a>. So why is this? Turns out when you\u2019re predicting, you only think of day 1, not day 277 and we humans are remarkably good at adapting to our circumstances.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4__Simulations_are_decontextualized\"><strong>4. Simulations are decontextualized</strong></h2>\n<p><a> </a> When the context in which you make your prediction differs from the context of the event, problems arise. For instance, Gilbert, Gill, and Wilson <a href=\"#%5B2%5D\">[2]</a> found that hungry people predict they'd like spaghetti for breakfast, while sated people predict they'd dislike it for dinner. As you might have guessed, and running thematically with the rest of this article, they weren\u2019t very good at getting it right. Hungry participants overrated their enjoyment of a spaghetti breakfast, and full participants underrated their enjoyment of a spaghetti dinner.</p>\n<h2 id=\"So__what_can_we_do_about_them_\"><strong>So, what can we do about them?</strong></h2>\n<p>Daniel Gilbert and Timothy Wilson, academic psychologists who research this area, recommend we pretend the event is happening tomorrow and thinking through events hour per hour. So a nebulous desire of moving to California turns into thinking what will be different in every hour of waking up, getting ready, commuting, working, eating etc. And the difference might not amount to that much. This, he reasons, assists in making our predictions more concrete. Similarly, on a smaller scale, we can break everything down into its constituent steps. Think through each step of what you\u2019ll be doing, and try to avoid relying on your brain's associations with whole events. In an attempt to make decisions when you might be feeling differently, consider specific factors that might be altering your decision and account for them, or try to defer decision to when you're in a similar state. We should try, Gilbert recommends, shopping when you\u2019re not feeling so hungry, or pre-committing to doing that study before you change your mind, for instance.</p>\n<p>Can you predict how successful you\u2019ll be able to influence your predictions?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Notes\"><strong>Notes</strong></h2>\n<p><a>[1]</a>\u00a0Gilbert, D.

If you think that my last one is not ideal for your audience, then you can link them this one. I also published it <a href=\"http://claviger.net/effective-altruism-101.html\">on my own blog</a> including a video that I can\u2019t embed here.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<hr>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Overview\">Overview</h2>\n<p>If you want to do as much good as possible with your donations and other resources, then you may already be part of the effective altruism movement. The following ideas are central to the\u00a0movement:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Top charities make it cheap and easy for us to have a huge positive impact because they are ten, a hundred, or a thousand times more cost-effective than other charities.<sup><a href=\"#fn:dcp2\">1</a></sup><sup><a href=\"#fn:to-imp\">2</a></sup></li>\n<li>Hence, it is typically more important <em>where</em> we give than <em>what</em> we give, and empirical, scientific research lends great confidence to these giving\u00a0decisions.</li>\n<li>Consequently, most of us have the ability to save lives without even having to change our line of\u00a0work.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The following sections will explain these points in more detail, and the final one will give an overview of the\u00a0movement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Cost_Effectiveness\">Cost-Effectiveness</h2>\n<p>As children and probably as adults, most of us have wished to be life-savers and heroes like Batman, Blossom, or Buffy Summers\u2014to leave a mark on the world and an eminently good one at that. If they weren\u2019t fictional, these heroes could look back on their lives, see the permanent change for the better that they have effected, and feel proud of a life well\u00a0lived.</p>\n<p>Now some people discover a knack for professions such as doctor or lifeguard, others make inventions that improve the lives of millions, but none of these vocations have a monopoly on great positive\u00a0impact.</p>\n<p>The secret is one that every martial artist knows. If you\u2019re in a fight with mighty opponents such as extreme poverty, disease, and malnutrition in far-away countries, you might be tempted to beat them with pure force\u2014because, in fact, you have a lot of that. Most people who are likely to read this will have a one-in-ten, one-in-a-hundred, or even rarer <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i\">innate gift for giving</a> simply thanks to being born in a developed country with high earning potential, infrastructure, social security, a working health system, and much\u00a0more.</p>\n<p>Yet, if you want to win the fight with force alone it is still possible that your opponents will be stronger. Instead you can use your training: You elegantly side-step their attacks, anticipate the vectors of their momenta, and then throw them with just a gentle touch. That is what top charities allow us to\u00a0achieve.</p>\n<p>Top cost-effective charities, such as the ones listed below, provide the techniques that allow any donor to amplify their impact to the point where a few thousand dollar suffice to save a life. Thanks to them, effective altruism has been a breakthrough for many of us. In some cases we didn\u2019t know what impact our donations had, if any. In other cases we were used to being able to do some good with our donations. But by optimizing the cost-effectiveness of our altruism, we found that we could do as much good with a fraction of the money and have enough left to add orders of magnitude more good on top.</p>\n<p>Moreover, since they are among the best investments we can make with our money, these exciting opportunities have in many cases enticed us into donating more in addition to donating better and even choosing higher-earning careers to maximize what we can give\u2014all the while saving more lives and feeling exuberant about\u00a0it!</p>\n<h2 id=\"Intervention_Prioritization\">Intervention\u00a0Prioritization</h2>\n<p>How can you achieve such an enormous boost to your altruism?\u00a0Science!</p>\n<p>Cause areas such as extreme poverty, diseases, and forms of malnutrition can be addressed through a variety of interventions. Often it is possible to allocate a certain budget to an intervention, randomly select treatment and control groups, and afterwards compare what relative improvement the intervention has achieved at what cost. Such randomized controlled trials or RCTs and systematic reviews across them are as central to evidence-based altruism as they are for evidence-based\u00a0medicine.</p>\n<p>But the situation is more complex than that because charity can be a bit like the stock market. Once an amazing new intervention has proved itself, governments and major foundations often jump on it, pouring in enough money that the marginal benefit of further donations is low. A great giving opportunity is hence one that addresses an important cause, relies on a well-proven cost-effective intervention, and yet remains\u00a0underfunded.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Cause_Neutrality\">Cause\u00a0Neutrality</h2>\n<p>It is crucial to us to be unbiased about whom we help and never judge beings by the nature of their plight: all we want is to do as much good as possible. Hence we compare all interventions\u2014whether medical, educational, agricultural, vel sim.\u2014as well as we can, not just the ones within one\u00a0category.</p>\n<p>This means that organizations within the movement also investigate whether there are highly effective giving opportunities in areas that are usually deemed political. For example, opportunities within the <span>US</span> policy areas of labor mobility and criminal justice are being investigated by the <a href=\"http://www.openphilanthropy.org/\">Open Philanthropy Project</a>. It also investigates types of global catastrophic risk (also known as <em>existential risk</em>)\u2014such as biosecurity and geoengineering\u2014and what can be done to avert them. Investigations into giving opportunities in the area of scientific research funding are also on the\u00a0agenda.</p>\n<p>Cause neutrality also embraces nonhuman animals. There is no agreed-upon method for comparing the suffering of different species, but Animal Charity Evaluators estimates that the cost for saving the lives of farmed animals<sup><a href=\"#fn:ace-topcharities\">4</a></sup> might be four orders of magnitude less than that for saving human lives,<sup><a href=\"#fn:gw-ce\">3</a></sup> a consideration that might outweigh whatever lower value one might assign to the life of an animal. On the other hand, animals are much less likely to benefit from long-term flow-through effects.<sup><a href=\"#fn:ocb-animals\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>Weighing all these considerations is a mighty\u00a0undertaking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Charity_Evaluation\">Charity\u00a0Evaluation</h2>\n<p>Two organizations have put years of work into doing just that and more. <a href=\"http://givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> and <a href=\"http://animalcharityevaluators.org/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a> assess empirically which interventions excel in all these categories. Furthermore, they look for charities that implement these interventions in a fashion that is highly transparent, scalable, and subject to rigorous self-evaluation. The charities that stand all these tests are thus the world\u2019s best giving opportunities for\u00a0donors.</p>\n<p>The reliability of their evidence is paramount to GiveWell and Animal Charity Evaluators, and they go to great lengths to subject their reasoning to public scrutiny, so that they can continually\u00a0improve.</p>\n<h3 id=\"As_of_December_2014__GiveWell_recommends_\">As of December 2014, <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell</a>\u00a0recommends:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://againstmalaria.com/\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, which funds mosquito nets for malaria\u00a0prevention</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a>, which distributes cash to people in extreme\u00a0poverty</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto\">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a>, which treats people for parasite\u00a0infections</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.evidenceaction.org/dewormtheworld\">Deworm the World Initiative</a> of Evidence Action, which provides advocacy and technical assistance to governments to conduct\u00a0deworming.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"As_of_December_2014__Animal_Charity_Evaluators_recommends_\">As of December 2014, <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>\u00a0recommends:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.animalequality.net/\">Animal Equality</a>, which advocates for farmed animals through media outlets, grassroots outreach, undercover investigations, and legal and corporate\u00a0outreach</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mercyforanimals.org/\">Mercy For Animals</a>, which advocates for farmed animals through undercover investigations, corporate and legal outreach, online vegetarian ads, and grassroots\u00a0outreach</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thehumaneleague.com/\">The Humane League</a>, which advocates for farmed animals through online advertising, grassroots outreach, public campaigns, presentations, and corporate\u00a0outreach.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Resources\">Resources</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a> find the best charities in existence and publish each step of their\u00a0processes.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.openphilanthropy.org/\">Open Philanthropy Project</a> investigates promising giving opportunities including those that lie outside the focus of\u00a0GiveWell.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> accepts pledges from effective altruists who plan to donate at least 10% of their\u00a0income.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a> provides career coaching for everyone who wants their life to have the greatest possible positive\u00a0impact.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://charityscience.com/\">Charity Science</a> experiments with different ways to conduct outreach and\u00a0fund-raising.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/\">Effective Altruism Forum</a> can help you find answers to your\u00a0questions.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/\">Effective Altruists Facebook group</a> provides you with another forum for effective altruism\u00a0discussions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/\">Effective Altruism Hub</a> encourages you to be public about your donations to inspire\u00a0others.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li> <span>D.T.</span> Jamison et al., <a href=\"http://www.dcp-3.org/dcp2\"><em>Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries</em></a>, 2nd ed., <span>NCBI</span> bookshelf (World Bank Publications, 2006), 52, <span>ISBN</span>: 9780821361801.\u00a0<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\" href=\"#fnref:dcp2\">\u21a9</a> </li>\n<li> Toby Ord, \u201c<a href=\"/ea/70/the_moral_imperative_towards_costeffectiveness/\">The Moral Imperative Towards Cost-Effectiveness</a>,\u201d 2012.\u00a0<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text\" href=\"#fnref:to-imp\">\u21a9</a> </li>\n<li> GiveWell, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models\">GiveWell\u2019s Cost-Effectiveness Analyses</a>,\u201d 2014.\u00a0<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 3 in the text\" href=\"#fnref:gw-ce\">\u21a9</a> </li>\n<li> Animal Charity Evaluators, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/\">Top Charities</a>,\u201d 2014.\u00a0<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 4 in the text\" href=\"#fnref:ace-topcharities\">\u21a9</a> </li>\n<li> Owen Cotton-Barratt, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/6c/human_and_animal_interventions_the_longterm_view/\">Human and Animal Interventions: The Long-Term View</a>,\u201d 2014.\u00a0<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 5 in the text\" href=\"#fnref:ocb-animals\">\u21a9</a> </li>\n</ol></div></div></div>"},
{"date": "26th Dec 2015", "title": "Doing Good Better - Book review and comments", "author": "MichaelDello", "num_comments": "21 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>This is cross-posted from my blog <a href=\"https://michaeldello.wordpress.com/2015/12/26/doing-good-better-book-review/\">here</a>. Feel free to skip the intro, as it contains a very high level introduction to EA concepts.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>For anyone sleeping under an asteroid lately, a new movement by the name of Effective Altruism is slowly taking the world by storm. Put simply, EA involves thinking critically about which causes and charities to support. It may seem strange, but the differences between charities can be enormous, and it\u2019s not just about overhead and transparency.</p>\n<p>For example, it costs around $40,000 AU to train a guide dog to care for a blind person. Giving a person the ability to get around is a great thing to do, but a $60 donation to the Fred Hollows Foundation is enough to\u00a0<em>cure</em>\u00a0someone of blindness in a developing nation. For the cost of training one guide dog, we could cure over 600 cases of blindness. For some, this raises concerns about whether it\u2019s ok to say one charity or cause or life is worth more than another. But in reality, by not undertaking this comparison, you are saying that one life is worth more than 600 others. We have a remarkable opportunity to save a lot of lives by just changing how we think about charity. If you\u2019re still not convinced, I gave a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhYfxG_vVNQ\">presentation</a>\u00a0about this recently which introduces these ideas.</p>\n<p>This year has seen a number of Effective Altruism books being released, including\u00a0<em>The Most Good You Can Do</em>\u00a0by moral philosopher and co-founder of EA, Peter Singer, which is a good introduction.</p>\n<p>I recently finished reading\u00a0<em>Doing Good Better</em>\u00a0by William MacAskill, which dives into some of the less obvious ways that people can maximise the good they can do throughout their lives. I\u2019d like to take a bit of time to summarise the key themes of this book and give my thoughts.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Review_and_comments\">Review and comments</strong></p>\n<p>One new idea floating about is that it\u2019s possible to do a lot of good by working for a company that might typically be seen as unethical, such as a bank or finance company, rather than working directly for a non-profit. This is because, by working for a non-profit company, you are likely taking the job from someone else, almost as equally skilled as you, and so the marginal good you do is small. However, by working for a bank, you could earn a high salary, which you can donate to an effective charity. If you earn enough, you could donate enough to pay for the salary of several non-profit staff that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had jobs if you didn\u2019t donate that money. EAs call this \u2018earning to give\u2019. That\u2019s not to say that everyone should drop everything and work for the most evil corporation to earn a lot of money, just that it is another option. Some causes, like artificial intelligence research, are more talent constrained than funding constrained, so in some cases working for a non-profit is still better than donating to them.</p>\n<p>One activity that is often seen as a way of \u2018greenliving\u2019 is buying local produce, but unfortunately, the benefits of buying locally are often overstated. On average, only 10% of the emissions from food come from the transport, while 80% comes from the production. The effect of this is so strong that it is more effective to cut out red meat and dairy of one\u2019s diet one day a week than to buy entirely locally produced food. This isn\u2019t to say that buying local isn\u2019t a good thing to do, just that there are easier ways to reduce one\u2019s carbon footprint. This counterintuitive nature is a common theme with reducing carbon emissions. Leaving a phone plugged in for a whole year is equivalent in carbon emissions to having one hot bath, and leaving the TV on for the year is comparable to driving a car for just two hours.</p>\n<p>MacAskill proposes an even more effective way of reducing emissions.\u00a0Carbon offsetting\u00a0involves paying someone to reduce or avoid carbon emissions or to capture carbon, for example planting a tree. This isn\u2019t a new concept, though one carbon offsetting charity, Cool Earth, is particularly effective at this. Using analysis by William MacAskill and 80,000 Hours, even with the most conservative estimates it would only cost around $135 for the average Australian to offset their carbon emissions \u2013 for a whole year.</p>\n<p>People often tout catching a train as being a more environmentally friendly way to travel between cities. However, trains are usually significantly more expensive than flights for long distance travel, so you\u2019re almost certainly doing more good for the environment by flying somewhere and donating even half the savings to a carbon offsetting charity. Not to mention the time you\u2019d be saving, which if you were serious, could be used to do even more good for the environment.</p>\n<p>MacAskill also discusses the possibility of offsetting one\u2019s meat consumption. Charities such as The Humane League distribute advertising material to convince people to eat less meat, thereby reducing animal suffering and environmental damage. It costs about $100 to convince someone to stop eating meat for one year (or the equivalent reduction over multiple\u00a0people). If this is the case, would it be possible to donate\u00a0$100 to such a charity rather than go vegetarian, and be able to say it\u2019s the moral equivalent? What if you donate $200 a year, but eat meat. You\u2019ve essentially convinced two people to be vegetarian for the year. Is that better than eating being vegetarian but not donating?</p>\n<p>MacAskill\u2019s conclusion is \u201c<em>I don\u2019t think so. There\u2019s a crucial difference between greenhouse gas emissions and meat consumption: if you offset your greenhouse gas emissions, then you prevent anyone from ever being harmed by your emissions. In contrast, if you offset your meat consumption, you change which animals are harmed through factory farming. That makes eating meat and offsetting it less like offsetting greenhouse gas emissions and more like committing adultery and offsetting it, which we all agree it would be immoral to do.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not completely convinced by this. Let\u2019s try a thought experiment. Say that being vegetarian costs an extra $500 a year compared to eating meat, due to the food being more expensive (to be clear, it\u2019s not, a vegetarian diet can be substantially cheaper). If you were in a position to either donate that $500 to an effective animal advocacy charity and eat meat,\u00a0<em>or</em>\u00a0be vegetarian and donate nothing, would it really be acceptable to say that you would let so many more animals die because of your refusal to not eat meat? Now this is just the\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\">trolley problem</a>. You\u2019re changing who lives and dies in that situation, so why not this one?</p>\n<p>Now let me be slightly contradictory and say that, while I think eating meat and donating $100 to The Humane League would be morally equivalent to just not eating meat, I don\u2019t think that really excuses the meat consumption. We\u2019re not in the world of my above thought experiment, so ideally one should be vegetarian\u00a0<em>and\u00a0</em>donate to effective charities. Foreseeing potential criticism, I myself am vegan and donate to The Humane League.</p>\n<p>Related to this is my thoughts on vegans who regularly go out for fancy meals. If you are spending $500 more than you reasonably need to on\u00a0meals per year, I would argue that is potentially\u00a0less ethical\u00a0than a meat eater who only eats cheap meals and donates $500 to The Humane League every year. Morality doesn\u2019t begin and end with whether or not you eat meat. But after all this, I still believe that eating less or no meat is one of the easiest ways people can change their lives to do a lot of good. I appreciate that this is controversial, so I invite you to leave your thoughts or criticism in the comments below.</p>\n<p>On a related vein, MacAskill argues that ethical consumerism probably isn\u2019t as good as we think it is. If it costs $30 to buy an ethically produced shirt, and only $5 to buy one produced in a sweatshop, you\u2019re probably doing more good by buying the sweatshop shirt and donating the $25 savings to an organisation that advocates for workers rights. In fact, it\u2019s widely agreed by economists that sweatshops are, overall, good for poor countries. They are steady sources of income for many people in developing nations, and they probably wouldn\u2019t otherwise have jobs. By boycotting sweatshops, we just make things worse.</p>\n<p>In Will\u2019s words, \u201c<em>We should certainly feel outrage and horror at the conditions sweatshop labourers toil under. The correct response, however, is not to give up sweatshop-produced goods in favour of domestically produced goods. The correct response is to try to end the extreme poverty that makes sweatshops desirable places to work in the first place.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>When it comes to choosing a career, Will cautions against \u2018following your passion\u2019, which is a\u00a0common piece of career advice. This is bad advice for two reasons. One is that most people don\u2019t have passions that fit the world of work. The second is that your interests change. It\u2019s ok to realise after finishing a degree or working in a career for 10 years that it\u2019s not what you really enjoy or are good at, and to move on. The idea that people should know what they want to do for the rest of their life by the age of 18 is ludicrous.</p>\n<p>Considering the amount of time people spend working over a career, they spend comparatively little time thinking about what the best career for them really is. An organisation called\u00a0<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a>\u00a0is seeking to combat this by providing advice on finding personal fit for a career and reviewing careers for how much positive impact people can have within one. 80,000 is the number of hours the average person will spend working, yet most people spend substantially less than 1% of that time thinking about their career itself.</p>\n<p><em>Doing Good Better</em>\u00a0talks about so many things that I could never cover them all here, but hopefully I\u2019ve given you a taste. I highly recommend\u00a0it, and look forward to hearing your thoughts.</p></div></div>"},

My probabilistic estimate is that many here will agree that having a more rational response to the Paris attacks, and avoiding a rash military response, will raise QALYs (or WALYs to use <a href=\"/ea/pu/we_care_about_walys_not_qalys/\">Ben Todd's suggestion</a>). On a meta-level, adopting the strategies I suggest for more rational political engagement, by individuals and politicians alike, will substantially raise QALYs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yet it's really hard to measure the impact in QALYs. Here are some numbers to help do a <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/h5e/fermi_estimates/\">rough estimate</a>. It's published in the Sunday edition of The Plain Dealer\u200b, a major newspaper, <a href=\"http://www.theopedproject.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47:submission-information&amp;Itemid=65\">16th in the US</a>, with its Sunday edition distributed to over 424 thousand and the website having over 5 million visitors monthly. Currently, the article has over 240 comments, and a multitude of social media shares, indicating wide engagement. Since it's the Sunday edition, many people will read it throughout the week. So it has reached and will reach a wide number of people, it's about a breaking news event, the newspaper is in a major swing state and in a city that will host the Republican national convention. Hopefully some people will not only engage with the specific content, but with the broader ways of thinking about politics itself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What's your rough estimate of how valuable this is in terms of QALYs? To enumerate it more clearly, how much money would you have donated to have this article exist as opposed to not exist? More broadly, what kind of strategies would you suggest for enumerating the QALYs generated by this kind of article? Thanks for your thoughts, it will help me and Intentional Insights target our activities more precisely so that we can improve our positive impact on the world and contribute to human flourishing most optimally!</p></div></div>"},

{"date": "23rd Oct 2015", "title": "Evaluating Small, Effective Charities Vs. Large, Less Effective Charities", "author": "ScienceForSeekers", "num_comments": "4 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Hi EA'ers,</p>\n<p>I've got a question for you all about the best way to invest limited benefit-cost evaluation resources. \u00a0I wonder if folks have any thoughts about the relative value of evaluating small group of highly effective -- and typically small -- charities, versus spending additional resources to evaluate large charities which may not be as cost-effective..</p>\n<p>Ideally, everyone would give to the most effective charities, but the fact is that larger charities -- from United Way on down -- receive the bulk of giving dollars and have a disproportionate impact on how giving happens and how it's evaluated.</p>\n<p>EA tends to focus most of its evaluation resources on a few, targeted charities. \u00a0While this is obviously important, it also seems to me that we are missing some \"low-hanging fruit\" by not spending more evaluation resources on a wider range of charities. \u00a0Directing resources to more fully evaluate and improve the cost-effectiveness of large charities could have a larger \"meta\" benefit-cost ratio, in the sense of the value of an evaluation dollar in increasing the benefit-cost ratio of other dollars spent. \u00a0</p>\n<p>For example, the Salvation Army received $2 billion in donations last year. \u00a0Assuming that the money donated to it is roughly fixed, and not (unfortunately) very sensitive to rigorous measures of impact, then increasing its cost-effectiveness by only a small amount could have a greater net effect than further in-depth evaluations of smaller charities. \u00a0</p>\n<p>I've longed dreamed of a mega-database that would include detailed cost-effectiveness measures for lots of charities, as I think this would import the ideas of EA into a much greater pool of giving money and help it gain political strength. \u00a0Such a project would need some pretty intensive resources, however. \u00a0</p>\n<p>I'm interested in your thoughts!</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "13th Oct 2015", "title": "Making Effective Altruism more emotionally appealing", "author": "Gleb_T", "num_comments": "22 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>I'd like to open a discussion on making Effective Altruism more emotionally appealing. I'm especially interested in this topic due to my broader project, <a href=\"http://intentionalinsights.org/about\">Intentional Insights</a>, of spreading rational thinking, including about Effective Altruism, to a wide audience. As part of doing so, I find that I and other members of Intentional Insights engage with a number of people who are interested in EA when I present it to them, and accept the premise of doing the most good for the most number, but have trouble engaging with the movement due to the emotional challenges they experience. To be clear, this is in addition to some of the problematic signaling coming from the EA movement that <a href=\"/user/Tom_Davidson/\">Tom Davidson</a> described well in his recent piece, \"<a href=\"/ea/op/eas_image_problem/\">EA's Image Problem</a>,\" and not explicitly due to the things outlined there, although they play a role indirectly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What I am talking about is people who are interested in effective giving optimized to save the most lives, but then have trouble buying into the EA approach to it emotionally. They have challenges accepting that they have inherent cognitive biases that make their intuitions about optimal giving skewed. They have challenges letting go of cached patterns of giving to previous causes and accepting that their previous giving was suboptimal. They experience guilt over their previous giving or the lack thereof, something that causes them to flinch away from the EA movement. They have difficulty connecting emotionally with the data presented by venues like GiveWell as evidence for optimal giving, it doesn't feel emotionally rewarding to them. Moreover, they have emotional challenges with the difficulty of the many things they need to learn to \"get\" Effective Altruism - data analysis, utilitarian philosophy, rationality, etc. Many accept intellectually that an African life is worth the same inherently as an American life, but then have trouble emotionally enacting the implications of their intellectual recognition by optimizing their giving through contributions to alleviate African vs. American suffering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For instance, right now Intentional Insights is focusing on spreading rational thinking and effective altruism to the skeptic/secular movement. People I talk to who accept the premise of optimizing giving to do the most good try to rationalize their current giving to secular communities as optimal for saving lives by saying things like \"well, if I give to my secular community, it will create a venue where other secular people will feel safe and respected, and then we can give later to save the lives of Africans.\" Now, this is an awfully convenient way of justifying current giving, and I suspect it does not actually optimize for saving lives, but is just an example of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\">confirmation bias</a>. Sure, I present data from GiveWell on the benefits of giving to developing countries, but they still have an out that lets them preserve their self-image as rational people, since the QALYs of giving to a secular community and then potentially giving together latter are hard to quantify. Moreover, they often have trouble engaging with the dry data analysis, it just doesn't ring true to them emotionally.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This example illustrates some of the problems with accepting cognitive biases, letting go of cached patterns of giving, connecting emotionally with data, and enacting the implications of their emotional recognition, also known as the <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm\">drowning child problem</a>. Now, you might think the stances I described above are weird, and do not feel intuitive to you. I hear you, and my gut reaction also does not accept these stances. If I learn that something is true - i.e., if my goal is to give effectively to do the most good - then it is relatively easy for me to let go of cached patterns and update my beliefs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>However, I think I, and the brunt of EAs in general, are much more analytical in our thinking than the baseline. If we want to expand the EA movement, we can't fall into <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Typical_mind_fallacy\">typical mind fallacy</a> and assume that what worked to convince us will convince others who are less analytical and more emotionally-oriented thinkers. Too often, I have seen effective altruists try to convince others by waving data in their face, and then calling them intellectually dishonest and inconsistent thinkers when those others did not change their perspective due to their internal emotional resistance. We need to develop new ways of addressing this emotional resistance, in a compassionate and generous way, to grow the EA movement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something that I find worked with our outreach efforts is to help provide people interested in EA goals with emotional tools to address their internal emotional challenges. For instance, to address the guilt people experience over their previous giving, to address cached patterns, and help people update their beliefs, it helps to use the CBT tool of reframing by encouraging themselves to distance their current self from their past self, and remember that they did not have this information about EA when they decided on their previous giving, making it ok to choose a new path right now. Another approach I found helpful is to encourage people to think of themselves as being at the ordinary human baseline, and then orient toward improving, rather than seeing oneself as never able to achieve perfect rationality in one's giving. To address guilt in particular, teaching non-judgment and compassion toward oneself is really helpful. To help people connect emotionally with the hard data, we know what works to pull at people's heart strings - we should tell stories about the children saved from malaria, of the benefits people gained from GiveDirectly, etc. Indeed, I found that telling stories, and then supporting them with numbers and metrics, works well. Likewise, it helps to have effective altruists share personal and moving stories of why they got into effective altruism in the first place and why they are passionate about it, stories that illustrate their own strong feelings and go light on the data.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On an institutional level, I would suggest that EA groups focus more on being welcoming toward emotionally-oriented thinkers. Perhaps having people who are specifically assigned as mentors for new members, who can help be guides for their intellectual and emotional development alike.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What are your thoughts about these, and more broadly strategies for overcoming emotional resistance to Effective Altruism?

{"date": "9th Oct 2015", "title": "How does fighting diarrhoea stack up to malaria in effectiveness?", "author": "MichaelDello", "num_comments": "9 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>I saw an infographic about diarrhoea the other day that really caught my attention with some big statistics. It got me thinking that I had never really considered combating diarrhoea specifically as an avenue for improving global health. Typically I've focussed on Malaria, specifically through the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF). Below is a comparison between the impacts diarrhoea and malaria and the costs of combating them. The following figures for diarrhoea are taken from this infographic and compared where possible to figures from malaria (sources listed). The infographic didn\u2019t have a logo, producer or sources on it, and after research some of the figures don\u2019t seem to check out.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Diarrhoea is responsible for 1.5 million child deaths under 5 each year.</span></strong><span> (Note that according to (b) as of 2013 diarrhoea kills around 760,000 children under 5 per year, so this doesn\u2019t seem to check out)</span></p>\n<p><span>Malaria was responsible for 455,520 child deaths under 5 in 2013. (a)</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Wash programs have the potential to save over 2500 lives per day (175,000 per year). </span></strong><span>(I\u2019m always sceptical of the use of the word \u2018potential\u2019)</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>A safe water supply can reduce diarrhoea by 21%.\u00a0</span></strong><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>About half of the World's Hospital [sic] beds are occupied by patients with a water-related illness such as diarrhoea. </span></strong><span>(Not a proper source, but (h) repeats this figure)</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"Diarrhoea_kills_more_children_than_AIDS__measles_and_malaria_combined_\"><span>Diarrhoea kills more children than AIDS, measles and malaria combined.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong><span>Diarrhoea killed an estimated 1.26 million people in 2013 (e). In 2013, 1.5 million people died of HIV related illnesses (d), 145,700 people died from measles (c) and 584,000 people died from malaria (a), giving a total of 2.23 million deaths. This statement doesn\u2019t seem to check out, and by this time I\u2019m getting rather suspicious of the infographics\u2019 validity.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>In India alone, water-related diseases cost the economy 73 million working days per year.</span></strong><span> (Figure validated by (f))</span></p>\n<p><span>I can\u2019t find a recent figure for malaria to compare, but (g) has good related information.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>For every $1 invested in water, sanitisation and hygiene, $8 is returned in increased productivity. </span></strong><span>(I can\u2019t vet this, but (i) has good related information)</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>433 million school days are lost each year due to water-related diseases. </span></strong><span>(Not a proper source, but (h) repeats this figure)</span></p>\n<p><strong id=\"WHO_estimates_that_94__of_all_occurrences_of_diarrhoeal_diseases_are_completely_preventable_\"><span>WHO estimates that 94% of all occurrences of diarrhoeal diseases are completely preventable.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span><br></span></strong></p>\n<p><span>The latest figures suggest that AMF can save a life that would have been lost otherwise to malaria for ~$3,340 (j) by distributing bed nets to keep mosquitos away from people while they sleep.</span></p>\n<p><span>In The Life You Can Save, Peter Singer says \u201c</span><em><span>WHO, for example, estimates that many of the 3 million people who die annually from diarrhea or its complications can be saved by an extraordinarily simple recipe for oral rehydration therapy: a large pinch of salt and a fistful of sugar dissolved in a jug of clean water. This lifesaving remedy can be assembled for a few cents, if only people know about it. UNICEF estimates that the hundreds of thousands of children who still die of measles each year could be saved by a vaccine costing less than $1 a dose\u2026 while these low figures are undoubtedly an important part of the charities' efforts to attract donors, they are, unfortunately, not an accurate measure of the true cost of saving a life.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span>An article from The Guardian says \u201c</span></em><span>Right now Unicef is chlorinating water, making it safe to drink. At a cost of only 17p, it can provide the oral rehydration salts that will save a child from fatal diarrhoea.\u201d (k) But there is a gap between providing the rehydration salts and directly saving one life. The child consuming the salts may not have died anyway, or they might not use it.</span></p>\n<p><span>In Disease Control Priorities In Developing Countries (m; 2<sup>nd</sup> edition released 2006), it is stated that the cost of saving a life from diarrheal diseases is much more cost effective through educational intervention (~ US$500 \u201cand could be as low as US$14\u201d). \u201cScenarios with a high cost per life saved (more than US$6,000) are when prevalence rates are low or when implementation costs for quality-related interventions are high.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span>This would suggest that educational interventions targeting diarrheal diseases is more cost effective at saving lives than distributing bed nets. However, this is an older figure (pre-2006) and isn\u2019t backed up with the name of an organisation that can achieve this. It certainly highlights that diarrhoea may be worthy of more focus for reducing deaths due to widespread diseases than malaria. The last quotes also seem to suggest that perhaps an educational approach to combating malaria may be more effective than traditional approaches. This is rather typical of similar issues in developing countries.</span></p>\n<p><span>I haven\u2019t been able to find much research on water charities on the GiveWell website. A stub page exists, with the conclusion \u201c</span><span>In 2011, we identified 43 water charities and visited their websites to determine whether they published information online to answer the above question. By and large, we found limited information that answered our questions. We ultimately contacted six organizations and our reviews of 4 of them are still pending.\u201d It would seem that a renewed focus on water charities should be undertaken.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span><span><strong>The verdict</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>Some of the statements listed in the infographic don\u2019t appear to be entirely accurate, though the scale of the problem of diarrhoea is comparable to that of malaria. Initial findings reported here suggest that treating diarrhoea may be as or even more cost effective than combating diarrhoea. It is recommended that more research into the effectiveness of water charities be undertaken given the potential for high effectiveness, especially through educational programs regarding diarrhoea and related diseases.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Note: Many figures listed have an uncertainty range. A mean value is generally taken for simplicity.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span><span><br> </span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>References</strong></span></p>\n<p><span><strong><br></strong></span></p>\n<p><span> </span><span>(a) </span><a href=\"http://www.who.int/malaria/areas/high_risk_groups/children/en/\"><span><span>http://www.who.int/malaria/areas/high_risk_groups/children/en/</span></span></a></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>(b) </span><a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs330/en/\"><span><span>http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs330/en/</span></span></a></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span><span>(c) </span><cite><span><a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs286/en/\"><span>www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs286/en/</span></a></span></cite></span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><cite><span><span>(d) </span><a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/hiv/epidemic_status/deaths/en/\"><span><span>www.who.int/gho/hiv/epidemic_status/</span><span>deaths</span><span>/en/</span></span></a></span></cite></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>(e) </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4340604/\"><span><span>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4340604/</span></span></a></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span><span>(f) </span><cite><span><a href=\"http://www.wateraid.org/~/media/.../drinking-water-quality-rural-india.pdf\"><span>www.wateraid.org/~/media/.../drinking-water-quality-rural-</span><span>india</span><span>.pdf</span></a></span></cite></span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><cite><span><span>(g) </span><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1720/\"><span><span>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1720/</span></span></a></span></cite></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><cite><span><span>(h) </span><a href=\"http://thewaterproject.org/health\"><span><span>http://thewaterproject.org/health</span></span></a></span></cite></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><cite><span><span>(i) </span><a href=\"http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/wsh0404summary/en/\"><span><span>http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/wsh0404summary/en/</span></span></a></span></cite></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><cite><span><span>(j) </span><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF\"><span><span>http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF</span></span></a></span></cite></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><cite><span><span>(k) </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/mar/05/mozambique.theobserver\"><span><span>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/mar/05/mozambique.theobserver</span></span></a></span></cite></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><cite><span><span>(l) </span><a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/5e/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/\"><span><span>http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/5e/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/</span></span></a></span></cite></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><cite><span><span>(m) </span><a href=\"https://books.google.com.au/books?isbn=0821361805\"><span><span>https://books.google.com.au/books?isbn=0821361805</span></span></a><span> </span></span></cite></p>\n<p><span> </span></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "3rd Sep 2015", "title": "The Redundancy of Quantity", "author": "Denis Drescher", "num_comments": "3 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>I\u2019m advocating for a simpler way to think about donations and investments, namely, not to distinguish\u00a0them. (<a href=\"http://claviger.net/the-redundancy-of-quantity.html\">Cross-posted from my blog.</a>)</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://claviger.net/images/donations-and-efficiency.png\" alt=\"donations-and-efficiency.png\"></p>\n<p>Inspired by the two-part nature of the term \u201ceffective altruism,\u201d I often see the goal of the movement explained as pictured above. We want to increase the amounts that are donated and increase the efficiency of the donations to maximize the integral, the effect.<sup><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup> The graph is pilfered from Giving What We Can, and since they are centrally concerned with encouraging donations and use them as proxy for their impact, it makes sense for them to think in these terms. But I think this is not the most parsimonious model, and the alternative has advantages beyond\u00a0elegance.</p>\n<p>The alternative is to think only in terms of efficiency. Just as the beneficiaries of our donation, we\u2019re also capable of producing and, significantly, leveraging utils, so rather than thinking in terms of <span>ROI</span> in one case and in terms of utils (or QALYs) in the other, we can just think in terms of utils in both cases. (Or whatever you\u2019re optimizing for rather than\u00a0utils.)</p>\n<p>Effective altruists have long compared donations to investments or even already seen donations as another type of investment, so this may seem trivial to some, but making more consistent use of this perspective and using it to encourage altruists to donate efficiently has several\u00a0advantages.</p>\n<p>Below a few advantages and disadvantages I can think of. Do you have further ideas?</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_Advantages\">The\u00a0Advantages</h2>\n<h3 id=\"It_is_Inclusive\">It is\u00a0Inclusive</h3>\n<p>Someone who is poor \u2013 certainly when they\u2019re third-world poor, but it\u2019s a sliding scale, logarithmic I think \u2013 has an extremely much harder time investing time or money into others\u2019 happiness than someone who is even modestly affluent. Not being able to have the same impact by donating, these people will feel like failures compared to many high-profile high-achievers in the movement. Yet they may be just as smart and compassionate, and just lost the birth\u00a0lottery.</p>\n<p>But the poorer they are the more they have the ability to cost-effectively improve their own happiness. I\u2019ve read an article a while ago (which I can\u2019t find anymore) about people in great poverty who have devised sophisticated ways of managing their debt while maintaining liquidity. Their methods may be highly cost-effective at improving total happiness at their small scale, even if they\u2019re only leveraging their own or that of their family. If ultimately they would be altruists given the means, they should feel welcomed in the\u00a0movement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"It_is_Motivating\">It is\u00a0Motivating</h3>\n<p>Friends of mine, and I too, often struggle with giving later. We are students, earn little, and know that it is best for us to invest in our education and careers first to earn as much as possible as early as possible, and then have for donating the maximum of money over the maximum of time. This phase feels preparatory and makes us impatient. But that is only because we think of donations as something qualitatively different from the other investments that we\u2019re already\u00a0making.</p>\n<p>Once we come to the point where our System 1s accept investments in our education as just another vehicle to achieving our altruistic moral goals, we\u2019re having an impact right now. The reduction in suffering that we effect may be deferred, but even with <span>AMF</span> our investments are converted into actual bed nets with a delay, so any difference is only\u00a0quantitative.</p>\n<h3 id=\"It_Expands_the_Circle\">It Expands the\u00a0Circle</h3>\n<p>People who have a strong separation between themselves and others encoded in their moral goals (rather than just as a habit they want to break) will find it intuitive to make a distinction between investments that increase their happiness and those that increase the happiness of others. The rest of us, however, may come to understand <span>EA</span> reasoning much more easily the better we understand how this separation (which we don\u2019t actually find morally relevant) influences our\u00a0thinking.</p>\n<p>Just as not thinking in terms of this separation may decrease risk aversity in altruism and expand the moral circle, so making this distinction may have the counterproductive effect of reinforcing this\u00a0separation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"It_Reduces_Inferential_Distance\">It Reduces Inferential\u00a0Distance</h3>\n<p>Or it reduces something like inferential distance but between parts of our own model of the world rather than those of different\u00a0people.</p>\n<p>We are all fairly adroit at thinking about cost-effectiveness when it comes to everyday investments, so people new to effective altruism can readily transfer that experience to our new type of investment. Some of us have particular knowledge of finance and can probably recognize patterns more easily that will enable more effective altruist financial\u00a0innovations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"It_Encourages_Counterfactual_Reasoning\">It Encourages Counterfactual\u00a0Reasoning</h3>\n<p>The flip side of this is that it makes budgeting hard, as described below, but the positive side is that it encourages people to think more clearly about the relative quality of their investments. 6% p.a. in returns doesn\u2019t seem so amazing anymore when you can get <a href=\"http://www.harbus.org/2015/you-could-be-the-warren-buffett-of-social-investing/\">6000% within \u201ca few years.\u201d</a> When you need to trade off donating now vs. donating later, you have to think in terms of the same outcomes\u00a0anyway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_Disadvantages\">The\u00a0Disadvantages</h2>\n<h3 id=\"The_Magic_of__Donation_\">The Magic of\u00a0\u201cDonation\u201d</h3>\n<p>Just as the separation between donations and other investments can be harmful, it can also be used for good.\u00a0Compare:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>EA</span>: \u201cPlease buy one of our buttons. They\u2019re \u20ac5, and all proceeeds go to <span>AMF</span>.\u201d<br> Donor: \u201c\u20ac5 for a cheap button like that? No offence, I know it\u2019s for charity, but that\u2019s a total rip-off. I had some made last year, and they were only \u20ac.60 in\u00a0production!\u201d</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>EA</span>: \u201cPlease donate to our charity, <span>AMF</span>. For a donation of \u20ac5 or more, you can get button as a token of our gratitude. It can always remind you of the value of good deeds.\u201d<br> Donor: \u201cAwesome! Here, have\u00a0\u20ac10!\u201d</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The proper and sustainable solution would be to present the Child in the Pond analogy to them, show them effective altruism, and then have them donate because they want to save people from malaria, but that will only work for a small fraction of your clients, and if you have several people per minute coming to your <span>EA</span> booth, you won\u2019t have the time to even try. Rather you can hope that they\u2019ll later reflect \u201cWow, I donated \u20ac10 for a cheap (but pretty!) button, I must be an altruist. Or I like that charity a lot. Let\u2019s have a look at what they\u2019re writing on their\u00a0blog.\u201d</p>\n<p>But in this case I would blame the medium rather than the message since this ad-hoc manner of soliciting investments is highly exploitable\u00a0anyway.</p>\n<h3 id=\"It_Makes_Budgeting_Hard\">It Makes Budgeting\u00a0Hard</h3>\n<p>One central <a href=\"http://claviger.net/dissociation-for-altruists.html\"><span>EA</span> coping strategy</a> is to have a separate donation budget and worry about the counterfactual use of the rest of your money only once a year. Without the categorical separation of donations, we\u2019ll have to think of some other manner of\u00a0budgeting.</p>\n<p>One solution may be different classes of risk-aversity. One low-risk class may be dedicated to GiveWell- or <span>ACE</span>-recommended charities, another to metacharities or endeavors as Open Phil might evaluate, and another high-risk class to yourself, an intervention as 80,000 Hours might\u00a0evaluate.</p>\n<p>You can think of the same classes also in terms of how long-term the investments are, what their volatility is, or what the resulting util liquidity is. I\u2019ll stick to two such budgets, but maybe there are advantages to introducing finer\u00a0graduations.</p>\n<div>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>I prefer to think of \u201ceffective\u201d as meaning that we focus on the effect rather than that we achieve it by means of high cost-effectiveness, since it should then rather be called \u201cefficient altruism.\u201d\u00a0<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\" href=\"#fnref:1\">\u21a9</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol></div></div></div>"},

Many criticisms of effective altruism (even the excellent ones in this\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://bostonreview.net/forum/logic-effective-altruism/peter-singer-reply-effective-altruism-responses\">Boston Review forum</a><span>) go like this:</span></div>\n<div><span><br></span></div>\n<div><span>1) X is important (or Y is unimportant).</span></div>\n<div><span>2) Effective altruism ignores X (or gives undue weight to Y).</span></div>\n<div><span>3) Therefore, effective altruism is flawed.</span></div>\n<div><span><br></span></div>\n<div><span>If the goal is to criticize the fundamental idea of EA, then I think these criticisms miss the mark. If (1) is really true, then all that implies is that EA should focus on X. If the goal is to criticize the EA community, then these criticisms are more on point, though there's a question of whether a community is defined by what its members do or by the fundamental ideas that unite them.</span></div>\n<div><span><br></span></div>\n<div><span>But similar points have been made by others, so I'd like to focus on two reasons why the framing of these criticisms matters.</span></div>\n<div><span><br></span></div>\n<div><span>1) If they consciously adopted the role of internal critics to EA, those in favor of institutional reform, for instance, could be part of a serious debate within EA over whether focusing on policy advocacy is effective. This would not just be a more precise statement of the criticisms - it could improve EA more than an external criticism. More importantly, it could fill\u00a0<a href=\"https://chrisblattman.com/2015/07/20/the-problem-with-evidence-based-policy-change-is-we-dont-have-evidence-on-the-important-policies/\">a gap in research on the effectiveness of policy advocacy</a>, something that would be edifying not just for EAs but for anyone who cares about evidence.</span></div>\n<div><span><br></span></div>\n<div><span>2) Framing the debate in this way could lead those who favor a systemic approach to realize their significant ability to impact the world. People who call for focusing on institutions often, it seems, take it as an excuse not to do much to address global problems. If it turns out that we can do more by focusing more directly on institutions than we can by donating to charity, this should call for those who care about policy to follow the EA movement in making a serious personal commitment to change the world.</span></div></div></div>"},

Moral economics is particularly concerned with concepts that are useful for an aggregative consequentialist system of value, and forms of trade between agents that value actions according to these systems. Effective altruists are frequently good examples of such agents.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Why\">Why</h2>\n<p>The structure of moral reasoning has thus far been mostly the domain of philosophers, whereas economic reasoning has been the domain of economists and behavioral economists. Traditional economics has become a well developed academic discipline, with hundreds of specific concepts that help economic agents navigate the world. By contrast, in the domain of morality and economics we are in the beginnings of a barter-like system, with some tentative ideas such as certificates of impact starting to take momentum, and <a href=\"http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/papers/moral-trade.pdf\">a single unpublished paper</a> explaining moral trade in the philosophical literature.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When we look at the intersection of Moral Agency and Economics as its own discipline, Moral Economics, we create the possibility of transferring knowledge from the domain of economics to this new sub-branch much faster. To do so, we examine concepts that are important in economics, find analogous concepts and how they diverge in Moral Economics, and allow them to surface by writing about them. Moral economics is the range of a function that maps the structures we know from traditional economics, taking the moral exchange realm as input. The end result is a new way of reasoning about Moral Exchange that can facilitate the creation of moral markets, which facilitate the funneling of resources from the traditional economic realm to a realm that is value aligned with the interests of moral agents.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Whom\">Whom</h2>\n<p>Moral Economics can be of use to:\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Moral Agents </strong>who would like to trade with other moral agents with similar preferences and distinct opportunities, or dissimilar preferences.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Economists and Academics</strong>\u00a0who are interested in further developing the similarities and differences in concepts, ideas, equations etc... when they refer to traditional economics and when they refer to altruistically oriented agents.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Founders and Developers</strong>\u00a0who are developing phone or desktop apps to facilitate trade among altruistically oriented agents, or who are developing stock markets and similar applications with moral currencies.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Effective Altruists: </strong>if we map the development of ideas related to moral economics so far, the majority of ideas have come from and is of interest to effective altruists.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"How\">How</h2>\n<p>To use the idea of Moral Economics fruitfully you can:\u00a0</p>\n<p>1) Conceive of an economic structure that operates differently for altruists and write about it here in the EA forum.\u00a0</p>\n<p>2) Seize an economic opportunity determined by a niche of trade that is currently occupied in Traditional Economics but hasn't emerged in the moral realm yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>3) Further develop one of the concepts in the preliminary list of economics concepts that map in interesting and different ways for altruistic exchange that\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/l9/moving_moral_economics_forward/\">I laid out here.</a>\u00a0</p>\n<p>4) Enter<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/moraleconomics\"> the googlegroups</a> for moral economics and help others who are developing writings and ideas within the field, and help them edit their writings for the EA forum and other venues.\u00a0</p>\n<p>5) Reach out to economists and financially savvy people so they join the creation of this domain of knowledge.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"When\">When</h2>\n<p>Developing a better understanding of the opportunities that lie in the moral economic realm now is valuable for the same reason that globalization was valuable for the Asian tigers when they had their fast economic rise. It is cheaper, faster and more effective to copy an already existing technology than to create a new one from scratch. The field of knowledge known as economics is a well known and established mental technology for reasoning about interacting agents with values and the ability to trade. Moral economics is still in an economy of Barter. The faster we import from traditional economics, the faster the moral realm will grow as a fraction of use of resources. The opportunity window has just opened, and each individual has high counterfactual value right now. Once we have a better map of what can or cannot be done in the moral realm, and how to do get it done, this will no longer be the case. That, however, is years away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Though the original concepts which I'm suggesting are <a href=\"/ea/l1/moral_economics_concepts/\">paradigmatic examples of Moral Economic</a>s which came from Toby Ord, Rob Wiblin, Ben Kuhn, Paul Christiano and many others, so far most of the momentum for Moral Economics has come from me and Giles Edkins - whose posts will soon appear here - and my intention is to continue endorsing the development of this sub-field for as long as needed for it to move on without my input, so we really need more people writing here and helping this build momentum.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"What_for_\">What for?</h2>\n<p>There are several market inefficiencies that can and will become more fluid as the moral market develops. Just as the Asian tigers had economic incentives to copy western technology in order to faster reach economic prowess, moral agents too have an economic incentive to achieve a larger moral economic capacity. We just have to gaze into the right direction and find the hidden niches of value. Our attempts are suggesting a direction for where to look; you are the one who will have to gaze at it.\u00a0</p></div></div>"},

Differentiating an estimate of happiness as a function of income lets you estimate the happiness created by increasing marginal consumption. If you assume happiness is logarithmic in income, then the dollar amount at which you're indifferent between saving a life and increasing total consumption that much increases as income * log(income).

People are happier when they have higher consumption. If I could save the life of one American, but reduce American GDP by 10%, I\u2019m pretty sure that would overall not be a good trade.</p>\n<p>So we need to have a way of comparing the damage done by reducing the consumption of an economy by some amount of money to the damage done by someone in the economy dying.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Logarithmic_happiness\">Logarithmic happiness</h2>\n<p>It\u2019s pretty common to approximate happiness as linear in the logarithm of income, which I\u2019m going to equivocate with consumption for the rest of this post.

However, it seems plausible to me that our log model breaks down when people are incredibly poor. So I think we should use two different strategies to think about\u00a0<span><span><span><span><span><span>k</span></span></span></span></span><span>k</span></span>.\u00a0<strong>Firstly</strong>, we should think about it assuming the model is correct, looking for the level of consumption at which life seems to not be worth living.\u00a0<strong>Secondly</strong>, we should try ignoring its literal meaning and just trying to directly estimate it by looking at happiness variation across relatively small consumption variations. This should hopefully provide a good estimate over the kind of range we\u2019re interested in.</p>\n<p>Imagine we decided that living on $100,000 a year is twice as much fun as living on $10,000 a year. This would mean that\u00a0<span><span><span><span><span><span>l</span><span>o</span><span>g</span><span>100000</span><span>+</span><span>k</span></span></span></span></span><span>log100000+k</span></span>\u00a0is twice as much as\u00a0<span><span><span><span><span><span>l</span><span>o</span><span>g</span><span>10000</span><span>+</span><span>k</span></span></span></span></span><span>log10000+k</span></span>. So\u00a0<span><span><span><span><span><span>k</span></span></span></span></span><span>k</span></span>\u00a0would be -3. If we thought poverty was not as bad as that, then maybe we\u2019d be saying that living on $1,000 a year is half as good as $10,000. In that case,\u00a0<span><span><span><span><span><span>k</span></span></span></span></span><span>k</span></span>\u00a0would be -2. I think that the first of those is probably truer, so this is another argument for estimating\u00a0<span><span><span><span><span><span>k</span></span></span></span></span><span>k</span></span>\u00a0as about -3.</p>\n<p>Maybe we should be concerned by this, because more than a billion humans have less than $1000 annual consumption. I have a few thoughts on this. To start with, it seems plausible that the purchasing power parity adjustment I\u2019m using isn\u2019t powerful enough. It\u2019s cheap to have a place to sleep in rural Malawi, much more than it is in America. If there were a Malawian rural town within commuting distance of my office in SoMa, I\u2019d be ecstatic to pay $200 a month to live in a thatch-roofed hut there. (I\u2019m not kidding: I lived on an air mattress on the floor of my office for six months last year.) There are lots of really cheap goods available to Malawians, like thatched roof huts and really cheap shitty rice, which are unavailable to me but make it much more easy to live cheaply.</p>\n<p>To some extent, I\u2019m willing to buy that living in SF counts as bonus consumption, because I\u2019m closer to fun things, but mostly I just live here so that I can work here, which feels more like an employment-related expenditure than consumption to me. So maybe I don\u2019t buy that as someone with an annual consumption of $30k, I\u2019m really getting 40 times the consumption in my life as the average resident of Malawi.</p>\n<p>The book\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/vwtxhtjokdokvcx/Poor-Economics.pdf?dl=0\">Poor Economics</a>\u00a0tells the story (starting on page 20) of this extremely poor Indonesian guy called Pak Solhin. He used to live on $2 USD PPP a day, until he lost his job, after which he lived like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pak Solhin himself survived on about 9 pounds of subsidized rice he got every week from the government and on fish that he caught from the edge of a lake (he could not swim). His brother fed him once in a while. In the week before we last spoke with him, he had had two meals a day for four days, and just one for the other three.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That life is being classified as significantly less than $2 PPP a day, which I don\u2019t think includes the benefits of free rice, his brother\u2019s food, or fishing in the river.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not trying to trivialize extreme poverty here: that life sounds pretty unpleasant, and I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have it. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s entirely sensible to call that \u201cliving on $1 a day\u201d.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I get the benefits of a lot of government spending which Malawians don\u2019t: I have subsidized public transport, and reasonably good police, and good roads, and so on.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s another fact about consumption levels and happiness. Under most natural circumstances, if you consume extremely small amounts (like $1 a year), then you aren\u2019t extremely sad, you just die from hunger or exposure. In fact, the consumption levels at which my happiness function predicts your life isn\u2019t worth living is actually pretty close to where I\u2019d imagine that you\u2019d die from hunger if we were really adjusting for PPP correctly. This is either incredibly interesting or a surprising coincidence. I am interested in hearing speculation about this.</p>\n<p>The variability of consumption also plays into this. If it costs you a dollar a day to not die of hunger, then if your monthly consumption has a standard deviation of 50c per day, I suspect you\u2019d die in a few months. So even if the lowest survivable level of poverty is bad enough that your life is barely worth living, perhaps not many people will live at that level of poverty for long.</p>\n<p>Marie La points out that another way of estimating this would be to look at the mortal risks people take when they are starving. We could look at situations where people had a choice between remaining in a place suffering from famine, or doing something extremely dangerous to escape. She points out the example of post-war Vietnam, where the South Vietnamese who tried to escape faced about a 50% chance of death and tried to escape anyway, partially because they were so enormously hungry. One particularly good way of estimating this would be to look at neighboring regions where escaping is roughly as risky but the levels of famine were different, and comparing the rates at which people tried to escape. There would obviously be a million confounders here, like how unpleasant the regime was or how much people expected the situation to improve, but we might get some useful data regardless.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s all been trying to estimate\u00a0<span><span><span><span><span><span>k</span></span></span></span></span><span>k</span></span>\u00a0by looking at happiness at the lowest end: how about if we try to estimate it by looking at how much a 10% change in consumption changes happiness in a nation? This has fewer philosophical issues, so I\u2019m not going to discuss them. This way of indirectly estimating\u00a0<span><span><span><span><span><span>k</span></span></span></span></span><span>k</span></span>\u00a0is closer to how we\u2019re going to estimate it in the next section.</p>\n<p>You also might be interested in looking up the paper which had happiness as a function of consumption\u00a0<em>within</em>\u00a0particular poor countries, then trying to solve for\u00a0<span><span><span><span><span><span>k</span></span></span></span></span><span>k</span></span>\u00a0within that much smaller and easier to measure range. However, this requires making a judgement call about how to translate the descriptions of happiness into real numbers. Depending on your feelings, this judgement call might be worse or better than what I did.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Numerically_estimating_kk\">Numerically estimating\u00a0<span><span><span><span><span><span>k</span></span></span></span></span><span>k</span></span></h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s a few data points to use to estimate\u00a0<span><span><span><span><span><span>k</span></span></span></span></span><span>k</span></span>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A few weeks ago I was talking to this dude who grew up in poverty in Mexico and illegally immigrated to America when he was 12. We chatted about his previous quality of life for a while: not getting enough food, only getting one pair of shoes a year, and so on. My impression is that his life in Mexico seemed about half as worth living as his life here is. From his description of his quality of life, and my understanding of Mexican poverty, I would guess he was living on maybe $4000 a year. I wish that I\u2019d thought to ask him for a numeric statement of how much better his life here was, but I didn\u2019t think of this. Next time.</li>\n<li>Slate Star Codex\u00a0<a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/30/utility-weight-results/\">did a survey</a>\u00a0trying to calculate the relative quality of life in different situations. Respondents thought that Ethiopian life is 50% as good as American life, and Chinese life was 85% as good.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I\u2019m a lot more averse to poverty than SSC readers, apparently.</p>\n<p>From these\u00a0<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ofwjlxGFlgG7cVnuySiga8yApl6AWLDlyZPa-c5ZHRc/edit?usp=sharing\">we get an average estimate</a>\u00a0of\u00a0<span><span><span><span><span><span>k</span></span></span></span></span><span>k</span></span>\u00a0as about -2.2. This number is low enough that nations with average consumption PPP less than\u00a0<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>10</span></span><span><span><span><span>2.2</span></span></span></span></span></span><span>=</span><span>158</span></span></span></span></span><span>102.2=158</span></span>\u00a0are classified to have a negative quality of life. <span>I think this is an inaccurately high bar</span>. I removed the China data point because I think that the people answering the Slate Star Codex survey overestimated how rich China is. I vaguely recall the survey implying that you lived in a city in China or something, as opposed to living in rural China as 50% of Chinese actually do.</p>\n<p>Overall, I think that this model of happiness as logarithmic in consumption is good but gives bad results for extremely poor countries, because we are underestimating the consumption of extremely poor people.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Application_to_global_poverty_charities\">Application to global poverty charities</h2>\n<p>One interpretation of these numbers is \u201cthe price at which we are indifferent to decreasing total consumption by that much to save a single life\u201d. Another interpretation, though, is \u201cthe price at which saving a single life is better value for money than just increasing consumption by that much\u201d. This is really important, because as philanthropists we have the option of doing both of these things, most obviously through GiveDirectly and AMF. Let\u2019s quickly review the levels of poverty of the people affected by these programs:</p>\n<p>AMF operates mostly in Malawi and the DRC. Bednet distribution is slightly cheaper in Malawi. Malawi has a GDP PPP per capita of about $226. Apparently, this is\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.osisa.org/sites/default/files/sup_files/chapter_2_-_malawi.pdf\">pretty unevenly distributed</a>. So the people saved by AMF, who I think mostly live in rural areas (from looking up regions listed\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/Distributions.aspx\">here</a>), are probably poorer than average for Malawians. (AMF\u2019s distributors seem to find that\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/AMF/Netcheu-PreDistributionRegistrationSurvey-Data-Rcvd24Dec11-names%20withheld.xls\">most of the houses they look at need LLINs</a>\u00a0(Excel file), so we don\u2019t need to worry about saving unusually poor people among rural Malawians.)</p>\n<p>Kenyans who receive GiveDirectly grants have a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly#footnoteref85_siu35s3\">median nominal consumption of $0.55 per day</a>. (I use median instead of mean because I suspect that consumption fits a log-normal distribution; this is suggested by the mean being higher than the median.) The nominal-to-PPP conversion for Kenya seems to be about 2.18 (from comparing nominal and PPP GDP estimates), so that\u2019s yearly consumption of about $408. This is almost twice Malawi\u2019s mean consumption, and as I said above the Malawians saved by AMF are probably poorer than above. Obviously, these numbers are so bad that they\u2019re almost useless. The Malawian consumption estimates\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.osisa.org/sites/default/files/sup_files/chapter_2_-_malawi.pdf\">here</a>\u00a0try to include sustenance farming, but it\u2019s really hard to get that right. According to the table on page 24 of\u00a0<a href=\"http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/newsroom/wfp274603.pdf\">this report</a>, Malawi\u2019s proportion of undernourished people is 23.1% while Kenya\u2019s is 30.4%. (Undernourished means that you are below the \u201cminimum level of dietary energy consumption\u201d.) These numbers kinda look like they fit with my hypothesis that GiveDirectly recipients have pretty similar levels of consumption to Malawians saved through AMF.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve got a plethora of extra factors in this particular case. To start with, maybe there are flow-through effects of cash transfers which case them to increase consumption more. Also, bednets have other positive effects than saving lives, like preventing developmental impairments from malaria that limit lifetime earning potential, preventing malaria death in the above-5 year old age group (which isn\u2019t counted) and prevention of other mosquito-borne illnesses. And having a marginal human might increase the consumption of other people in their society in some situations, but I don\u2019t know which situations that is. Also, GiveDirectly might save lives as well, by giving people money to buy things like medicine and medical care and better food, or indirectly by allowing people to get e.g. metal roofs and thus having better hygiene in their houses.</p>\n<p>I think that my formula is totally useless for answering the question of how much we should be willing to spend per life saved by AMF if our alternative is giving to GiveDirectly, because it\u2019s so sensitive to changes in my\u00a0<span><span><span><span><span><span>k</span></span></span></span></span><span>k</span></span>. However, I did get some feeling about it from doing the research into poverty in Malawi and Kenya I did to write this discussion section. The people whose lives you save by giving to AMF seem to be pretty intensely impoverished. If 30% of Malawians are undernourished in general, and people saved by AMF are unusually poor, I suspect that probably a majority of the lives saved there are undernourished. That means that these people feel hungry\u00a0<em>all the time</em>. I some sympathy for the perspective that those lives sound perhaps not worth living, in which case making them better is the better option. I also think it\u2019s pretty plausible that these lives are actually pretty okay. At the moment, I am probably inclined to think that the lives of the extremely poor are worth living.</p>\n<p>GiveWell has obviously thought about how to compare saving lives to increasing consumption, but AFAICT they haven\u2019t considered it this explicitly. In 2012 they said that they suspected AMF was a\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/12/19/cost-effectiveness-of-nets-vs-deworming-vs-cash-transfers/\">much better deal</a>\u00a0than GiveDirectly. However, GiveWell hasn\u2019t tried to quantify the value of increasing consumption vs saving lives like I have here. They probably haven\u2019t tried because it turns out that when you do, you get relatively difficult-to-interpret results, as I did above.</p>\n<p>Carl Shulman has also written about\u00a0<a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2014/03/givedirectly-happiness-and-log-income.html?m=1\">happiness as log of consumption and GiveDirectly</a>\u00a0before\u2013I hadn\u2019t seen his post before I wrote all this.</p>\n<p>Peter Hurford has a great summary of the lives of extremely poor people in third world countries\u00a0<a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-do-the-extremely-poor-live/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>If I donated to global poverty causes, I really don\u2019t know which of these I\u2019d give to.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The value of saving a life increases linearithmicly with consumption. This is neat. I am pretty sure this is correct, and I\u2019m really happy to have a principled derivation for it.</p>\n<p>I think my equation for the value of saving a life is quite good for richer countries where it\u2019s easier to measure consumption.

However, later I learned of an external library which supported a different approach that was     superior and easier to implement.</p>\n<p>I had considered this library earlier but dismissed it, having not spent enough time to get to know it. Once I implemented this library, I was able to     re-create the needed architecture in only four days. What took two months of my time could have been done in two weeks if I spent a bit more time     researching beforehand. (Another reason not to count \u201chours worked\u201d.)</p>\n<p>The other biggest problem I had was mismanaging a data retrieval project by misunderstanding how high priority the project was and by not asking for help     when I needed it. I learned that it\u2019s important to ask clarifying questions and understand the priority and process behind projects before doing them.     Luckily, for what I\u2019ve been led to believe are unrelated reasons, I\u2019m no longer in charge of any data retrieval projects.</p>\n<p>I think these mistakes happen, and if I wasn\u2019t making these mistakes, recognizing them, and learning from them, I don\u2019t think I would be able to say in     good confidence that I was improving as a programmer and as a corporate worker. So I\u2019m not disappointed. But I hope not to repeat these mistakes on my     future projects.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Q2_Goal\"> Q2 Goal</strong></p>\n<p>I made a mistake last quarter in not making sufficiently good goals that would survive three months of change, so this time I\u2019d like to make my goal a     little bit more general: Reflect on how I can be a better programmer. My ideal deliverable for this goal would be three things: (a) an blog post     overviewing of what I\u2019ve learned programming to date, (b) a blog post with thoughts on how programmers can become better, and (c) a reflection in my Q2     review on how I\u2019ve improved as a programmer.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2 id=\"Secret_Entrepreneurship_Projects\">Secret Entrepreneurship Projects</h2>\n<p>In September 2014, I spent five hours launching <a href=\"http://64or32.com/\">64or32.com</a>, a dinky advertising-supported application to    <a href=\"http://64or32.com/\">tell people whether they have 32-bit or 64-bit browsers</a>. It\u2019s earned about $50 since it\u2019s initial launch, but has slowed     down to earning ~$0.10 a month, which I take it means the dream is over.</p>\n<p>Since Sep 2014, I have been working with two friends, fiddling around with several different project ideas, even getting two of them close to a possible     launch. But ultimately we put both of those two on hold to pursue another idea, and then put that idea on hold to pursue yet another idea.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot we can safely say. I can say that one of the two projects is open sourced (i.e., free) modeling software. The     other one of the two is not one that I can talk about publicly out on the open internet yet. I do err on the side of transparency, and I do hope to be able     to talk about both projects more freely by the end of Q2.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Q1_Goals\"> Q1 Goals</strong></p>\n<p><strong> Launch something. [Outcome: Did not happen.]</strong> By the end of 2014, we had two projects that both were only a few weeks away from a potential launch. However,     we think that those two projects are not as high-value as the projects we\u2019re working on now. However, one of the two projects (the open source one) I hope     to have launched by the end of Q2. The other project will take longer to launch.</p>\n<p><strong> Move monthly revenue from $6/mo to $12/mo. [Outcome: Success] </strong>Surprisingly, this did actually happen, though not in the way I expected. We\u2019ve successfully     moved monthly revenue from a one-digit figure to a two-digit figure!</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Wrong1\"> What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>Entrepreneurship is really messy and there is a very large gap between practice and theory, especially when the theory is really just anecdotes about other     people\u2019s practice.</p>\n<p>The hardest thing has been a lack of planning, with too many ideas that seem good and not enough execution. This led us to move between idea to idea,     getting a few ideas close, but not doing the final push to launch any of them.</p>\n<p>While I guess it\u2019s good no one can accuse us of a \u201csunk cost fallacy\u201d, this seems generally like a bad habit to be in, and I\u2019m nervous that we\u2019re making a     mistake by not following through. Frequently in developing our potential products we enjoy the coding and solving hard problems, but then turn away from     the \u201cboring\u201d development side of things, like writing documentation, talking to potential users, etc.</p>\n<p>This ties in somewhat with our other problem -- while I\u2019ve personally read countless articles and books about taking a \u201cminimum viable product\u201d approach, I     tend to forget to actually do this in any of the actual work. We keep adding cool features because they\u2019re fun and we\u2019re sure they\u2019ll be useful, without     just getting the project out there first and asking potential users.</p>\n<p>Also, there have been times when I\u2019ve been a bit too excited about these ideas without potentially thinking them through. This has led me to scare a few     people with notions of quitting my job when, upon further reflection, I don\u2019t really have any basis (or desire) to do that yet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Right1\"> What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p>I put \u201cWhat Went Wrong\u201d before \u201cWhat Went Right\u201d because I\u2019m really tempted for this section to say \u201cNothing\u201d. But that\u2019s clearly not the case. Overall,     I\u2019ve been impressed with our team and our ability to make significant progress quarter-to-quarter while still all having full-time jobs and other     priorities.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Q2_Goals\"> Q2 Goals</strong></p>\n<p><strong> Launch the modeling software project as an invite beta ASAP.</strong> We really have to get this in front of potential users and reflect on their feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>Launch the modeling software project as an open beta before the end of Q2.</strong> This is a bit of a stretch goal, but we think we can make it.</p>\n<p><strong>See whether the other project is actually launchable.</strong> This mostly involves legal due diligence. While we might not get a clear \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer, I\u2019d     like to be a lot more confident with it than I am now.</p>\n<p><strong>Move total revenue to &gt;$1K.</strong> Our current total revenue stands at ~$250 and I have some good reasons to expect some growth. I think total revenue is     potentially a better figure for my purposes than monthly revenue, since things are still fluctuating a lot. But let\u2019s see what we can bring in over Q2.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Charity_Science\">Charity Science</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/\">Charity Science</a> is a non-profit that aims to popularize the dense materials of <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org\">GiveWell</a> for general audiences.

The biggest thing I did in Q1 for     them was host both Joey and Xio here in Chicago. We had a good time as a mini-vacation, but we also arranged two speaking opportunities -- one where all three of us were on a panel at <a href=\"http://chi-fi.org/\">Chi-Fi</a> and Joey spoke at the    <a href=\"http://chicago.sundayassembly.com\">Chicago Sunday Assembly</a>. In both cases the audience was small (~9 people and ~22 people respectively), but     in both cases the talks were well-received.</p>\n<p>(Also, I must admit that really it was Marcus Davis who did all the arranging for the two talks and all I had to do was figure out how to get Joey and Xio     there.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"What_Went_Wrong\">What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>I considered \u201cramping up my involvement\u201d in Charity Science for Q1, but attempting to do so failed and ended up creating some burnout. As anyone can see     from scrolling through this list, I\u2019m attempting to do too much, and I really need to cut back. I personally feel less irreplacable at Charity Science than     on my other projects, so it\u2019s probably for the best that I just remain where I am as a board member, advisor, and donor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Q2_Goal1\"> Q2 Goal</strong></p>\n<p><strong> Avoid taking on too much responsibility in Charity Science. </strong>So far, I\u2019ve begun by being candid about what I can and cannot do and avoiding taking on     additional work. I haven\u2019t committed to a particular hour target yet (especially now that I dislike hours targets), but that might be a good idea if I     still find myself doing too much. I expect to evaluate this goal by asking \u201cis Charity Science work stressing me out?\u201d, which the answer is currently yes,     but hopefully will be no by Q2.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_EA_Survey\">The EA Survey</h2>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Right3\"> What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p>First and foremost, <a href=\"/ea/gb/the_2014_survey_of_effective_altruists_results/\">I finally finished it.</a></p>\n<p>Second, while doing the EA survey did not teach me programming, per se, it definitely served as a good benchmark for my development as an R programmer.     When I first started the survey analysis back in September, I wrote quite clunky script. Eventually, by November I learned a little bit more about what I was doing and created <a href=\"http://www.github.com/peterhurford/surveytools\">surveytools</a>. But later in January I learned about the<a href=\"http://www.github.com/hadley/dplyr\">dplyr library</a> and realized that surveytools was duplicative and inferior, and I wrote    <a href=\"http://www.github.com/peterhurford/surveytools2\">surveytools2</a> based off of dplyr.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Wrong2\"> What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever fallen prey to the planning fallacy quite this badly. This project had significant time overruns and I feel bad for not being able     to complete it in a timely manner. But I definitely learned a good lesson about how long analysis takes, how to do it more quickly, and what I can and     cannot take on given my workload.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the next time the analysis happens, it should go much more quickly, because the hard problems (in R analysis, though not survey methodology) have     been largely solved.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"_The_FB_Veg_Advocacy_Study\"><strong> The FB Veg Advocacy Study</strong></h2>\n<p>In Q3, Jason Ketola and I designed a study to determine the effectiveness of advertising pro-vegetarian videos on Facebook. In Q4, Jason and I teamed up     with Mercy for Animals to implement the study, acquiring $75K in funding.</p>\n<p>Since the study is ongoing in the field collecting responses, I did not have to do anything for this in Q1. I also don\u2019t expect to have to do anything in     Q2.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Learning\">Learning</h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve been trying to learn R programming (to get better at my job), mathematics (to get better at my job), and Chinese (just because it\u2019s fun).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"What_Went_Right\">What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p>I actually sat down and learned stuff!</p>\n<p>\n</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Programming: </strong>I\u2019ve completed 55% of Hadley Wickham\u2019s <a href=\"http://adv-r.had.co.nz/\">Advanced R</a> and 33% of Wickham\u2019s    <a href=\"http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/\">R Packages</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Math:</strong> I\u2019ve \u201cmastered\u201d 40% of <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/algebra2\">Algebra II on Khan Academy</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chinese:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.memrise.com/\">Memrise</a> says I have 181 Chinese words in my long-term memory.<a href=\"http://www.skritter.com/\">Skritter</a> says I\u2019ve learned 40 Chinese words.

I don\u2019t want to go into too much detail because     I do want to protect the privacy of others and have some privacy myself. I\u2019m also struggling in this area, deciding what I do and do not want from my     social life, how I do and do not want to review it, and what I do and do not want to share publicly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Right_\"> What Went Right </strong></p>\n<p><strong>My girlfriend:</strong> I think our relationship overall grew much stronger over these past three months.

I also got to visit him in late March.</p>\n<p><strong> Local friends:</strong> I\u2019ve been making more of an effort to get to know my co-workers. I also have one friend from college who also lives in Chicago, who I\u2019ve     been seeing regularly.</p>\n<p><strong> Distant friends:</strong> I\u2019m glad that I got to see a good amount of my college friends in late March.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Wrong4\"> What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p><strong> My girlfriend:</strong> Quite a lot of the time this past three months I ended up planning rather terribly, neglecting my girlfriend and not considering her needs.     I\u2019m saddened by having hurt her that way.</p>\n<p><strong> My brother:</strong> My brother and I have both agreed that we want to stay in touch more consistently, but we haven\u2019t developed a consistent schedule yet.

Unfortunately, I\u2019ve     struggled with these three so far my entire life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"What_Went_Right1\">What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p>I\u2019m happy with the health of my current, vegetarian diet. I have taken    <a href=\"http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART02840/How-to-Eat-in-Seven-Words.html\">the words of wisdom of Michael Pollan</a> to make it not much more     complicated than to \u201cEat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" I get a good amount of fruits and vegetables in my diet every day and don\u2019t eat too much junk     food. There\u2019s probably room for improvement, as I could stand to eat less and to maybe eat less bread. But I\u2019m happy with where I am.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_What_Went_Wrong_\"> What Went Wrong </strong></p>\n<p>While food is on target, exercise and sleep are not.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been struggling with going to sleep at a reasonable time (i.e., before midnight), getting up at a reasonable time (i.e., before 9am), and sleeping a     reasonable amount of time (my problem is actually oversleeping, not undersleeping like most Americans). This has created a bad morning routine which has     worsened my work life, and, from there, worsened my personal life.</p>\n<p>Exercise has not been great either. I\u2019ve kept things steady at 1.4hrs/wk, which is the same as 2014 Q4, so at least things have not gotten worse. And by     many measures, I should be exercising enough, as I walk 30 minutes every day commuting to work (12-15 minutes both ways), and frequently walk (or even run)     up the six flights of stairs to my apartment. However, I\u2019d still like to have a routine of going to the gym at least once every week, not to mention twice     or three times. I\u2019d also like to do the same with running. I think both are reasonable goals for getting more healthy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"_Q2_Goals_1\"> Q2 Goals </strong></p>\n<p>For my goals in this area, I\u2019d like to create the reasonable goals of (1) getting to work by 9:30am more often than not (since this would mean I\u2019m waking     up well enough and having a decent morning routine) and (2) going to gym at least once a week and running at least once a week.</p>\n<p>If I\u2019ve been struggling with both sleep and exercise since the beginning, it\u2019s a bit silly to just re-commit to the same goals every time. Instead, I must     follow the rule which asks \u201cIf you\u2019ve failed in the past, what will be different about this time?\u201d. To this, I answer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I\u2019m committing to much less difficult goals than usual. For example, going to the gym once a week instead of 2-3 times; getting to work more often             than not by 9:30am, rather than all the time by 8am. This should build me a success spiral toward where I really want to go.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I\u2019ve put things under the watchful eye of <a href=\"http://www.beeminder.com\">Beeminder</a>. While many times I end up paying money on Beeminder, at             least it lets me notice and feel the sting. For exercise, I\u2019m beeminding time spent both in the gym and running, and for sleep I\u2019m beeminding both             bedtime and the time I get to work. (I\u2019m also beeminding my diet, even though I think that\u2019s going ok.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I\u2019m going to consider some secret weapons. For sleep, buying a            <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HF3520-Wake-Up-Colored-Simulation/dp/B0093162RM?tag=s4charity-20\">wake-up light</a>.

In the previous month, and in nearly every month since, protests against racism in the criminal justice system have roiled nearly every major U.S. city. This comes in a decade when the national conversation has already been shaped profoundly by the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street.</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span><span>It's common to view participation in mass protests as a choice. I want to argue that, sometimes, participation in protests is not a choice: it is wrong not to participate.</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span><span>I don\u2019t claim that community or solidarity or anything like that has inherent importance. Instead, I want to argue that it may be immoral to stay home from a protest because doing so causes harm.</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span><span>To start, I offer perhaps the most influential thought experiment of contemporary times \u2013 one that has led thousands of people associated with a movement called Effective Altruism to commit their lifetime earnings to addressing extreme poverty. The thought experiment comes from Peter Singer's\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1972----.htm\">Famine, Affluence and Morality</a><span>:</span></p>\n<p><span>If I am walking past a shallow pond and see a child drowning in it, I ought to wade in and pull the child out. This will mean getting my clothes muddy, but this is insignificant, while the death of the child would presumably be a very bad thing.</span></p>\n<p><span>By analogy, Singer argues, we are obligated to save children in developing countries by donating our money, even if it comes at the cost of our own wants.</span></p>\n<p><span>In\u00a0<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=JOMDsm5Gn9kC&amp;dq=more+than+good+intentions+drowning+child&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s\">More Than Good Intentions</a>, economist Dean Karlan extends this pond analogy. Suppose I don't know how to save the child - I can jump in after him or I can throw something to him in the water. Knowing which is more effective could save his life. By analogy, if we are obligated to help those suffering from extreme poverty, we are obligated to figure out the most effective way to help them. Unsurprisingly, Karlan is the founder of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.poverty-action.org/\">Innovations for Poverty Action</a>, a nonprofit (where, full disclosure, I work) that is dedicated to finding effective solutions to global poverty.</span></p>\n<p><span>I'd like to extend the pond analogy in a different way. Suppose I am walking past a deep pond and see a child drowning in it. The child is drowning in the middle of the pond, where I would have to swim in to get him. This is not safe - I\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.swimmersdaily.com/2014/02/12/simple-step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-save-someone-who-is-drowning/\">risk being pulled in by the drowning victim</a><span>. Instead, I see a large plank of wood that I could throw to the child as a flotation device. With a group of about 10 people, we could throw the wood to the middle of the pond to reach the child. Any less, and we would not be strong enough for it to reach the child. There is no time to run and get any additional people.</span></p>\n<p><span>If there are nine other people around the lake determined to help, I ought to assist them in throwing the plank of wood. The choice isn't much different from that in the original analogy. If there are eight\u00a0people, and I really know that we need at least ten to throw it, then it seems I am under no obligation to assist. If there are ten or more, then I am again under no obligation to assist, because they will save the child on their own.</span></p>\n<p><span>Now the number should not really matter for this decision - if it takes one million people to throw the plank of wood and I am the millionth person, then my obligation is equally strong. Similarly, it should not matter whether the child is in a far away country, living in the far future, or of a different species.</span></p>\n<p><span>Clearly, this example is both trivial and unrealistic. So we can relax some the assumptions. Maybe I don't know how many people it will take to throw the plank of wood. In that case, if there is still a significant chance I am the threshold person, and I don\u2019t have an equally pressing need to rush off to, I am obligated to help the group.</span></p>\n<p><span>We can modify the thought experiment in another way: maybe there isn't a sharp cutoff where we can suddenly throw the plank, but each additional person helps get the plank a little bit closer. Again, this modification is easily dealt with - if I significantly increase the chance that the plank reaches the child, I am obligated to assist (and given that a child's life is on the line, I don't need to make much of a contribution for it to be wrong to sit out).</span></p>\n<p><span>We can modify this hypothetical in further ways, but the basic idea is clear: if collective action can produce major change, and my potential contribution is large enough, it is wrong to stay home. If a collective action\u2019s potential impact is great, even a tiny contribution to it may be morally required.</span></p>\n<p><span>Singer\u2019s pond analogy makes very salient our individual obligation to those in need. The growing numbers of people \u2013 termed</span><span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"/\">Effective Altruists</a><span>\u00a0</span><span>\u2013 who take his analogy seriously are changing the world in a meaningful way. I would identify myself as an EA and encourage readers of my blog to join this compelling and rapidly growing movement. Effective Altruists (EAs) are collaborating more and more to build a community. But EAs\u2019 outward engagement with the world tends to focus overly narrowly on ways to act alone. Donating to effective charities and eating a vegan diet are important and necessary ways to relieve suffering, but sometimes, more traditional collective action is required too. I fear a movement centered around doing the most good risks doing far less good for overlooking more traditional forms of protest.</span></p>\n<p><span>The months following the People\u2019s Climate March saw a new accord between the U.S. and China, the defeat of the Keystone XL pipeline in the U.S. Senate, and the growth of a</span><span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2015/4/16/harvard_students_expand_blockade_calling_for\">vibrant fossil fuels divestment movement</a><span>\u00a0</span><span>across the U.S. The #blacklivesmatter marches that have swept the country are leading police departments even in cities untouched by the national spotlight to revise their training.

If we can contribute meaningfully to it \u2013 which if we cannot do as an individual activist, we almost certainly can as an organizer \u2013 we have no choice but to do so.</span></p>\n<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings> <o:AllowPNG /> </o:OfficeDocumentSettings> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:WordDocument> <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom> <w:TrackMoves>false</w:TrackMoves> <w:TrackFormatting /> <w:PunctuationKerning /> <w:DrawingGridHorizontalSpacing>18 pt</w:DrawingGridHorizontalSpacing> <w:DrawingGridVerticalSpacing>18 pt</w:DrawingGridVerticalSpacing> <w:DisplayHorizontalDrawingGridEvery>0</w:DisplayHorizontalDrawingGridEvery> <w:DisplayVerticalDrawingGridEvery>0</w:DisplayVerticalDrawingGridEvery> <w:ValidateAgainstSchemas /> <w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>false</w:SaveIfXMLInvalid> <w:IgnoreMixedContent>false</w:IgnoreMixedContent> <w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>false</w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText> <w:Compatibility> <w:BreakWrappedTables /> <w:DontGrowAutofit /> <w:DontAutofitConstrainedTables /> <w:DontVertAlignInTxbx /> </w:Compatibility> </w:WordDocument> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:LatentStyles DefLockedState=\"false\" LatentStyleCount=\"276\"> </w:LatentStyles> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> <mce:style><! /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:\"\"; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} --> <!--[endif] --> <!--StartFragment--> <!--EndFragment--></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p></div></div>"},

Last week, the Global Priorities Project hosted one on how to compare very different goods, and I thought people on the forum might be interested in some of the considerations that came up. This is just a couple of the points which I remember being made \u2013 it\u2019s not a defence of a particular view, or a particular person\u2019s stance. I did try to pick out a somewhat coherent thread to make it a more interesting post.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<h1 id=\"Time_and_units_of_benefit\"><span>Time and units of benefit</span></h1>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span><span> </span></span><span>One thing that makes it more difficult to compare between benefits is that they seem to have different natural units. That\u2019s just true because some ways of helping people improve their lives in different ways. It\u2019s also because different benefits seem to naturally manifest at different times.</span></p>\n<p><span>For example, say that I\u2019m trying to decide between treating TB or trying to reduce the impact that climate change will have in hundreds of years time. A natural way to compare these might seem to be to ask how many lives I could save over the next year by treating TB, and how many lives I could save in, say, 300 years time (in expectation) by reducing carbon emission. However, doing that wouldn\u2019t be comparing like to like. One reason is that treating TB this year would also have an impact on the state of the world in 300 years time. What that impact would be is very hard to determine. But so is the impact of a particular intervention aimed at reducing climate change\u2019s harm in hundreds of years time. Treating TB this year seems likely to have positive flow through effects on the future \u2013 whether that\u2019s through economic benefit which lasts into the future, or the burden from TB being slightly reduced over the long-term. (Additionally, both of these would also make society more able to adapt to climate change.)</span></p>\n<p><span>So how should our reasoning change if we want to make sure that we compare like with like when it comes to interventions aimed at different time periods? One upshot is that it means that questions surrounding how many people will exist in the future are less important than we might have thought. If we compared how many lives we can save from TB next year to how many we could save from climate change in 300 years time, it would be very important how many people there are around in 300 years time to save. But if we take into account the fact that saving people from TB this year will have an impact in 300 years time too, comparing difference in effectiveness of the two interventions no longer depends straightforwardly on the number of people in the future, since the impact of both is likely to be higher, the more people there are in future.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<h1 id=\"Future_consequences_of_benefits\"><span>Future consequences of benefits</span></h1>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span><span> </span></span><span>The preceding section highlighted the importance of knowing whether interventions that are beneficial in the short term are likely to be beneficial in the long term. For the kinds of interventions we tend to consider \u2013 ones that improve global health or increase education or income \u2013 it seems plausible that this is the case. After all, if people are healthier or more educated they typically become richer, and which allows them to invest in more education and research in the future, and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, we might want to question that assumption. We might think that it is not generally the case that current benefits increase the chance/quantity of future benefits, but that that is only the case in times of peace. If you\u2019re a nation at war with another nation, you are likely to want to the other nation to be less developed and poorer. However, overall wars seem less likely to happen if nations are more prosperous and resources are not scarce.</span></p>\n<p><span>A second reason for questioning the idea that current benefits will lead to future benefits is the fact that in nature populations tend to experience cycles. A population of rabbits might increase until the point where it was overstretching the food supply, at which point many would starve and the population would decrease. Or the increase in rabbits would be followed by foxes proliferating, which would shrink the rabbit population. If humans are relevantly similar to other species, perhaps we should expect that short term benefits to humanity will simply hasten a time when there is a lack of resources. One reason to think that humans are not relevantly similar to other species, however, is our capacity for adaptation. Far more than other animals, we are able to change which resources we use. Therefore it doesn\u2019t seem necessary that current benefits speed-up harm coming to us \u2013 it seems more likely that (very broadly speaking) benefiting people today improves their future. An exception might be harm coming from advancing technology, which could be sped up if current benefits increase the rate of technological progress.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<h1 id=\"How_uncertainty_about_interventions_might_affect_our_choices\"><span>How uncertainty about interventions might affect our choices</span></h1>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span><span> </span></span><span>Say that we thought that we could save more lives in 300 years than we can now, because we think there will be more people in 300 years. In that case, even if we think that treating TB now will have a positive effect in 300 years time, it seems likely that we would still want to opt for directly tackling climate change. After all, an intervention that is directly aiming at improving the state of the world in 300 years time seems more likely to do that than one which is aiming at helping people this year.</span></p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span><span> </span></span><span>On the other hand, it seems very difficult to know how good interventions which aim to minimise the harm of climate change in 300 years time are. For one thing, we can\u2019t test their relative efficacies. On the other hand, we know quite a lot about health interventions and we certainly can test and compare them. Since that\u2019s the case, even if the average current health intervention was worse than the average future-oriented intervention, it might be that we would be better off supporting current health interventions. The reason is that we can tell which the best health interventions are, and we might expect those to be better than the average future-oriented interventions.</span></p></div></div>"},

The few times that I have didn't go very well. I didn't receive any counterarguments, it was just clear that the people I was talking to were generally unconvinced. The main reason why I don't tell anyone around me about effective altruism is because I expect these reactions. </span></p>\n<p><span>The closest I'll come is telling some people I plan to donate a lot of money in the future and that I want to be smart about how I do it. I think this substitute explanation of EA (one that doesn't actually explain EA at all but instead offers a socially acceptable proxy) is likely to get far better reactions. In my personal experience, people are supportive of philanthropy so long as you don't come off as <em>weird</em> or as some sort of fanatic. </span></p>\n<p><span>This is similar to the <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/03/all-in-all-another-brick-in-the-motte/\">motte-and-bailey fallacy</a>, where effective altruists tell each other that they're about, say maximizing total expected utility according to a hedonistic utilitarian framework, but only tell \"the public\" that they want to donate a lot and make sure their donations count. The \"true\" explanation of EA - that is, the definition that most of us more or less actually agree with - is swapped for a more easily defensible, socially acceptable explanation.</span></p>\n<p><span>Maybe this is just routine, common sense marketing.</span></p></div></div>"},

Data from the recently published 2014 EA Survey suggests that roughly 75% of EAs are consequentialists. Common EA rhetoric focuses on doing the maximum good, choosing the best possible cause, or perhaps donating as much as you can.</p>\n<p>But another common occurrence is for EAs to profess how much joy earning to give brings them, how fulfilling they find it, how little their donations disadvantage them because of the declining marginal utility of money, or about excited altruism more generally.</p>\n<p>The Maximum Philanthropy effective altruist lifestyle doesn't seem to be coming from a place of Maximum Selflessness. In some situations, it even seems to come from a place of outright self-benefit.

What if I openly proclaimed that I was going to donate all my money for 100% selfish reasons? Should I be docked points?

I think a big factor is many of us don't favor only one cause, and which cause we favor \"the most\" doesn't capture exactly capture how we would like our thoughts and actions to be represented. For example, the analysis of the survey noted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Despite \u201canimal welfare\u201d being a less popular cause than other causes, there appears to be a widespread concern for reducing meat among EAs, with 69.1% of EAs at least reducing the amount of meat they eat, a 33.1% vegan/vegetarian rate, and a 15.6% vegan rate. While it\u2019s hard to get reliable national statistics, it seems indisputable that the vegetarianism / veganism rate is much higher than the US national average of ~3% vegetarian and ~0.5% vegan.\u00a0</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span> <span> </span></span>This indicates a concern for non-human animal welfare or rights within effective altruism beyond the 8.4% of survey respondents who responded they believe animal advocacy is the cause to work in where they believe the most good can be done. Many people may care about non-human animals, and thus are vegan or vegetarian, but believe either the forms of animal advocacy effective altruism has examined don't make it a tractable cause at the present time. They may also or otherwise believe while, e.g., reducing or eliminating factory farming is important, primarily working in other cause areas is more important and/or tractable. Regarding the third of survey respondents who reduce their meat consumption, this could be due to how some of us are uncertain about what moral weight to grant to non-human animals. As an anecdote, I know multiple friends and peers who entered effective altruism originally favoring other causes, but became vegetarians or reduced their level of meat consumption due to their exposure to arguments and reasoning from other effective altruists advocating for animals.\u00a0</p>\n<p><span> <span> </span></span>Another confounding factor is many causes provided for the question on the survey overlap. \"Politics\" could overlap with any cause, including political advocacy for any other mentioned causes. \"Cause Prioritization\", and the \"far future\" are also vague, arguably spurious, causes, allowing overlap with virtually any other cause. Any effective altruist could favor a specific cause (area), while also thinking \"cause prioritization\" and the \"far future\" are possibly the most important things ever, because who doesn't want to know what the best actions to take are, or how to preserve what we value for the indefinite future? <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies\">Concern for A.I. Risks</a>\u00a0alone has virtual overlap with concern for existential risks, but doesn't why and how we're concerned about other existential risks. The idea of \"meta-charity\" is one perhaps unique to effective altruism, geared towards funding and supporting organizations within effective altruism which support and advocate for other causes more among the public more broadly, or research what new causes we should favor. This latter part of \"meta-charity\" seems indistinguishable from \"cause prioritization\".\u00a0</p>\n<h1 id=\"It_s_Okay_to_Have_Complicated_Opinions\"><span>It's Okay to Have Complicated Opinions</span></h1>\n<p><span> <span> </span></span>These confusions and uncertainties aside, it's difficult enough for each of us as individuals trying to make hard ethical decisions based on mixed interpretations of limited information. I myself and dozens of other effective altruists I know are not so confident in supporting any single cause (area) that they don't believe which cause they favor most could switch in a matter of months. Also, the partnership between charity evaluator Givewell and foundation Good Ventures could return research causing us to favor new causes that currently aren't greatly represented within effective altruism, such as concern for <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/labs/policy\">advocacy of various and specific policies</a>, <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/labs/scientific-research-funding\">scientific research</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/biosecurity\">biosecurity</a>. What drew many of us to effective altruism in the first place was the idea of figuring out how to do the most good, without already having a specific cause in mind as one promising the most opportunity for doing good. Our minds can or will change. Effective altruism is a young movement, and the landscape of what causes may not be so stable.</p>\n<p><span> <span> </span></span>I believe all these considerations are frequently overlooked in conversations in effective altruism. I've followed many conversations within effective altruism discussing the various pros and cons of specific cause areas. These conversations don't often leave room for us expressing uncertainty to explain how we have hope and skepticism, both unresolved, for multiple cause areas. I think those of us holding such opinions might represent a plurality of effective altruists. This may not be captured in either any statistics, or common impressions, of effective altruism. On the other hand, those of us with great confidence a single cause carries more opportunity to do the most good than any other cause may not often have way to put forward our best arguments for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p><span> <span> <span> </span></span></span><em>So, I welcome you to make the case in the comments for why you believe what cause(s) do or don't provide the best opportunity for doing the most good, or not</em>. Remember when doing so to be <a href=\"/ea/7x/supportive_scepticism/\">supportive of others in discussion and debate</a>.</p></div></div>"},

{"date": "27th Jan 2015", "title": "Does It Make Sense to Make Multi-Year Donation Commitments to One Organization?", "author": "Evan_Gaensbauer", "num_comments": "7 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span>The following is my answer to a question posted in the January open thread:</span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Do you think it is better to decide each year where to donate, or to give organizations multi-year commitments of what you expect to donate?</span><span> </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Short Answer</span></p>\n<p><span>It's better to decide each year where to donate if you're donating less than several thousand dollars per year, and you don't have very high confidence where to donate. If you donate several thousand dollars per year, or in excess of that, and you don't believe your donation preferences will change much, it may make sense to let organizations know you expect to donate to them for several years.</span></p>\n<p><span>Long Answer</span></p>\n<p><span>The following answer is based on my experience as having previously worked for a charity fundraising company, been a regular monthly donor to World Animal Protection, and the experiences of myself and other supporters of effective altruism as donors.</span></p>\n<p><span>Donations In General</span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span>Based on work and personal experience, it seems most charities, and non-profits, are much more concerned with their short- and medium-term operation and goals. That's because the continuance of the organization is based on meeting these goals, and achieving long-term goals is based upon the organization still existing, e.g., several years from now. Thus, my impression is that most charities and non-profits are relieved enough that their base of donors lets them know they'll continue to donate on a monthly basis, never mind an annual one.</span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span>Of course, organizations want this information because it gives them a confidence interval for much funding they'll receive, which in turn dictates their budget for operations and projects. The biggest donors to an organization will have the greatest impact on an organization's budget, and its expectations of future funding. These donors are the ones organizations will focus on getting information on donation plans from on a year-to-year basis. Ask yourself: are you among the biggest donors to an organization?</span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span>As an example, the <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/\">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> publishes a <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/topdonors/\">list of its top donors</a> over its history. A 'top donor' is someone who has donated </span><span><em>=&gt;$5000 USD</em></span><span> to the MIRI. <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a> also publishes a <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/donate/top-donors/\">list of its own top donors</a>, one of their 'top donors' being someone who has donated </span><span><em>=&gt;$1000</em></span><span>. The MIRI has existed longer than ACE has, and also has a greater operating budget. So, what would qualify you as a 'top donor' varies by organization. If you believe you fall into the category of 'top donor' to an organization, and will do so in the future, making a multi-year commitment may make sense. If you don't know the answer to the question, you can always ask the organization.</span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span>Just ask them, out of curiosity, what percentage your donation makes up of their total operating budget, and how much your regular donations impact their medium-term budget planning. At this point, you have no obligation to disclose you're considering a multi-year commitment to donating to the organization in question.</span></p>\n<p><span>Donations and Effective Altruism</span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span>I believe the concerns of donors influenced by effective altruism make it so making a multi-year commitment to an organization that you expect to donate to them is not as good an idea.</span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span>First of all, effective organizations, such as Givewell-recommended charities, may run into <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_for_more_funding\">room for more funding issues</a></span><span>. This means organizations may hit a point at which the marginal donation to that organization will do less good than the same amount donated to a different organization. For example, at the end of 2013, Givewell believed its normally top-recommended charity, the Against Malaria Foundation, hadn't distributed enough malaria bed nets, or had the capacity to effectively allocate funds, such that Givewell recommended GiveDirectly as its top charity over Against Malaria Foundation for most of 2014. This was controversial within effective altruism, as several individuals, and also Giving What We Can, disagreed with Givewell's analysis and conclusion on regarding the AMF.</span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span>Anyway, similar issues may be raised in the future. Now, in a way, most of us don't believe ourselves as capable or experienced as Givewell or Giving What We Can to evaluate charities. So, we trust them to do so on behalf of the movement. If, as an individual, you make a multi-year commitment to organization, it may be awkward in future years when a charity evaluator you trust no longer recommends that organization as the 'best place to donate'. Given that effective altruism focuses on supporting the most effective organizations for any present time, what's considered 'the best place to donate' may change relatively quickly. This would render a multi-year donation commitment sub-optimal, and may make a relationship with an organization more awkward.</span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span>Of course, some of us donated lots of money to the Against Malaria Foundation in 2013, then switched to GiveDirectly in 2014, and will resume donating to the AMF in 2015, now that it's Givewell's top recommendation again. Still, the opportunity for such flexibility is still a point against a multi-year commitment.</span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span>Some causes areas are popular within effective altruism because to some they seem very neglected, or hold lots of value, even though they're not as tractable as global poverty. Such cause areas include animal advocacy, or existential risk reduction. By 'tractable', I mean to what extent we're confident what we do in the present will lead to desired goods in the future. Sometimes figuring if a cause area is tractable is difficult because the evidence to reach a conclusion hasn't been collected or evaluated yet, or because building an evidence base just seems too difficult.</span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span>Now, the MIRI, and ACE, are organizations working within cause areas for which it's much more difficult to discern how effective and positive financial and other support in the present will be. However, I believe that the novel introduction of greater effectiveness to cause areas may change them such that evaluating their tractability will be more possible. At such a point, you as an individual, or the effective altruism community at large, may conclude organizations within your selected cause area are more or less effective than you once though. So, this could shift your donation priorities within a couple of years. Thus, I believe accounting for this level of uncertainty about the effectiveness of a given organization over time is another mark against making multi-year commitments.</span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span>As someone who isn't very confident in which cause area, let alone which charity, may be the most effective target for donations, I wouldn't be making a multi-year commitment for donation even if I currently had the funds to justify such a thing. If you're extremely confident a single organization is the best, or confident in a single organization within the best cause area, a multi-year commitment could still make sense. However, keep in mind you may be biased if you're (one of) the only supporters of effective altruism with such high confidence in this organization. <strong> </strong></span>\n</p><h1 id=\"Conclusion\"><span><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h1>\n<p></p>\n<p><span><span>In conclusion, I believe from the perspective of effective altruism, making a multi-year commitment to organizations is usually not the best plan of action. However, I wrote this post as an example of going through different considerations, not an ultimate guide. I believe considerations will vary with each individual, who should use their own discretion, and seek input from their peers and mentors. If you're reading this, and have had a hand in managing a non-profit organization, or were a donor to one organization for multiple years on end, please come forward with your own perspective in the comments.</span></span></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "24th Jan 2015", "title": "Comments on Ernest Davis's comments on Bostrom's Superintelligence", "author": "Giles", "num_comments": "8 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Link: <a href=\"http://www.cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/papers/Bostrom.pdf\">Ethical Guidelines for a Superintelligence</a> by Ernest Davis, NYU. October 2014.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"/ea/e0/january_open_thread/2dr\">davidc</a> for pointing this one out. Nick Bostrom represents one side of EA - xrisk with a focus on artificial intelligence - that deserves more intelligent criticism. So it's certainly refreshing to see these comments by Davis.</p>\n<p>I'll add my thoughts here (I figured they'd be long enough for a top-level post). Note: I have very little connection with FHI or MIRI - I certainly don't represent them in any way. This will make a lot more sense if you've read at least part way through the book, or are otherwise familiar with Bostrom's position on machine intelligence. Otherwise, <a href=\"http://astore.amazon.co.uk/ea-astore-embed-21/detail/B00LOOCGB2\">read the book :D</a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Davis doesn't significantly misrepresent Bostrom's point of view as far as I can tell</li>\n<li>Davis correctly points out that Bostrom doesn't go into multi-dimensional models of intelligence (and intelligence explosions) enough</li>\n<li>Davis points out that Bostrom may have a bit too much of an affection for transhumanist morality and the anthropic principle</li>\n<li>Extrapolating the moral taboos of some well-respected people isn't a <em>terrible</em> way to construct an AI morality, and I hope it gets added in to the conversation, but it's not enough to render the rest of the conversation moot</li>\n<li>I think Davis needs to work on steelmanning some of his other arguments</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a></a>Davis's review starts with an overview of the key message in Bostrom's book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nick Bostrom, in his new book <em>SuperIntelligence</em>, argues that, sooner or later, one way or another, it is very likely that an artificial intelligence (AI) will achieve intelligence comparable to a human. Soon after this has happened \u2014 probably within a few years, quite possibly within hours or minutes \u2014 the AI will attain a level of intelligence immensely greater than human. There is then a serious danger that the AI will achieve total dominance of earthly society, and bring about nightmarish, apocalyptic changes in human life. Bostrom describes various horrible scenarios and the paths that would lead to them in grisly detail. He expects that the AI might well then turn to large scale interstellar travel and colonize the galaxy and beyond. He argues, therefore, that ensuring that this does not happen must be a top priority for mankind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems like a good summary of Bostrom's viewpoint. I'd only disagree with the word \"grisly\" - I find Bostrom's tone to be pretty gentle. And maybe he's overstating the probabilities a touch.</p>\n<p>Davis likes the \"Paths\" section of the book, which explains how a superintelligence could come about. But he has some reservations about the \"Dangers\" and \"Strategies\". I'll go through his complaints here and add my own thoughts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_assumption_that_intelligence_is_a_potentially_infinite_quantity_with_a_well_defined__one_dimensional_value\">The assumption that intelligence is a potentially infinite quantity with a well-defined, one-dimensional value</h2>\n<p>It's pretty clear that Bostrom doesn't actually believe this. The point Davis is trying to make is more sophisticated than this - and I'll get to that next - but first I just want to make clear that Bostrom doesn't think intelligence is something like mass or height with a \"well-defined, one-dimensional value\". Here's Bostrom:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It would be convenient if we could quantify the cognitive caliber of an arbitrary cognitive system using some familiar metric, such as IQ scores or some version of the Elo ratings that measure the relative abilities of players in two-player games such as chess. But these metrics are not useful in the context of superhuman artificial general intelligence. <strong>[snip]</strong> suppose we could somehow establish that a certain future AI will have an IQ of 6,455: then what? We would have no idea of what such an AI could actually do. We would not even know that such an AI had as much general intelligence as a normal human adult - perhaps the AI would instead have a bundle of special-purpose algorithms enabling it to solve typical intelligence test questions with superhuman efficiency but not much else.</p>\n<p>Some recent efforts have been made to develop measurements of cognitive capacity that could be applied to a wider range of information-processing systems, including artificial intelligences. Work in this direction, if it can overcome various technical difficulties, may turn out to be quite useful for some scientific purposes including AI development. For purposes of the present investigation, however, its usefulness would be limited since we would remain unenlightened about what a given superhuman performance score entails for actual ability to achieve practically important outcomes in the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bostrom argues for various different flavours of AI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Different outputs (or \"superpowers\") that an AI might command: strategizing, social manipulation, hacking etc.</li>\n<li>Different structures (or \"forms\") of superintelligence: speed superintelligence, collective superintelligence, and quality superintelligence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, might Bostrom be paying lip-service to non-one-dimensionalness while still relying on it for his central models and arguments? Davis claims:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if you loosen the idealization, important parts of the argument become significantly weaker, such as Bostrom\u2019s expectation that the progress from human intelligence to superhuman intelligence will occur quickly</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's have a look at chapter 4: the kinetics of an intelligence explosion. Bostrom's equation is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rate of change in intelligence = Optimization power / Recalcitrance</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's important to note that optimization power isn't the same as intelligence. In this equation you can think of optimization power as something more like money - it's something you can throw at a problem and maybe make some progress, as long as the recalcitrance isn't too high. It's a one-dimensional quantity.</p>\n<p>Intelligence is a vector.</p>\n<p>Recalcitrance, however, could be a vector too. Depending on how the project is going, and what the theoretical hurdles turn out to be, different aspects of intelligence might advance at different rates. The equation is still valid, if you interpret it as a vector equation (and you take some liberties in notation by dividing by a vector).</p>\n<p>I'm not sure this is what Bostrom intended though, and he certainly didn't say it. I think that chapter 4 would have been stronger if it had considered non-one dimensional models.</p>\n<p>But we can still take the spirit chapter 4. Suppose intelligence is a multi-faceted thing, with the different factors having different recalcitrances and feeding into optimization power differently. I think you'd still expect a fast takeoff, unless there was some kind of bottleneck: all the factors of intelligence relevant to optimization power hit a roadblock (or each hit a separate roadblock).</p>\n<p>I think there's a fruitful discussion to be had here in any case. Bring out the multi-dimensional models!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, all that running faster does is to save you time. If you have two machines A and B and B runs ten times as fast as A, then A can do anything that B can do if you\u2019re willing to wait ten times as long.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote></blockquote>\n<p>Imagine you own a company, and you came into possession of a potion that would make employees do the same work ten times faster. What do you think would happen? Because I think that company would take over the world, <em>unless</em> the potion got leaked or sold to a rival company - this is essentially the difference between Eliezer Yudkowsky's and Robin Hanson's view of machine intelligence dynamics, at least as I understand it. (An intelligence explosion vs. lots of fast competing agents).</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_assumption_that_a_large_gain_in_intelligence_would_necessarily_entail_a_correspondingly_large_increase_in_power\">The assumption that a large gain in intelligence would necessarily entail a correspondingly large increase in power</h2>\n<p>Davis here appears to confuse intelligence with brain size, and is also still assuming that Bostrom is imagining a one-dimensional, clear-cut definition of intelligence.</p>\n<p>It's really hard to argue that a large gain in intelligence would entail <em>anything</em>, because everyone disagrees on what that word means. But there's an interesting discussion to be had here if we dissolve the concept of intelligence.</p>\n<p>Intelligence can be broken down into resources and abilities. Resources include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hardware\n<ul>\n<li>Speed at which that hardware runs</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Whether the hardware allows its software to be copied (no for brains, yes for ems)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Money</li>\n<li>Physical manipulators</li>\n<li>Knowledge</li>\n<li>Algorithms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Abilities include (roughly borrowed from Bostrom's \"superpowers\" list, though they may not necessarily be exhibited at the \"super\" level):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strategizing</li>\n<li>Social manipulation</li>\n<li>Hacking</li>\n<li>Technology research, including software</li>\n<li>Economic productivity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The discussion would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which important resources and abilities are missing from those lists?\u00a0</li>\n<li>Which resources imply which abilities?</li>\n<li>Which abilities allow further gains in which resources, in the sort of future world we'd expect to find the system in</li>\n<li>Which combination of abilities would suggest a lot of \"power\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think that thinking about these would yield some statements of the form \"a large gain in [something] would lead to a large gain in [other thing]\", some of which would be nontrivial. This basically brings us back to multidimensional models being cool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_assumption_that_large_intelligence_entails_virtual_omnipotence\">The assumption that large intelligence entails virtual omnipotence</h2>\n<p>As Bostrom and Davis both point out, this one swings both ways - it can lead to existential doom or \"messianic benefits\" (Davis's words) depending on whether the intelligence has friendly or unfriendly (or bizarre) motivations.</p>\n<p>Davis doesn't explain why Bostrom is wrong on this point. But using the model I hinted at above, we might imagine some upper limit on the resources and abilities that can be acquired by a system - witness the fact that no system (such as a government or corporation) has managed to take over the entire world yet. Bostrom argues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In human-run organizations, economies of scale are counteracted by bureaucratic inefficiencies and agency problems, including difficulties in keeping trade secrets. [snip] An AI system, however, might avoid some of these scale diseconomies, since the AI's modules (in contrast to human workers) need not have individual preferences that diverge from those of the system as a whole.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There's also a reference to the economic literature dealing with the theory of the firm.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_unwarranted_belief_that__though_achieving_intelligence_is_more_or_less_easy__giving_a_computer_an_ethical_point_of_view_is_really_hard\">The unwarranted belief that, though achieving intelligence is more or less easy, giving a computer an ethical point of view is really hard</h2>\n<p>Making a system behave ethically is trivially easy. \"Hello world\" does that. Your pocket calculator, and existing narrow AI systems, do that while still exhibiting interesting behaviour. Bear this in mind.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But if an AI is to be a master manipulator, it will need a good understanding of what people consider moral; if it comes across as completely amoral, it will be at a very great disadvantage in manipulating people</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I can see the following problem. An AI is programmed not to do anything it considers immoral. It formulates the plan to construct another AI with slightly weaker morality safeguards. Would people consider this immoral? If they're consequentialist then probably yes. If they're not, and most people aren't, then probably no, although depending how much they know about AI they might consider it \"foolish\" <em>which is a different thing from immoral</em>.</p>\n<p>But we're attacking a strawman here, as Davis proposes something more interesting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You specify a collection of admirable people, now dead. [snip] You then instruct the AI, \u201cDon\u2019t do anything that these people would have mostly seriously disapproved of.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that being dead is irrelevant here. You can equally well specify \"what a living person as of 2015 would have seriously disapproved of\".</p>\n<p>I'm guessing the spirit of this moral code is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to forbid taking over and establishing a singleton</li>\n<li>to allow passive behaviour, such as allowing a rival AI project to take over and establish a singleton</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I'm right, this runs into the problem of \"if your AI doesn't take over the world then someone else's soon will\".</p>\n<p>This aside, we can consider how the AI might behave. Following Bostrom's classification:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oracles give their operators a lot of power. But if the oracle is programmed not to do anything the wise people would disapprove of then it would stop answering questions once it realises it would give its operators too much power. Clever, huh?</li>\n<li>Genies similarly</li>\n<li>Sovereigns are ruled out if the wise people are forbidding establishing a singleton</li>\n<li>Tools probably aren't agenty enough to follow the proscription accurately</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So it sounds pretty good. It's basically \"take the coherent extrapolated volition of some dead people\", and it potentially suffers the problem of being too weedy. I think it suffers from the similar philosophical and implementation problems to anything CEV-like though - who knows what the wise dead people would have thought about low-fidelity ems, or nanobots distributing morphine to prevent wild animal suffering, or any of the other puzzles that may confront future society. You need to extrapolate and you need to aggregate opinions. And you need to choose the right people to start with.</p>\n<p>This reminds me a little of Holden Karnofsky's Tool AI. It's relatively easy to come to the conclusion that MIRI and FHI haven't done their homework, by proposing a candidate solution that they haven't explicitly mentioned yet. If they are to take their critics seriously, and I think they should, then such proposals will enter the conversation, and maybe even future editions of this book or its successors.</p>\n<p>But it doesn't mean the problem has gone away. It may be that extrapolating the volition of dead people is a really hard task for AI, and that other things such as initiating an economic takeover, are actually more straightforward. In that case we'd have the technology for a doomsday device before we had the suggested safeguard. And even if this isn't the case, while we're carefully building in all our safeguards, some foreign power will be hacking together any old rubbish, and as consequentialists we're responsible for the consequences of that.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This may not seem adequate to Bostrom, because he is not content with human morality in its current state; he thinks it is important for the AI to use its superintelligence to find a more ultimate morality. That seems to me both unnecessary and very dangerous.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, Bostrom can be a bit iffy when it comes to transhumanist topics. Moving on.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bostrom considers at length solving the problem of the out-of-control computer by suggesting to the computer that it might actually be living in a simulated universe, and if so, the true powers that be might punish it for making too much mischief</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, on the anthropic principle too. On the other hand, everyone else is iffy when it comes to the anthropic principle too, and I think Bostrom was just trying to be thorough here.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any machine should have an accessible \u201coff\u201d switch; and in the case of a computer or robot that might have any tendency toward self-preservation, it should have an off switch that it cannot block. However, in the case of computers and robots, this is very easily done, since we are building them. All you need is to place in the internals of the robot, inaccessible to it, a device that, when it receives a specified signal, cuts off the power or, if you want something more dramatic, triggers a small grenade. This can be done in a way that the computer probably cannot find out the details<br>of how the grenade is placed or triggered, and certainly cannot prevent it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goodness, Bostrom didn't consider the possibility that you could build a machine with an \"off\" switch?</p>\n<p>All the AI needs to do is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Play nice until it's figured out a way to kill everyone before they can get their hand to the off switch, <em>or</em></li>\n<li>Play nice until it's so entwined with the rest of the world's infrastructure that switching it off would be unthinkable, <em>or</em></li>\n<li>Play nice until its superintelligence has figured out where the off switch is, <em>or</em></li>\n<li>Accomplish its goal (e.g. building a million paperclips), then kill everyone to make sure the paperclips remain forever. The off switch gets triggered on somebody's death but the AI doesn't care, <em>or</em></li>\n<li>Play nice until it's built another AI somewhere which has the same goals but doesn't have an off switch, <em>or</em></li>\n<li>Play nice until it's wireheaded everyone so they don't care</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You get the idea. Manual off switches don't work when you're dealing with a master manipulator. Bostrom does discuss a number of safeguards (in particular \"tripwires\") that are a bit like off switches but smarter, but he discusses potential flaws in these too.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Something can always go wrong, or some foolish or malicious person might create a superintelligence with no moral sense and with control of its own off switch. I certainly have no objection to imposing restrictions...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's great! Davis is saying \"if your AI doesn't take over the world or at least do something really bad, then someone else's soon will unless there are restrictions\". This is pretty close to one of my own memes, and the differences are important, but I'm glad we could find some common ground.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p></div></div>"},

This would provide a tax credit of one dollar for each dollar of charitable giving, up to a certain limit, perhaps 10% of one\u2019s incomes. So if a taxpayer grossing $100,000 a year donates $10,000 dollars to the charity of his or her choice, he or she would receive a $10,000 tax credit.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cA decision to vote for the Choose-your-Charity Tax expresses a willingness to endure significant personal sacrifice, but only <em>willingness to do so if others match that willingness</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if others match, then the sacrifice is not a drop in the bucket, but a great wave of change \u2013 and the taxpayers know that. By matching contributions with over 100 million US taxpayers, it would be possible to solve <em>vast</em> problems. Roughly speaking, supporting such a policy is equivalent to being willing to give $1 when the personal price of giving that dollar is one-hundred-millionth of a dollar. This is the ultimate expansion of the proven \u201cmatching\u201d tactic that has already helped increase donations to charities.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

{"date": "13th Jul 2015", "title": "That UMD Extra Credit Question", "author": "zdgroff", "num_comments": "3 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Crossposted on zachgroff.com</p>\n<p><span>A discussion recently erupted with several friends over a tweet about an extra credit question posed by a professor at the University of Maryland:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>WHAT KIND OF PROFESSOR DOES THIS <a href=\"http://t.co/ACtQ0FCwRm\">pic.twitter.com/ACtQ0FCwRm</a></div>\n\u2014 name (@shaunhin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shaunhin/status/616378904752848896\">July 1, 2015</a></blockquote>\n<p><span>One of my friends commented that the rational thing to do is to select 6% - unless you happen to be that marginal student whose choice brings everyone down, you can only expect to gain by selecting 6%.</span><br><span><br></span><span>My immediate reaction was that, well no, that's the rational thing to do provided you are egoistic and only care about your own exam score. If you're a rational altruist, though, the rational thing to do may be to select 2%, since in the unlikely event that you are the marginal student, you threaten to lose points for everyone. Depending on the size of the class and the way you value each additional point on the exam, this could easily outweigh the slight chance of getting an extra 4% for yourself.</span><br><span><br></span><span>As is often the case, things are more complicated. The reason is this: what if there is a curve? If there's a curve, then additional points on the exam only serve to set you aside from anyone else, and if you cause everybody to lose their bonus points, you just leave the relative distribution unchanged. From an altruistic perspective, if the value of everybody's exam score is equal, then it's unclear which way to answer this question.</span><br><span><br></span><span>It's more likely that everybody's exam score is not equal, though. If I'm a truly effective, altruistic person and (almost) the rest of the class is not, then I should select 6%, since in the scheme of things, it's better for those who will do good with their credentials to outcompete those who won't.</span><br><span><br></span><span>The irony is that a radically altruistic position leads to the same choice as a radically egoistic one. It seems to me that this is likely the correct assessment. I could see worries that effective altruism could lead to a cutthroat world, but these are easily allayed by the fact that the calculation changes if I know that 10% of the class is likely to be effective altruists.</span><br><span><br></span><span>In fact, this could be somewhat comforting for those who worry about effective altruism requiring some holier-than-thou self-sacrifice. Certainly, a dose of self-sacrifice is called for. But if you want to be not simply altruistic but also effective, the best default way of behaving in many situations may be the rationally egoistic one.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p></div></div>"},

In other words, the merchandise would both help build community with fellow EAs since the merchandise would make EAs feel closer to each other and also remind each other of their commitment, but also serve as a means of outreach to others. All profit made on the merchandise would go to the cause of promoting Effective Altruism and rational thinking <a href=\"/ea/ov/improving_the_effectiveness_of_effective_altruism/\">effectively</a>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Intentional Insights <a href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/intentional_merchandise\">already has merchandise</a> designed to convey rational thinking, with slogans such as \"Glad To Change My Mind,\" \"Less Wrong Every Day,\" \"Please Provide An Example,\" and others. I would like to integrate some explicitly EA-themed slogans into this set, following the same format. Namely I'd appreciate ideas for slogans with 6 words or less that convey crucial ideas about the EA movement that would be engaging for non-EA members, without using jargon, and that you or other EAs you know would likely wear on a T-shirt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For example, a good slogan might be \"Doing Good Effectively By Using Reason\" since it fits both purposes, of cultivating an EA community and reminding each other of our commitments, and also of prompting others to ask us about how we do good effectively by using reason. A poor one would be \"Optimizing QALYs By Consequentialist Utilitarianism\" since that fulfills only the first purpose, but not the second, as it contains three words that most non-EAs would be unlikely to know.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for any ideas you have, and please upvote and comment on posts whose slogans you most approve.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>P.S. </span><span>This article is part of the </span><a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/EA-Marketing-Resource-Bank-Rq2ckmtIxUY\"><span>EA Marketing Resource Bank</span></a><span> project lead by </span><a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/Intentional-Insights-UTiM2viNkrp\"><span>Intentional Insights</span></a><span> and the </span><a href=\"http://dotimpact.im/focusprojects/lean/\"><span>Local Effective Altruism Network</span></a><span>, with support from </span><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\"><span>The Life You Can Save</span></a><span>.</span></p></div></div>"},

In an introductory post, <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2015/05/31/introductions/\">he announced</a> that he will join the effective altruism forum to answer your questions on Thursday next week. I hope you will join in with lots of questions about his plans at MIRI.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello, I\u2019m Nate Soares, and I\u2019m pleased to be taking the reins at MIRI on Monday morning.</p>\n<p>For those who don\u2019t know me, I\u2019ve been a research fellow at MIRI for a little over a year now. I attended my first MIRI workshop in December of 2013 while I was still working at Google, and was offered a job soon after. Over the last year, I wrote a dozen papers, half as primary author. Six of those papers were written for the\u00a0<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/technical-agenda/\">MIRI technical agenda</a>, which we compiled in preparation for the\u00a0<a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/misc/ai_conference\">Puerto Rico conference</a>\u00a0put on by FLI in January 2015. Our technical agenda is cited extensively in the<a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/static/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf\">research priorities document</a>\u00a0referenced by the\u00a0<a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/misc/open_letter\">open letter</a>\u00a0that came out of that conference. In addition to the Puerto Rico conference, I attended five other conferences over the course of the year, and gave a talk at three of them. I also put together the\u00a0<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/research-guide/\">MIRI research guide</a>\u00a0(a resource for students interested in getting involved with AI alignment research), and of course I spent a fair bit of time doing the actual research at workshops, at researcher retreats, and on my own. It\u2019s been a jam-packed year, and it\u2019s been loads of fun.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve always had a natural inclination towards leadership: in the past, I\u2019ve led a F.I.R.S.T. Robotics team, managed two volunteer theaters, served as president of an Entrepreneur\u2019s Club, and co-founded a startup or two. However, this is the first time I\u2019ve taken a professional leadership role, and I\u2019m grateful that I\u2019ll be able to call upon the experience and expertise of the board, of our advisors, and of outgoing executive director Luke Muehlhauser.</p>\n<p>MIRI has improved greatly under Luke\u2019s guidance these last few years, and I\u2019m honored to have the opportunity to continue that trend. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in conversation with Luke over the past few weeks, and he\u2019ll remain a close advisor going forward. He and the management team have spent the last year or so really tightening up the day-to-day operations at MIRI, and I\u2019m excited about all the opportunities we have open to us now.</p>\n<p>The last year has been pretty incredible. Discussion of long-term AI risks and benefits has finally hit the mainstream, thanks to the success of Bostrom\u2019s\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies\">Superintelligence</a></em>\u00a0and FLI\u2019s Puerto Rico conference, and due in no small part to years of movement-building and effort made possible by MIRI\u2019s supporters. Over the last year, I\u2019ve forged close connections with our friends at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">Future of Humanity Institute</a>, the\u00a0<a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/\">Future of Life Institute</a>, and the\u00a0<a href=\"http://cser.org/\">Centre for the Study of Existential Risk</a>, as well as with a number of industry teams and academic groups who are focused on long-term AI research. I\u2019m looking forward to our continued participation in the global conversation about the future of AI. These are exciting times in our field, and MIRI is well-poised to grow and expand. Indeed, one of my top priorities as executive director is to grow the research team.</p>\n<p>That project is already well under way. I\u2019m pleased to announce that Jessica Taylor has accepted a full-time position as a MIRI researcher starting in August 2015. We are also hosting a series of summer workshops focused on various technical AI alignment problems, the second of which is just now concluding. Additionally, we are working with the\u00a0<a href=\"http://rationality.org/\">Center for Applied Rationality</a>\u00a0to put on a\u00a0<a href=\"http://rationality.org/miri-summer-fellows-2015/\">summer fellows program</a>designed for people interested in gaining the skills needed for research in the field of AI alignment.</p>\n<p>I want to take a moment to extend my heartfelt thanks to all those supporters of MIRI who have brought us to where we are today: We have a slew of opportunities before us, and it\u2019s all thanks to your effort and support these past years. MIRI couldn\u2019t have made it as far as it has without you. Exciting times are ahead, and your continued support will allow us to grow quickly and pursue all the opportunities that the last year opened up.</p>\n<p>Finally, in case you want to get to know me a little better, I\u2019ll be answering questions on the\u00a0<a href=\"/\">effective altruism forum</a>\u00a0at 3PM Pacific time on Thursday June 11<span>th</span>.</p>\n<p>Onwards,</p>\n<p>Nate</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>Depending on what you want to ask Nate, you might be interested in:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/jl3/on_saving_the_world/\">On saving the world</a>, which describes some of\u00a0Nate's backstory</span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2013/06/05/friendly-ai-research-as-effective-altruism/\">MIRI and effective altruism</a>\u00a0<span>by Luke\u00a0Muehlhauser, which describes how MIRI's work relates to effective altruism.</span></li>\n<li><span><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lo6/miris_technical_agenda_an_annotated_bibliography/\">MIRI's technical agenda</a>, which details MIRI's research plans.</span></li>\n</ul></div></div>"},

{"date": "9th Mar 2015", "title": "Bitton's 3-month Personal Review", "author": "Bitton", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><span>This post is inspired by Peter Hurford's <a href=\"/ea/d9/peters_personal_review_for_octdec_2014/\">3-month reviews</a>. Although I don't spend as much time on direct EA work as Peter does, I think people here might find this interesting as a case study of the usefulness of productivity techniques and rigorous organization on personal effectiveness. My feeling is that this 3 month period may well have been the most successful 3 months of my life in terms of career progress, personal development, wellbeing, and learning.</span></p>\n<p><span>Three months ago I started using a number of productivity apps and becoming more organized. Of these changes, the most important was my use of the app Toggl. With Toggl, I tracked everything that I did, every day. It took a couple of days to get the hang of but I quickly learned to start and stop my timer throughout the day with pretty little effort.</span></p>\n<p><span> Those first couple of days, I struggled because I was being too specific. I was naming activities things like \"helping [my roommate] write her email to quit her job\" and \"Working on my Response to Gwern blog post.\" But 3 months of specific activities like that would be a nightmare to sort through afterward. So I chose set categories to place every activity into.</span></p>\n<p><span> My categories were:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Sleep</span></li>\n<li><span>Social</span></li>\n<li><span>Internet</span></li>\n<li><span>Food</span></li>\n<li><span>Transport</span></li>\n<li><span>Exercise</span></li>\n<li><span>Meditation</span></li>\n<li><span>Web Development</span></li>\n<li><span>Economics</span></li>\n<li><span>Meta</span></li>\n<li><span>Career</span></li>\n<li><span>Day Job</span></li>\n<li><span>Housework</span></li>\n<li><span>Shopping</span></li>\n<li><span>Reading</span></li>\n<li><span>Writing</span></li>\n<li><span>Creative Writing</span></li>\n<li><span>Art</span></li>\n<li><span>Break</span></li>\n<li><span>Other</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Many of these categories were additions that I only added in middle of this period.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><strong>Sleep</strong>: Time spent sleeping, including time where I'm lying in my bed waiting to fall asleep and time where I've just woken up but haven't got out of bed or started doing anything yet.</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Social</strong>: Everything that I do with another person for no reason other than to hang out or have fun.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Internet</strong>: \"Internet\" includes mostly unproductive time spent on Facebook, watching YouTube videos, or going on other websites such as this forum.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Food</strong>: Includes cooking, eating, and being at a restaurant. Any time spent not doing other things because I have to eat.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Transport</strong>: Time spent biking, walking from place to place, on public transit, and on the bus between Montreal and Toronto.\u00a0I often switch to \"Transport\" a couple of minutes before or after I've actually left or arrived somewhere, meaning that putting my shoes and coat on is usually considered \"Transport\" rather than \"Other.\"</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Exercise</strong>: Self-explanatory. I was fortunate enough to have a slack retail job that allowed me to do copious amounts of sit ups while the store was empty. In the past couple of weeks, my routine has broken because I now have a different job and need to leave the house earlier. This period is the longest I\u2019ve ever been able to sustain a personal exercise routine.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Meditation</strong>: Ten minutes a day, first thing in the morning using Headspace until my free trial ran out (since then I've changed sites a lot). I never noticed any direct benefits from this but it was useful for contributing to my morning victory spiral. I\u2019ve also only done 13 hours.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong> Web Development</strong>: One day, after finishing all my daily goals by ~4pm, I decided to start something new. I did the HTML &amp; CSS tutorials on Codecademy, Khan Academy, Shay Howe, and used a lot of other online resources to teach myself basic web development. After about a week of tutorials, I began giving myself challenges such as to code a perfect replica of my resume or a perfect replica of a specific website. The \"Web Development\" category includes any time I spent learning web development, whether I was doing a tutorial, working on a project, or looking up the answer to a question online.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Economics</strong>: On a whim, I decided to take the Khan Academy Microeconomics course. I went through about 55 videos in a couple of weeks and then found it difficult to continue. This is a pretty low priority for me but there were a couple of weeks of enthusiasm where I was teaching myself basic economics for an hour or two a night.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Meta</strong>: Shortly after beginning with Toggl, I began experimenting with other productivity apps. A lot of my time was spent reading lists of the most useful apps, writing myself lists for Workflowy, writing reminders in Evernote, monitoring my Beeminder, creating myself a homepage of my useful links, etc. All of this stuff I count as \"Meta\" because I'm spending my time monitoring my own productivity. For the record, many apps I didn't find useful. In particular, mood and sleep tracking apps did nothing for me.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Career</strong>: Job hunting, sending emails for informational interviews, doing informational and job interviews, researching for my career, updating my cover letter and resume, etc. In order to prepare myself for a job interview at an animation studio, I watched kids TV shows every morning in my \"Career\" time.</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Day Job</strong>: Time spent at my day job. I started off by counting all my time spent at work, thinking that it would be awkward to Toggl in front of customers and my boss. Eventually, I realized how much I could get done while at work and so I began using \"Day Job\" to refer only to actual work and to time spent at work doing nothing else. On the job, I did a lot of exercise, reading, and taught myself web development. At my new job, I don\u2019t have time to fool around, so I\u2019m on \u201cDay Job\u201d for the full 10+ hours barring (sometimes) lunch.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong> Housework</strong>: Washing dishes, sweeping the floor, taking out the trash. Mostly dishes.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Shopping</strong>: Shopping for groceries, gifts, clothes, plants, loitering in stores and malls, etc.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Reading</strong>: This one is a bit of judgment call. Just about whenever I'm on the Internet, I'm reading but I'm not necessarily in the \"Reading\" category. I'm \"Reading\" when I'm reading academic articles or books.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Writing</strong>: This includes my book summaries, blog posts, and posts on the EA Forum. It does not include creative writing, emails, or social media.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong> Creative Writing</strong>: I write little short pieces of Creative Writing. For 2-3 weeks, I included this in \"Art\".</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Art</strong>: Includes reading fiction, watching movies, listening to music, etc. Of course, if I listen to music while job hunting, that only gets credited as \"Career.\"</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Break</strong>: Little breaks from working. I mainly use this category when I'm using the Pomodoro technique.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Other</strong>: Mostly time spent in the bathroom: brushing teeth, showering, etc. Also, some random, unusual stuff: For Christmas, I was taking care of a friend's cat, so each night I spent about 30 minutes of \"Other\" time at their condo feeding and playing with it.</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>My stats:</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Art</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>2.77%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>51:06:48</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Break</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0.21%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>3:48:53</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Career</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>2.6%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>47:58:39</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Creative Writing</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0.35%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>6:27:50</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Day Job</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>16.81%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>310:00:52</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Economics</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0.94%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>17:17:32</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Exercise</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0.95%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>17:31:22</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Food</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>2.29%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>42:14:29</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Housework</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0.99%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>18:19:23</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Internet</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>9.17%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>169:07:51</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Meditation</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0.74%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>13:39:42</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Meta</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>1.4%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>25:50:55</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Other</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>5.25%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>96:52:40</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Reading</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>2.45%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>45:10:01</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Shopping</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0.5%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>9:09:44</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Sleep</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>35.89%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>661:54:07</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Social</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>6.95%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>128:08:39</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Transport</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>4.47%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>82:20:41</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Web Development</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>2.37%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>43:44:08</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Writing</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>3.03%</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>55:51:19</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Sources of inaccuracy</strong>:</span></p>\n<p><span>Sometimes things are difficult to categorize. When I go to a restaurant with my friend, is that \"Social\" or \"Food?\" When I talk to my friend on Facebook, is it \"Social\" or \"Internet?\" If I watch a stand up comedy act with a friend is that \"Social\" or \"Art?\" When I wanted to do research for a job interview at an animation studio, I was waking up an hour early each morning to watch kids TV shows. I categorized this as \"Career\" but it could as easily have been categorized as \"Art.\"</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Also, I often do two things at once. For the first of these three months, I had a day job that allowed me to \"slack off\" and be actually productive on the job. So whenever I was without supervision I'd get some \"Reading,\" \"Writing,\" and \"Meta\" stuff done - and yet it was all categorized as \"Day Job.\" Sometimes I'd exercise while listening to the kids shows and yet this all took place in a \"Career\" chunk of time.</span></p>\n<p><span>For the past 5 days, my Toggl app has been broken on my phone. As a result, I could only update my time tracker on my laptop and thus had to do some post hoc guesstimation.</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Finally, little things tend to get overlooked. When I stop my timer and then start a new act, there's usually a few seconds or minutes that get lost in the mix. Suppose I'm in \"Internet\" mode, going through my favourite websites and then I find something really interesting, which leads me to click on something else, which leads me to click on something else. Before I know it, I've transferred over into \"Reading\" but I'm not going to switch from \"Internet\" into \"Reading\" if I'm just reading one blog post. I have to read for a while before I go \"okay, it now seems unfair to call this 'Internet,' it's time to toggle.\" So there are these little cracks in between toggles and it's easy to lose little \"Breaks\" and \"Others\" and \"Readings\" in those cracks. But with activities that you only do for a few minutes a day, it's important not to lose those few minutes a day in the cracks.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><strong>Lessons Learned</strong>:</span></p>\n<p><span>Looking at these stats, I don\u2019t feel like I see much about myself that I didn\u2019t already know. I don\u2019t get much out of scrutinizing my time use. Rather, I benefited from the <em>process</em> of organizing and monitoring myself.</span></p>\n<p><span>For instance, I quickly realized how much I can get done in a day. Once I started setting myself daily goals, I found that I could usually complete them with several hours left to spare. That's why early in this project, I realized that I could fit web development into my schedule and work on it every day.</span></p>\n<p><span> This process has made me really good at starting new habits immediately. After starting the Codecademy tutorial on a whim one night, I continued to teach myself HTML &amp; CSS every day from then on, for at least an hour a day, with few exceptions. When I decided to meditate for 10 minutes each day, I started and then never missed a day. When I decided to watch kids TV shows in order to prepare for my job interview, I scheduled it into my morning routine and watched 1 or 2 new shows each day. Same for when I decided to do 50 sit-ups and push-ups each morning as soon as I get out of bed. And then when I decided to do 500+ sit-ups every day while at work. And then when my sister showed me the posture exercises she does. I got a bit of reading done every day. I started about 6 new apps and routines within the first couple of days and stuck to all of them without difficulty. About 3 weeks later, I created myself a budget and started updating it every single day with the amount of money I've spent. At one point, to prepare for my job interview, I began doing a mock expense report of my trip to Montreal and I updated that every day as well.</span></p>\n<p><span> In the past three months, I have barely had any bad moods at all and the ones I did have were very brief (~1-5 minutes). Mostly, I felt very excited and in control.</span></p>\n<p><span>Most of my bad moods are related to attending social events that I know I don\u2019t belong at. I've noticed over these three months that most of the social activity I do is against my own will and interests. When people ask me to be social, I usually say yes even though I have other things I'd like to get done in that time. One of my goals for the next three months is to say no to social requests more often. Now that I'm organized and on track, the randomness of other people's goals and hang out plans just feels like a distraction. Many of the dollars I've spent eating out can be directly attributed to somebody else asking me if I want to go out with them and me agreeing even though I know it's not a good way to spend my money or a productive way to spend my time. I also have this weird thing where I genuinely have more fun on the job than I do while \u201chaving fun\u201d.</span></p>\n<p><span>The first thing I noticed about using Toggl is how aware it made me of the passage of time. I could constantly feel a ticking clock in the back of my head and that made it much more difficult to waste long hours of time. I had a constant sense of urgency. This was bolstered by all the other techniques I was using \u2013 Pomodoro, Workflowy, HabitRPG, Evernote, Beeminder \u2013 they create a self-reinforcing system. Skipping my morning workout is really unappealing when I know that that\u2019s what comes before meditation in my morning routine. And I don\u2019t give myself HabitRPG points until I\u2019ve completed my morning routine. And I won\u2019t be able to cross these off my Workflowy list of daily goals.</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Finally, I was surprised at how helpful rigorous organization was to me. I was initially skeptical of quantified self stuff but I noticed a very immediate and drastic difference in my productivity and mood as soon as I started. I\u2019ve recently stopped doing most of these techniques because I got a new job that has completely changed my routine and I haven\u2019t yet been able to adjust. Maybe I will never be able to string together more than a couple of consecutive months of enthusiasm but even a couple of months like this a year is great. These may have been the 3 most successful months of my life.</span></p>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Career Progress</strong>:</span></p>\n<p><span>In these 3 months, I saw significant career progress, going from unemployed to landing my first \u201creal\u201d job. I began this experiment shortly after completing work on a feature film and with no leads for future work. From there, I got a retail job in a furniture store. As far as retail jobs go, it was pretty good. I was left completely unattended and could use the time to read, practice web development, write fiction, and do 500 sit ups per shift. I stayed there for 6 weeks until I quit, knowing that I had several good leads for jobs in my field.</span></p>\n<p><span>I spent one week doing job interviews, informational interviews, and research. The informational interview I did this week was one of the most productive I\u2019d ever done (out of ~20) and I apparently only missed out on the job I interviewed for because the hiring had been rescheduled to the summer.</span></p>\n<p><span>I spent a second week writing essays for lazy college kids. In that work week, I churned out ~50 pages on various boring topics and earned the same money as I would have received at my retail job in, at most, the same number of hours worked.</span></p>\n<p><span>Finally, I was granted a one-week tryout shift as an executive assistant at an animation studio that creates kids TV shows. I have now finished my third week and, although I\u2019ve yet to sign a contract, I get the feeling that I\u2019m here to stay. This is big for me because it\u2019s my first \u201creal\u201d job that pays a real salary and that keeps me hired for (hopefully) longer than a couple of months.</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>In my first three weeks, I\u2019ve already learned a lot about the job, the office, the industry, and have been given an unusually good opportunity to improve my organizational skills. To provide some context, my job is basically The Devil Wears Prada and involves keeping the President and VP of a 250+ employee company prepared and on schedule. The job is so fast-paced and high pressure that I often ride an adrenaline rush from the start to the end of my shift.</span></p>\n<p><span>During these 3 months, I also continued talking to a writer-director about producing his short film. Although I\u2019ve been a \u201cproduction coordinator\u201d and a \u201cproduction manager\u201d, I\u2019ve never properly \u201cproduced\u201d anything aside from my own crappy, student work so this is a good opportunity for me. It\u2019s paid, a good learning experience, a solid addition to my resume, and a chance for me to stay involved in production even while working as an executive assistant.</span></p>\n<p><span>I also wrote some basic, introductory posts for Effective Altruism Switzerland in this time, expanding the list of EA organizations I\u2019ve worked with. I think I may be on the verge of expanding that list further.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Questions, comments?</span></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "25th Mar 2015", "title": "Criminal Justice Reform: DEA enforcement incentives?", "author": "RomeoStevens", "num_comments": "1 comment", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>GiveWell is currently investigating criminal justice reform as an area of potentially effective giving. I just wanted to raise one particular issue for discussion and find out whether anyone else has investigated it.</p>\n<p>The War on Drugs continues despite a tide of public sentiment slowly rising against it. Part of the reason is potentially special interest groups who stand to lose a lot of money if things change. This includes the Prison Guard Union and Private Prison Corporations who fight to keep tough drug sentencing on the books, as well as Police Unions who rely on the WoD for a large part of their budget. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/instituteforjustice/2015/03/19/the-dea-is-seizing-cash-without-warrants-in-its-version-of-stop-and-frisk/\">The DEA in particular has been incentivized by its ability to seize large amounts of cash without due process</a>.</p>\n<p>There is already some momentum generated by the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEpZWGgJks\">John Oliver piece on this subject</a>.\u00a0The public is easily able to understand the concept of a perverse incentive in this situation because it is so transparent. Police agencies also might find it hard to mount resistance against changing this, but I don't know the shape of current efforts here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why this might be of interest to EAs:</p>\n<p>Normally these sorts of freedom-for-first-worlders ideas would not be very interesting from an EA perspective. I think this is potentially different because of the downstream effects. Incentives to continue the WoD lessons significantly -&gt; Decriminalization -&gt; Demand side collapse for the support network for drug cartels whom murder many people in Latin America and seriously undermine the QoL for many others.</p>\n<p>Yes, the links in this chain are some pretty big jumps and might not happen. But if they are possible AND changing these incentives turn out to be relatively cheap it could be worth it.</p></div></div>"},

I then talk about the standard income measure of extreme poverty ($1.90/day - recently updated by the World Bank) and how it compares to relative poverty in the rich world. I devote the last portion to arguing that one should not value one's compatriots over others; this is discrimination on the basis of nationality and is similar to discrimination on the basis of race.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I spent about a month, full-time, making this video. (I'm new to making videos, so that partly explains why I am so slow. But also I wanted to make it as good as possible.) I've tried to make it as engaging and interesting as possible. I also tried to include what I thought were the most important points, while still keeping the video at a reasonable length.</p>\n<p><strong>Please take a look and suggest improvements. And please share it too if you think it's worth sharing!</strong> <strong>Thank you!!</strong></p>\n<p>I think social media and YouTube videos like this are the way to go in spreading the EA message. My video is obviously not good enough to go viral \u00e0 la Gangnam Style or Harlem Shake, though with your help, it can hopefully be shared with some non-trivial fraction of the world's population. Also given enough suggestions for improvements I may also try to make a better video. Or perhaps someone with better video-making talents can do so, or collaborate with me to make a better video. Feel free to email me at EconCow[at]gmail[dot]com.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Full disclosure: I also have the selfish ulterior motive of wanting  to promote my new educational YouTube channel on economics. But in my  own defense, I am making this YouTube channel because I think online  education is the future, which is why I'm trying my hand at this. I think online education will be how we can give universal, free, and  excellent education to the entire world, including the world's least  well-off. So my career choice is to a great extent influenced by Effective Altruism.)</p></div></div>"},

For total utilitarianism this axiom is: \"It is good for a SEP with positive utility to occur if it doesn't affect anything else\". This seems to be one of the most basic assumptions that one could choose to start with - it's practically equivalent to \"It is good when good things occur\". However, if it is true, then average utilitarianism is false, as a positive, but low utility SEP may bring the average utility down. It also leads to the sadistic conclusion, that if a large number of SEPs involve negative utility, we should add a SEP who suffers less over adding no-one. Total utilitarianism does lead to the\u00a0<a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/\">repugnant conclusion</a>, but contrary to perceptions, near zero, but still positive utility\u00a0is not a state of terrible suffering like most people imagine. Instead, it is by definition a life that is still good and worth living overall.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, average utilitarianism starts from its own \"obviously true\" axiom, that we should maximise the average expected utility for each person independent of the total utility. We note that average utilitarianism depends on a statement about aggregations (expected utility), while total utilitarianism depends on a statement about an individual occurrence that doesn't interact with any other SEPs. Given the complexities with aggregating utility, we should be more inclined towards trusting the statement about individual occurrences, then the one about a complex aggregate. This is far from conclusive, but I still believe that this is a useful exercise.</p>\n<p>So why is average utilitarianism flawed? The strongest argument for average utilitarianism is the aforementioned \"obviously true\" assumption that we should maximise expected utility. Accepting this assumption would reduce the situation as follows:</p>\n<p>Original situation -&gt; expected utility</p>\n<p>Given that we already exist, it is natural for us really want the average expected utility to be high and for us to want to preference it over increasing the population seeing as not existing is not inherently negative. However, while not existing is not negative in the absolute sense, it is still negative in the relative sense due to opportunity cost. It is plausibly good for more happy people to exist, so reducing the situation as we did above discards important information without justification. Another way of stating the situation is as follows: While it may be intuitive to reduce population ethics to a single lottery, this is incorrect; instead, it can only be reduced to n repeated lotteries, where n is the number of people<strong>.</strong>\u00a0This situations can be represented as followed:</p>\n<p>Original situation -&gt; (expected utility, number of SEPs)</p>\n<p>Since this is a tuple, it doesn't provide an automatic ranking for situations, but instead needs to be subject to another transformation before this can occur. It is now clear that the first model assumed away the possible importance of the number of SEPs without justification and therefore assumed its conclusion. Since the strongest argument for average utilitarianism is invalid, the question is what other reasons are there for believing in average utilitarianism? As we have already noted, the repugnant conclusion is much less repugnant than it is generally perceived. This leaves us with very little in the way of logical reasons to believe in average utilitarianism. On the other hand, as already discussed, there are very good reasons for believing in total utilitarianism, or at least something much closer to total utilitarianism than average utilitarianism.</p>\n<p>I made this argument using SEPs for simplicity, but there's no reason why the same result shouldn't also apply to complete people. I'll also note that according to the <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/#IntNewWayAggWelMeaVal\">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>, average utilitarianism hasn't gained much favour within the philosophical literature. One of the most common counter-arguments is called the sadistic conclusion, sadly I couldn't find a good link for explaining this, so I'll leave you to Google it yourself.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/n3q/in_favour_of_total_utilitarianism_over_average/\">Cross-posted to Less Wrong</a></p></div></div>"},

{"date": "20th Sep 2015", "title": "Charities I Would Like to See", "author": "MichaelDickens", "num_comments": "39 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em>Cross-posted to <a href=\"http://mdickens.me/2015/09/12/charities_i_would_like_to_see/\">my blog</a>.</em></p>\n<p>There are a few cause areas that are plausibly highly effective, but as far as I know, no one is working on them. If there existed a charity working on one of these problems, I might consider donating to it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Happy_Animal_Farm\">Happy Animal Farm</h2>\n<p>The closest thing we can make to universal eudaimonia with current technology is a farm of many small animals that are made as happy as possible. Presumably the animals are cared for by people who know a lot about their psychology and welfare and can make sure they\u2019re happy. One plausible species choice is rats, because rats are small (and therefore easy to take care of and don\u2019t consume a lot of resources), definitively sentient, and we have a reasonable idea of how to make them happy.</p>\n<p>I am not aware of any public discussion on this subject, so I will perform a quick ad-hoc effectiveness estimate.</p>\n<p>(Most of the figures below come from a personal communication with Emily Cutts Worthington, who is more knowledgeable about taking care of rats than I am. These figures are not robust but are based on her best guesses.)</p>\n<p>A rat curator working a few hours a week can probably support 100 happy rats. I have a lot of uncertainty about how brain size affects sentience, but say a happy rat is half as happy as a happy human. Suppose the rats are euthanized when their health starts to deteriorate, so they get close to 1 QALY per year. This would cost about $5 per rat per month plus an opportunity cost of maybe $500 per month for the time spent, which works out to another $5 per rat per month. Thus creating 1 rat QALY costs $120 per year, which is $240 per human QALY per year.</p>\n<p>Deworming treatments cost about <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming/cost-effectiveness#Findings\">$30 per DALY</a>. Thus a rat farm looks like a fairly expensive way of producing utility. It may be possible to decrease costs by scaling up the rat farm operation, but it would have to be about an order of magnitude cheaper to rival deworming treatments.</p>\n<p>This is just a rough back-of-the-envelope calculation so it should not be taken literally, but I\u2019m still surprised by how cost-inefficient this looks. I expected rat farms to be highly cost-effective based on the fact that most people don\u2019t care about rats, and generally the less people care about some group, the easier it is to help that group. (It\u2019s easier to help developing-world humans than developed-world humans, and easier still to help factory-farmed animals.) Again, I could be completely wrong about these calculations, but rat farms look less promising than I had expected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Humane_Insecticides\">Humane Insecticides</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/humane-insecticides/\">http://reducing-suffering.org/humane-insecticides/</a></p>\n<p>I know very little about humane insecticides but it\u2019s a cause that\u2019s plausibly highly cost-effective and virtually no one is working on it. I\u2019m inclined to want to focus more on high-learning-value or far-future interventions; supporting humane insecticides probably only has short-term effects (albeit extremely large ones). But the overwhelming importance of reducing insect suffering (if insects feel pain, which seems sufficiently likely to be a concern) and the extreme neglectedness of this cause could possibly make it the best thing to work on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"High_Leverage_Values_Spreading\">High-Leverage Values Spreading</h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://mdickens.me/2015/09/10/on_values_spreading/\">On Values Spreading</a>, I discuss the possibility of focusing values-spreading efforts on high-leverage individuals:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Probably, some sorts of values spreading matter much, much more than others. Perhaps convincing AI researchers to care more about non-human animals could substantially increase the probability that a superintelligent AI will also care about animals. This could be highly impactful and may even be the most effective thing to do right now. (I am much more willing to consider donating to MIRI now that its executive director values non-human animals.) I don\u2019t see anyone doing this, and if I did, I would want to see evidence that they were doing a good job; but this would plausibly be a highly effective intervention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019d like to see an organization that focuses specifically on seeking out and implementing extremely high-leverage values spreading interventions. Perhaps this could mean trying to persuade AI researchers or geoengineering researchers to care about non-human animals\u2013the results of their research could have drastic effects on animals and we want to make sure those effects are positive. I\u2019m sure there are other high-leverage values spreading interventions that no one is currently doing (targeting high-impact researchers is just the first one I came up with off the top of my head); a dedicated organization could explore this space and try to find other highly effective strategies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Promoting_Universal_Eudaimonia\">Promoting Universal Eudaimonia</h2>\n<p>Right now, shockingly few people are concerned with filling the universe with tiny beings whose minds are specifically geared toward feeling as much pure happiness as possible. I\u2019d like to see more efforts to promote this outcome. Maybe the best way to do this is to start a Pay David Pearce to Do Whatever He Wants Fund, but I don\u2019t know if David Pearce is funding constrained.</p></div></div>"}
