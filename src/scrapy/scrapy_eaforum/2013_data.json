A lot of decisions started to look very starkly wrong.</p><p>I remember telling my dad that I had decided it would be immoral for me to have children, because they would take too much of my time and money away from better causes. \u201cIt doesn't sound like this lifestyle is going to make you happy,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cMy happiness is not the point,\u201d I told him.</p><p>A few years later, I was deeply bitter about the decision. I had always wanted and intended to be a parent, and I felt thwarted. It was making me sick and miserable. I looked at the rest of my life as more of an obligation than a joy.</p><p>So my husband and I decided that it wasn't worth having a breakdown over. We decided to set aside enough for our personal spending that we could reasonably afford to raise a child. Looking back at my journal entries from before and after the decision, I'm struck by how much difference it made in my outlook. Immediately after we gave ourselves permission to be parents, I was excited about the future again. I don't know if or when we'll actually have a kid, but just the possibility helps me feel things will be all right. And I suspect that feeling of satisfaction with my own life lets me be more help to the world than I would have as a broken-down altruist.</p><p>I've attended Quaker meeting for the last ten years. The founder, George Fox, gave his followers this advice in 1658: \u201cBe patterns, be examples in all countries, places, islands, nations wherever you come; that your carriage and life may preach among all sorts of people, and to them; then you will come to walk cheerfully over the world, answering that of God in everyone; whereby in them you may be a blessing.\u201d</p><p>Quakers have tended to emphasize the part about \u201cthat of God in everyone,\u201d with its implication about equality: how can it be right to keep slaves, for example, if the slave has an element of the divine in her?</p><p>But my favorite part is that word \u201ccheerfully.\u201d Fox was a man who had been jailed and beaten for his religious beliefs \u2013 surely he had a right to be bitter. Quakerism later developed a stern and dour style, but George Fox was not about that.</p><p>Some things I can do cheerfully. It turns out that giving up children was not one of them. Other people would have no problem giving up parenthood, but I suspect that everyone has something that would cause an inordinate amount of pain to sacrifice.</p><p>So test your boundaries, and see what changes you can make that will help others without costing you too dearly. But when you find that something is making you bitter, stop. Effective altruism is not about driving yourself to a breakdown. We don't need people making sacrifices that leave them drained and miserable. We need people who can walk cheerfully over the world, or at least do their damnedest.</p></div></div>"},

Let me explain:</p>\n<p>The Why is to make the world as good a place as it can possibly be. Rather than merely aiming to make the world better than when we found it \u2014 \"to make <strong>a</strong> difference\" \u2014 we want to make <strong>the most</strong> difference. So, for example, rather than simply trying to find a development charity that \u201cdoes good work\u201d, Giving What We Can seeks to find those charities that do the very most to help people in developing countries with every pound or dollar they receive. In general, we seek out those activities that will do the most good with our time or money.</p>\n<p>The How \u2014 how to find those activities that do the most good \u2014 is by using good evidence and good reasoning. Where a question concerns a matter of fact, we try to find the best empirical evidence that is relevant to that question. (An anecdote is bad, a double-blind randomized controlled trial is better, a well-performed meta-analysis is best.) Where a question concerns values, we use clear arguments, rational reflection, and the latest insights from ethics, economics, and psychology to help us come to the right view. So, for example, rather than going with feel-good slogans like \u201cfollow your passion\u201d, or passing on anecdotes about specific people, at 80,000 Hours we\u2019re busy digging into all the available academic research related to doing good through your career, and getting clear, conceptually, on what making a difference involves.</p>\n<p>From these two ideas, the What follows. Effective altruists currently tend to think that the most important causes to focus on are global poverty, factory farming, and the long-term future of life on Earth. I'll talk more about the reasons why these are generally thought to be the highest-impact cause areas in later posts, but in each case, the reasoning is that the stakes are very high, and there is the potential to make a lot of progress. Right now, within the <a href=\"http://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">Centre for Effective Altruism</a>, the What consists of the organisations listed to the right: organisations that, for example, promote donating a good chunk of one's income to the causes that most effectively fight global poverty (<a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com/\">The Life You Can Save</a>); or that advise individuals on which careers enable them to have the greatest positive impact (<a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a>); or that try to figure out how best to improve animal welfare (<a href=\"http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/\">Effective Animal Activism</a>). But these activities are just our current best guesses. If we had good evidence or arguments that showed that we could do more good by doing something else, then we'd do that instead.</p>\n<p>Part of\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/\">Introduction to Effective Altruism</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/\"></a><span>Previous:</span><span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"/ea/6v/scope_insensitivity/\">Scope Insensitivity</a><span>\u00a0</span><span>\u2022 Next:</span><span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"/ea/4r/cheerfully/\">Cheerfully</a></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "5th Nov 2013", "title": "A Long-run perspective on strategic cause selection and philanthropy", "author": "Carl_Shulman", "num_comments": "29 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em><strong>Co-written by Nick Beckstead and Carl Shulman</strong></em>\n</p><h2 id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</h2>\nA philanthropist who will remain anonymous recently asked us about what we would do if we didn\u2019t face financial constraints. We gave a detailed answer that we thought we might as well share with others, who may also find our perspective interesting. We gave the answer largely in hope of creating some interest in our way of thinking about philanthropy and some of the causes that we find interesting for further investigation, and because we thought the answer would be fruitful for conversation.\n<h2 id=\"Our_honest_answer_to_your_question\">Our honest answer to your question</h2>\nOur honest answer to your question is that we would systematically examine a wide variety of causes and opportunities with the intention of identifying the ones which could use additional money and talent to produce the best long-run outcomes. This would look a lot like setting up a major foundation--which is unsurprising, given that many people in this situation do set up foundations--so we will concentrate on the distinguishing or less typical features of our approach:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Unlike many foundations, we would place a great deal of emphasis on selecting the highest impact program areas, rather than selecting program areas for other reasons and working hardest to find the best opportunities within those areas. Like <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/05/02/strategic-cause-selection/\">GiveWell</a>, we believe that the choice of program areas may be one of the most important decisions a major philanthropist makes and is consistently underemphasized.</li>\n\t<li>We would invest heavily in learning, funding systematic examination of the spectrum of opportunities, and the transparent publication of our process and findings.</li>\n\t<li>In addition to sharing information about giving opportunities, we would share detailed information about talent gaps, encouraging people with the right abilities to seek out opportunities in promising areas that are constrained by people rather than money.</li>\n\t<li>We would measure impact primarily in terms of very long-run positive consequences for humanity, as outlined in <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/nbeckstead/research\">Nick\u2019s PhD thesis</a>.</li>\n\t<li>We would be skeptical of our intuitions, and check them through such means as external review, the collection of track records for our predictions, structured evaluations, and the use of simple and sophisticated methods of aggregating and improving on expert opinion (e.g. the forecasting training and aggregation methods developed by Philip Tetlock, calibration training, prediction markets, and anonymous surveys of appropriate experts).</li>\n</ol>\nWe understand that you probably aren\u2019t contacting us about setting up a foundation, though you might be interested in hearing more about the approach and assumptions above, so we\u2019ll say a few things about how we would go about strategically selecting causes, and our leading hypotheses about which causes are most promising to investigate further.<p></p><p>Briefly,\n</p><ol>\n\t<li><strong>We believe that maximizing good accomplished largely reduces to doing what is best in terms of very long-run outcomes for humanity.</strong> We think this has significant practical implications when making trade-offs between short-term welfare and the broad functioning of society, our ability to face major global challenges and opportunities, and increasing society\u2019s resilience to global catastrophes.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Five causes we are interested in investigating first include immigration reform, methods for improved forecasting, an area we call \u201cphilanthropic infrastructure,\u201d catastrophic risks to humanity, and research integrity.</strong> These would be areas for investigation and experimentation, and we would pursue them in the short run primarily for the sake of gaining information about how attractive they are in comparison with other areas. There many other causes we would like to investigate early on, and would begin investigating those causes less deeply and in parallel with our investigations of the causes we are most enthusiastic about. We\u2019d be happy to discuss the other causes with you as well.</li>\n</ol>\nWe elaborate on these ideas below.\n<h2 id=\"Is_the_long_run_actionable_in_the_short_run_\">Is the long run actionable in the short run?</h2>\nAs just mentioned, we believe that maximizing good accomplished largely reduces to doing what is best in terms of very long-run outcomes for humanity, and that this has strategic implications for people aiming to maximize good accomplished with their resources. We think these implications are significant when choosing between causes or program areas, and less significant when comparing opportunities within program areas.<p></p><p>There is a lot of detail behind this perspective and it is hard to summarize briefly. But here is an attempt to quickly explain our reasoning:\n</p><ol>\n\t<li>We think humanity has a reasonable probability of lasting a very long time, becoming very large, and/or eventually enjoying a very high quality of life. This could happen through radical (or even moderate) technological change, if industrial civilization persists as long as agriculture has persisted (though upper limits for life on Earth are around a billion years), or if future generations colonize other regions of space. Though we wouldn\u2019t bet on very specific details, we think some of these possibilities have a reasonable probability of occurring.</li>\n\t<li>Because of this, we think that, from an impartial perspective, almost all of the potential good we can accomplish comes through influencing very long-run outcomes for humanity.</li>\n\t<li>We believe long-run outcomes may be highly sensitive to how well humanity handles key challenges and opportunities, especially challenges from new technology, in the next hundred years or so.</li>\n\t<li>We believe that (especially with substantial resources) we could have small but significant positive impacts on how effectively we face these challenges and opportunities, and thereby affect expected long-run outcomes for humanity.</li>\n\t<li>We could face these challenges and opportunities more effectively by preparing for specific challenges and opportunities (such as nuclear security and climate change in the past and present, and advances in synthetic biology and artificial intelligence in the future), or by enhancing humanity\u2019s general capacities to deal with these challenges and opportunities when we face them (through higher rates of economic growth, improved political coordination, improved use of information and decision-making for individuals and groups, and increases in education and human capital).</li>\n</ol>\n\u00a0<p></p><p>We believe that this perspective diverges from the recommendations of a more short-run focus in a few ways.</p><p>First, when we consider attempts to prepare for global challenges and opportunities in general, we weigh such factors as economic output, log incomes, education, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), scientific progress, and governance quality differently than if we would if we put less emphasis on long-run outcomes for humanity. In particular, a more short-term focus would lead to a much stronger emphasis on QALYs and log incomes, which we suspect could be purchased more cheaply through interventions targeting people in developing countries, e.g. through public health or more open migration. Attending to long-run impacts creates a closer contest between such interventions and those which increase economic output or institutional quality (and thus the quality of our response to future challenges and opportunities). \u00a0Our perspective would place an especially high premium on intermediate goals such as the quality of forecasting and the transmission of scientific knowledge to policy makers, which are disproportionately helpful for navigating global challenges and opportunities.</p><p>Second, when there are opportunities for identifying specific major challenges or opportunities for affecting long-run outcomes for humanity, our perspective favors treating these challenges and opportunities with the utmost seriousness. We believe that reducing the risk of catastrophes with the potential to destroy humanity--which we call \u201cglobal catastrophic risks\u201d or sometimes \u201c<a href=\"http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdf\">existential risks</a>\u201d--has an unusually clear and positive connection with long-run outcomes, and this is a reason we are unusually interested in problems in this area.</p><p>Third, the long-run perspective values resilience against permanent disruption or worsening of civilization over and above resilience to short-term catastrophe. From a long-run perspective, there is an enormous difference between a collapse of civilization followed by eventual recovery, versus a permanent collapse of civilization. This point has been made by philosophers like Derek Parfit (very memorably at the end of his book Reasons and Persons) and Peter Singer (in a <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/preventing-human-extinction\">short piece</a> he wrote with Nick Beckstead and Matt Wage).\n</p><h2 id=\"Five_causes_we_would_like_to_investigate_more_deeply\">Five causes we would like to investigate more deeply</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Immigration_reform\">Immigration reform</h3>\n<strong>What it is</strong>: By \u201cimmigration reform,\u201d we mean loosening immigration restrictions in rich countries with stronger political institutions, especially for people who are migrating from poor countries with weaker political institutions. We include both efforts to allow more high-skill immigration and efforts to allow more immigration in general. Some people to talk to in this area include Michael Clemens, Lant Pritchett, and others at the Center for Global Development. Fwd.us and the Krieble Foundation are two examples of organizations working in this area.<p></p><p><strong>Why we think it is promising</strong>: Many individual workers in poor countries could produce much more economic value and better realize their potential in other ways if they lived in rich countries, meaning that much of the world\u2019s human capital is being severely underutilized. This claim is unusually well supported by basic economic theory and the views of a large majority of economists. Many concerns have been raised, but we think the most plausible ones involve political feasibility and political and cultural consequences of migration.\n</p><h3 id=\"Philanthropic_infrastructure\">Philanthropic infrastructure</h3>\n<strong>What it is</strong>: By \u201cphilanthropic infrastructure,\u201d we mean activities that expand the flexible capabilities of those trying to do good in a cause-neutral, outcome-oriented way. Some organizations in this area we are most familiar with include charity evaluator GiveWell, donation pledge organizations (Giving What We Can, The Life You Can Save, the Giving Pledge), and 80,000 Hours (an organization that provides information to help people make career choices that maximize their impact). There are many examples we are less familiar with, such as the Bridgespan Group and the Center for Effective Philanthropy. (Disclosure: Nick Beckstead is on the board of trustees for the Centre for Effective Altruism, which houses Giving What We Can, The Life You Can Save, and 80,000 Hours, though The Life You Can Save is substantially independent.)<p></p><p><strong>Why we think it is promising</strong>: We are interested in this area because we want to build up resources which are flexible enough to ultimately support the causes and opportunities that are later found to be the most promising, and because we see a lot of growth in this area and think early investments may result in more money and talent available for very promising opportunities later on.\n</p><h3 id=\"Methods_for_improved_forecasting\">Methods for improved forecasting</h3>\n<strong>What it is</strong>: Forecasting is challenging, and very high accuracy is difficult to obtain in many of the domains of greatest interest. However, a number of methods have been developed to improve forecasting accuracy through training, aggregation of opinion, incentives, and other means. Some examples include expert judgment aggregation algorithms, probability and calibration training, and prediction markets. \u00a0We are excited about recent progress in this area in a prediction tournament sponsored by IARPA, which Philip Tetlock\u2019s <a href=\"http://goodjudgmentproject.com/blog/\">Good Judgment Project</a> is currently winning.<p></p><p><strong>Why we think it is promising</strong>: Improved forecasting could be useful in a wide variety of political and business contexts. Improved forecasting over a period of multiple years could improve overall preparedness for many global challenges and opportunities. Moreover, strong evidence of the superior performance of some methods of forecasting over others could help policymakers base decisions on the best available evidence. We currently have limited information about room for more funding for existing organizations in this area.\n</p><h3 id=\"Global_catastrophic_risk\">Global catastrophic risk</h3>\n<strong>What it is</strong>: Opportunities in this area focus on identifying and mitigating specific threats of human extinction, such as large asteroid impact and tail risks of climate change and nuclear winter. Examples of interventions in this category include tracking asteroids (which has largely been completed for asteroids that threaten civilization, though not for comets), improving resilience of the food supply through <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/110/18/7182\">cellulose-to-food conversion</a>, disease surveillance (for natural or man-made pandemics), advocacy for non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and research on other possible risks and methods for mitigating them. An unusual view we take seriously is that some of the most significant risks in this area will come from new technologies that may emerge this century, such as advanced artificial intelligence and advanced biological weapons. (We also believe technologies of this type have massive upside potential which must be thought about carefully as we think about the risks.) Notable defenders of views in this vicinity include Martin Rees, Richard Posner, and Nick Bostrom. (Disclosure: Nick Bostrom is the Director at the Future of Humanity Institute, where Nick Beckstead is a research fellow and Carl Shulman is a research associate.)<p></p><p><strong>Why we think it is promising</strong>: Progress in this area has a clear relationship with long-run outcomes for humanity. There have been some very good buys in this area in the past, such as early asteroid tracking programs. Apart from climate change, total foundation spending in this area is around <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/05/08/what-large-scale-philanthropy-focuses-on-today/\">0.1%</a>, and little of that carefully distinguishes between large catastrophes and catastrophes with the potential to significant change long-run outcomes for humanity.\n</p><h3 id=\"Meta_research\">Meta-research</h3>\n<strong>What it is</strong>: We will make use of GiveWell\u2019s explanation of the cause area <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/06/11/meta-research/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/06/meta-research-update/\">here</a>.<p></p><p><strong>Why we think it is promising</strong>: We believe that many improvements in meta-research can accelerate scientific progress and make it easier for non-experts to discern what is known in a field. We believe this is likely to systematically improve our ability to navigate global challenges and opportunities. From a long-term perspective the importance of different impacts of meta-research diverges from a short-term analysis because, e.g. the degree to which policymakers can understand the state of scientific knowledge at any given level of progress looms larger in comparison to simple acceleration of progress.</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "19th Aug 2013", "title": "Preventing human extinction", "author": "Peter_Singer", "num_comments": "8 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p><em><strong>Co-authored by Nick Beckstead, Peter Singer, and Matt Wage</strong></em></p><p>Many scientists believe that a large asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. Could humans face the same fate?</p><p>It\u2019s a possibility. NASA has tracked most of the large nearby asteroids and many of the smaller asteroids. If a large asteroid were found to be on a collision course with Earth, that could give us time to deflect the asteroid. NASA has analyzed multiple options for deflecting an asteroid in this kind of scenario, including using a nuclear strike to knock the asteroid off course, and it seems that some of these strategies would be likely to work. The search is, however, not yet complete. The new B612 foundation has recently begun a project to track the remaining asteroids in order to \u201cprotect the future of civilization on this planet.\u201d Finding one of these asteroids could be the key to preventing a global catastrophe.</p><p>Fortunately, the odds of an extinction-sized asteroid hitting the earth this century are low, on the order of one in a million. Unfortunately, asteroids aren\u2019t the only threats to humanity\u2019s survival. Other potential threats stem from bio-engineered diseases, nuclear war, extreme climate change, and dangerous future technologies.</p><p>Given that there is some risk of humanity going extinct over the next couple of centuries, the next question is whether we can do anything about it. We will first explain what we can do about it, and then ask the deeper ethical question: how bad would human extinction be?</p><p>The first point to make here is that if the risks of human extinction turn out to be \u201csmall,\u201d this shouldn\u2019t lull us into complacency. No sane person would say, \u201cWell, the risk of a nuclear meltdown at this reactor is only 1 in 1000, so we\u2019re not going to worry about it.\u201d When there is some risk of a truly catastrophic outcome and we can reduce or eliminate that risk at an acceptable cost, we should do so. In general, we can measure how bad a particular risk is by multiplying the probability of the bad outcome by how bad the outcome would be. Since human extinction would, as we shall shortly argue, be extremely bad, reducing the risk of human extinction by even a very small amount would be very good.</p><p>Humanity has already done some things that reduce the risk of premature extinction. We\u2019ve made it through the cold war and scaled back our reserves of nuclear weapons. We\u2019ve tracked most of the large asteroids near Earth. We\u2019ve built underground bunkers for \u201ccontinuity of government\u201d purposes, which might help humanity survive certain catastrophes. We\u2019ve instituted disease surveillance programs that track the spread of diseases, so that the world could respond more quickly in the event of a large-scale pandemic. We\u2019ve identified climate change as a potential risk and developed some plans for responding, even if the actual response so far has been lamentably inadequate. We\u2019ve also built institutions that reduce the risk of extinction in subtler ways, such as decreasing the risk of war or improving the government\u2019s ability to respond to a catastrophe.</p><p>One reason to think that it is possible to further reduce the risk of human extinction is that all these things we\u2019ve done could probably be improved. We could track more asteroids, build better bunkers, improve our disease surveillance programs, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, encourage non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and strengthen world institutions in ways that would probably further decrease the risk of human extinction. There is still a substantial challenge in identifying specific worthy projects to support, but it is likely that such projects exist.</p><p>So far, surprisingly little work has been put into systematically understanding the risks of human extinction and how best to reduce them. There have been a few books and papers on the topic of low-probability, high-stakes catastrophes, but there has been very little investigation into the most effective methods of reducing these risks. We know of no in-depth, systematic analysis of the different strategies for reducing these risks. A reasonable first step toward reducing the risk of human extinction is to investigate these issues more thoroughly, or support others in doing so.</p><p>If what we\u2019ve said is correct, then there is some risk of human extinction and we probably have the ability to reduce this risk. There are a lot of important related questions, which are hard to answer: How high a priority should we place on reducing the risk of human extinction? How much should we be prepared to spend on doing so? Where does this fit among the many other things that we can and should be doing, like helping the global poor? (On that, see www.thelifeyoucansave.com) Does the goal of reducing the risk of extinction conflict with ordinary humanitarian goals, or is the best way of reducing the risk of extinction simply to improve the lives of people alive today and empower them to solve the problem themselves?</p><p>We won\u2019t try to address those questions here. Instead, we\u2019ll focus on this question: How bad would human extinction be?</p><p>One very bad thing about human extinction would be that billions of people would likely die painful deaths. But in our view, this is, by far, not the worst thing about human extinction. The worst thing about human extinction is that there would be no future generations.</p><p>We believe that future generations matter just as much as our generation does. Since there could be so many generations in our future, the value of all those generations together greatly exceeds the value of the current generation.</p><p>Considering a historical example helps to illustrate this point. About 70,000 years ago, there was a supervolcanic eruption known as the Toba eruption. Many scientists believe that this eruption caused a \u201cvolcanic winter\u201d which brought our ancestors close to extinction. Suppose that this is true. Now imagine that the Toba eruption had eradicated humans from the earth. How bad would that have been? Some 3000 generations and <a href=\"http://www.prb.org/Articles/2002/HowManyPeopleHaveEverLivedonEarth.aspx\">100 billion lives later</a>, it is plausible to say that the death and suffering caused by the Toba eruption would have been trivial in comparison with the loss of all the human lives that have been lived from then to now, and everything humanity has achieved since that time.</p><p>Similarly, if humanity goes extinct now, the worst aspect of this would be the opportunity cost. Civilization began only a few thousand years ago. Yet Earth could remain habitable for another billion years. And if it is possible to colonize space, our species may survive much longer than that.</p><p>Some people would reject this way of assessing the value of future generations. They may claim that bringing new people into existence cannot be a benefit, regardless of what kind of life these people have. On this view, the value of avoiding human extinction is restricted to people alive today and people who are already going to exist, and who may want to have children or grandchildren.</p><p>Why would someone believe this? One reason might be that if people never exist, then it can\u2019t be bad for them that they don\u2019t exist. Since they don\u2019t exist, there\u2019s no \u201cthem\u201d for it to be bad for, so causing people to exist cannot benefit them.</p><p>We disagree. We think that causing people to exist can benefit them. To see why, first notice that causing people to exist can be bad for those people. For example, suppose some woman knows that if she conceives a child during the next few months, the child will suffer from multiple painful diseases and die very young. It would obviously be bad for her child if she decided to conceive during the next few months. In general, it seems that if a child\u2019s life would be brief and miserable, existence is bad for that child.</p><p>If you agree that bringing someone into existence can be bad for that person and if you also accept the argument that bringing someone into existence can\u2019t be good for that person, then this leads to a strange conclusion: being born could harm you but it couldn\u2019t help you. If that is right, then it appears that it would be wrong to have children, because there is always a risk that they will be harmed, and no compensating benefit to outweigh the risk of harm.</p><p>Pessimists like the nineteenth-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, or the contemporary South African philosopher David Benatar accept this conclusion. But if parents have a reasonable expectation that their children will have happy and fulfilling lives, and having children would not be harmful to others, then it is not bad to have children. More generally, if our descendants have a reasonable chance of having happy and fulfilling lives, it is good for us to ensure that our descendants exist, rather than not. Therefore we think that bringing future generations into existence can be a good thing.</p><p>The extinction of our species \u2013 and quite possibly, depending on the cause of the extinction, of all life - would be the end of the extraordinary story of evolution that has already led to (moderately) intelligent life, and which has given us the potential to make much greater progress still. We have made great progress, both moral and intellectual, over the last couple of centuries, and there is every reason to hope that, if we survive, this progress will continue and accelerate.

It may be useful to adopt the following rule of thumb for such impersonal moral action:</p>\n<p>Maxipok: Maximize the probability of an \u201cOK outcome,\u201d where an OK outcome is any outcome that avoids existential catastrophe.\u201d</p>\n<p>There are a number of people in the <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html\">effective altruism</a>\u00a0community who accept this view and cite Bostrom\u2019s argument as their primary justification. Many of these people also believe that the best ways of minimizing existential risk involve making plans to prevent specific existential catastrophes from occurring, and believe that the best giving opportunities must be with charities that primarily focus on reducing existential risk. They also appeal to Bostrom\u2019s argument to support their views. (Edited to add: Note that Bostrom himself sees maxipok as neutral on the question of whether the best methods of reducing existential risk are very broad and general, or highly targeted and specific.) For one example of this, see Luke Muehlhauser\u2019s <a href=\"/lw/di4/reply_to_holden_on_the_singularity_institute/\">comment</a>:</p>\n<p>\u201cMany humans living today value both current and future people enough that\u00a0<em>if</em>\u00a0existential catastrophe is plausible this century, then upon reflection (e.g. after counteracting their unconscious, default\u00a0<a href=\"/lw/hw/scope_insensitivity/\">scope insensitivity</a>) they would conclude that reducing the risk of existential catastrophe is the most valuable thing they can do \u2014 whether through direct work or by\u00a0<a href=\"http://singularity.org/donate/\">donating</a>\u00a0to support direct work.\u201d</p>\n<p>I now think these views require some significant adjustments and qualifications, and given these adjustments and qualifications, their practical implications become very uncertain. I still believe that what matters most about what we do is how our actions affect humanity\u2019s long-term future potential, and I still believe that targeted existential risk reduction and research is a promising cause, but it now seems unclear whether targeted existential risk reduction is the best area to look for ways of making the distant future go as well as possible. It may be and it may not be, and which is right probably depends on many messy details about specific opportunities, as well as general methodological considerations which are, at this point, highly uncertain. Various considerations played a role in my reasoning about this, and I intend to talk about more of them in greater detail in the future. I\u2019ll talk about just a couple of these considerations in this post.</p>\n<p>In this post, I argue that:</p><p></p><p></p><ol>\n\t<li><strong>Though Bostrom\u2019s argument supports the conclusion that maximizing humanity\u2019s long term potential is extremely important, it does not provide strong evidence that reducing existential risk is the best way of maximizing humanity\u2019s future potential.</strong><span> There is a much broader class of actions which may affect humanity\u2019s long-term potential, and Bostrom\u2019s argument does not uniquely favor existential risk over other members in this class.</span></li>\n\t<li><strong>A version of Bostrom\u2019s argument better supports a more general view: what matters most is that we make path-dependent aspects of the far future go as well as possible. </strong><span>There are important questions about whether we should accept this more general view and what its practical significance is, but this more general view seems to be a strict improvement on the view that minimizing existential risk is what matters most.</span></li>\n\t<li><strong>The above points favor very broad, general, and indirect approaches to shaping the far future for the better</strong><span>, rather than thinking about very specific risks and responses, though there are many relevant considerations and the issue is far from settled.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<span>I think some prominent advocates of existential risk reduction already agree with these general points, and believe that other arguments, or other arguments together with Bostrom\u2019s argument, establish that direct existential risk reduction is what matters most. This post is most relevant to people who currently think Bostrom\u2019s arguments may settle the issues discussed above.</span>\n<h2 id=\"Path_dependence_and_trajectory_changes\">Path-dependence and trajectory changes</h2>\n<p>In thinking about how we might affect the far future, I've found it useful to use the concept of the world's <em>development trajectory</em>, or just trajectory for short. The world's development trajectory, as I use the term, is a rough summary way the future will unfold over time. The summary includes various facts about the world that matter from a macro perspective, such as how rich people are, what technologies are available, how happy people are, how developed our science and culture is along various dimensions, and how well things are going all-things-considered at different points of time. It may help to think of the trajectory as a collection of graphs, where each graph in the collection has time on the x-axis and one of these other variables on the y-axis.</p>\n<p>With that concept in place, consider three different types of benefits from doing good. First, doing something good might have <em>proximate benefits</em>\u2014this is the name I give to the fairly short-run, fairly predictable benefits that we ordinarily think about when we cure some child's blindness, save a life, or help an old lady cross the street. Second, there are <em>benefits from speeding up development</em>. In many cases, <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">ripple effects</a>\u00a0from good ordinary actions speed up development. For example, saving some child's life might cause his country's economy to develop very slightly more quickly, or make certain technological or cultural innovations arrive more quickly. Third, our actions may slightly or significantly alter the world's development trajectory. I call these shifts <em>trajectory changes</em>. If we ever prevent an existential catastrophe, that would be an extreme example of a trajectory change. There may also be smaller trajectory changes. For example, if some species of dolphins that we really loved were destroyed, that would be a much smaller trajectory change.</p>\n<p>The concept of a trajectory change is closely related to the concept of path dependence in the social sciences, though when I talk about trajectory changes I am interested in effects that persist much longer than standard examples of path dependence. A classic example of path dependence is our use of QWERTY keyboards. Our keyboards could have been arranged in any number of other possible ways. A large part of the explanation of why we use QWERTY keyboards is that it happened to be convenient for making typewriters, that a lot of people learned to use these keyboards, and there are advantages to having most people use the same kind of keyboard. In essence, there is path dependence whenever some aspect of the future could easily have been way X, but it is arranged in way Y due to something that happened in the past, and now it would be hard or impossible to switch to way X. Path dependence is especially interesting when way X would have been better than way Y. Some political scientists have argued that path dependence is very common in politics. For example, in an influential paper (with over 3000 citations) <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2586011?uid=3739576&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101564634081\">Pierson</a> (2000, p. 251) argues that:</p>\n<p>Specific patterns of timing and sequence matter; a wide range of social outcomes may be possible; large consequences may result from relatively small or contingent events; particular courses of action, once introduced, can be almost impossible to reverse; and consequently, political development is punctuated by critical moments or junctures that shape the basic contours of social life.</p>\n<p>The concept of a trajectory change is also closely related to the concept of a historical contingency. If Thomas Edison had not invented the light bulb, someone else would have done it later. In this sense, it is not historically contingent that we have light bulbs, and the most obvious benefits from Thomas Edison inventing the light bulb are proximate benefits and benefits from speeding up development. Something analogous is probably true of many other technological innovations such as computers, candles, wheelbarrows, object-oriented programming, and the printing press. Some important examples of historical contingencies: the rise of Christianity, the creation of the US Constitution, and the writings of Karl Marx. Various aspects of Christian morality influence the world today in significant ways, but the fact that those aspects of morality, in exactly those ways, were part of a dominant world religion was historically contingent. And therefore events like Jesus's death and Paul writing his epistles are examples of trajectory changes. Likewise, the US Constitution was the product of deliberation among a specific set of men, the document affects government policy today and will affect it for the foreseeable future, but it could easily have been a different document. And now that the document exists in its specific legal and historical context, it is challenging to make changes to it, so the change is somewhat self-reinforcing.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 id=\"Some_small_trajectory_changes_could_be_suboptimal\">Some small trajectory changes could be suboptimal</h2>\n<p>Persistent trajectory changes that do not involve existential catastrophes could have great significance for shaping the far future. It is unlikely that the far future will inherit many of our institutions exactly as they are, but <strong>various aspects of the far future\u2014including social norms, values, political systems, and perhaps even some technologies\u2014may be path dependent on what happens now, and sometimes in suboptimal ways.</strong> In general, it is reasonable to assume that if there is some problem that might exist in the future and we can do something to fix it now, future people would also be able to solve that problem. But if values or social norms change, they might not agree that some things we think are problems <em>really are</em> problems. Or, if people make the wrong decisions now, certain standards or conventions may get entrenched, and resulting problems may be too expensive to be worth fixing. For further categories of examples of path-dependent aspects of the far future, see <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/12/long-legacies.html\">these</a>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/10/how-plastic-are-people.html\">posts</a>\u00a0by <a href=\"http://hanson.gmu.edu/\">Robin Hanson</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 id=\"The_astronomical_waste_argument_and_trajectory_changes\">The astronomical waste argument and trajectory changes</h2>\n<p>Bostrom\u2019s argument only works if reducing existential risk is the most effective way of maximizing humanity\u2019s future potential. But<strong> there is no robust argument that trying to reduce existential risk is a more effective way of shaping the far future than trying to create other positive trajectory changes. </strong>Bostrom\u2019s argument for the overwhelming importance of reducing existential risk can be summarized as follows:<strong></strong></p><p></p><p></p><ol>\n\t<li><span>The expected size of humanity's future influence is astronomically great.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>If the expected size of humanity's future influence is astronomically great, then the expected value of the future is astronomically great.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>If\u00a0the expected value of the future is astronomically great, then what matters most is that we maximize humanity\u2019s long-term potential.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>Some of our actions are expected to reduce existential risk in not-ridiculously-small ways.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>If what matters most is that we maximize humanity\u2019s future potential and some of our actions are expected to reduce existential risk in not-ridiculously-small ways, what it is best to do is primarily determined by how our actions are expected to reduce existential risk.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>Therefore, what it is best to do is primarily determined by how our actions are expected to reduce existential risk.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<span>Call that the \u201castronomical waste\u201d argument.</span>\n<p>It is unclear whether premise (5) is true because it is unclear whether trying to reduce existential risk is the most effective way of maximizing humanity\u2019s future potential. For all we know, it could be more effective to try to create other positive trajectory changes. Clearly, it would be better to prevent extinction than to improve our social norms in a way that indirectly makes the future go one millionth better, but, in general, \u201cX is a bigger problem than Y\u201d is only a <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2009/04/20/the-most-important-problem-may-not-be-the-best-charitable-cause/\">weak argument</a> that \u201ctrying to address X is more important than trying to address Y.\u201d To be strong, the argument must be supplemented by looking at many other considerations related to X and Y, such as how much effort is going into solving X and Y, how tractable X and Y are, how much X and Y could use additional resources, and whether there are subsets of X or Y that are especially strong in terms of these considerations.</p>\n<p>Bostrom <em>does</em> have arguments that speeding up development and providing proximate benefits are not as important, in themselves, as reducing existential risk. And these arguments, I believe, have some plausibility. <strong>Since we don\u2019t have an argument that reducing existential risk is better than trying to create other positive trajectory changes and an existential catastrophe is one type of trajectory change, it seems more reasonable for defenders of the astronomical waste argument to focus on trajectory changes in general.</strong> It would be better to replace the last two steps of the above argument with:</p>\n<p>4\u2019 \u00a0 Some of our actions are expected to change our development trajectory in not-ridiculously-small ways.</p>\n<p>5\u2019. \u00a0If what matters most is that we maximize humanity\u2019s future potential and some of our actions are expected to change our development trajectory in not-ridiculously-small ways, what it is best to do is primarily determined by how our actions are expected to change our development trajectory.</p>\n<p>6\u2019. \u00a0Therefore, what it is best to do is primarily determined by how our actions are expected to change our development trajectory.</p>\n<p>This seems to be a strictly more plausible claim than the original one, though it is less focused.</p>\n<p>In response to the arguments in this post, which I e-mailed him in advance, Bostrom wrote a reply (see the end of the post). The key comment, from my perspective, is:</p>\n<p>\u201cMany trajectory changes are already encompassed within the notion of an existential catastrophe. \u00a0Becoming permanently locked into some radically suboptimal state is an xrisk. \u00a0The notion is more useful to the extent that likely scenarios fall relatively sharply into two distinct categories---very good ones and very bad ones. \u00a0To the extent that there is a wide range of scenarios that are roughly equally plausible and that vary continuously in the degree to which the trajectory is good, the existential risk concept will be a less useful tool for thinking about our choices. \u00a0One would then have to resort to a more complicated calculation. \u00a0However, extinction is quite dichotomous, and there is also a thought that many sufficiently good future civilizations would over time asymptote to the optimal track.\u201d</p>\n<p>I agree that a key question here is whether there is a very large range of plausible equilibria for advanced civilizations, or whether civilizations that manage to survive long enough naturally converge on something close to the best possible outcome. The more confidence one has in the second possibility, the more interesting existential risk is as a concept. The less confidence one has in the second possibility, the more interesting trajectory changes in general are. However, I would emphasize that unless we can be highly confident in the second possibility, it seems that we cannot be confident that reducing existential risk is more important than creating other positive trajectory changes because of the astronomical waste argument alone. This would turn on further considerations of the sort I described above.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 id=\"Broad_and_narrow_strategies_for_shaping_the_far_future\">Broad and narrow strategies for shaping the far future</h2>\n<p>Both the astronomical waste argument and the fixed up version of that argument conclude that what matters most is how our actions affect the far future. I am very sympathetic to this viewpoint, abstractly considered, but I think its practical implications are highly uncertain. There is a spectrum of strategies for shaping the far future that ranges from the very targeted (e.g., stop that asteroid from hitting the Earth) to very broad (e.g., create economic growth, help the poor, provide education programs for talented youth), with options like \u201ctell powerful people about the importance of shaping the far future\u201d in between. The limiting case of breadth might be just optimizing for proximate benefits or for speeding up development. Defenders of the astronomical waste argument tend to be on the highly targeted end of this spectrum. I think it\u2019s a very interesting question where on this spectrum we should prefer to be, other things being equal, and it\u2019s a topic I plan to return to in the future.</p>\n<p>The arguments I\u2019ve offered above favor broader strategies for shaping the far future, though they don\u2019t settle the issue. The main reason I say this is that <strong>the best ways of creating positive trajectory changes may be very broad and general, whereas the best ways of reducing existential risk may be more narrow and specific.</strong> For example, it may be reasonable to try to assess, in detail, questions like, \u201cWhat are the largest specific existential risks?\u201d and, \u201cWhat are the most effective ways of reducing those specific risks?\u201d In contrast, it seems less promising to try to make specific guesses about how we might create smaller positive trajectory changes because there are so many possibilities and many trajectory changes do not have significance that is predictable in advance. No one could have predicted the persistent ripple effects that Jesus's life had, for example. In other cases\u2014such as the framing of the US Constitution\u2014it's clear that a decision has trajectory change potential, but it would be hard to specify, in advance, which concrete measures should be taken. In general, it seems that the worse you are at predicting some phenomenon that is critical to your plans, the less your plans should depend on specific predictions about that phenomenon. Because of this, promising ways to create positive trajectory changes in the world may be more broad than the most promising ways of trying to reduce existential risk specifically. Improving education, improving parenting, improving science, improving our political system, spreading humanitarian values, or otherwise improving our collective wisdom as stewards of the future could, I believe, create many small, unpredictable positive trajectory changes.</p>\n<p>I do not mean to suggest that broad approaches are necessarily best, only that people interested in shaping the far future should take them more seriously than they currently do. The way I see the trade-off between highly targeted strategies and highly broad strategies is as follows. Highly targeted strategies for shaping the far future often depend on highly speculative plans, often with many steps, which are hard to execute. We often have very little sense of whether we are making valuable progress on AI risk research or geo-engineering research. On the other hand, highly broad strategies must rely on implicit assumptions about the ripple effects of doing good in more ordinary ways. It is very subtle and speculative to say how ordinary actions are related to positive trajectory changes, and estimating magnitudes seems extremely challenging. Considering these trade-offs in specific cases seems like a promising area for additional research.<strong></strong></p><p></p><p></p><h2 id=\"Summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>In this post, I argued that:</p><p></p><p></p><ol>\n\t<li><span>The astronomical waste argument becomes strictly more plausible if we replace the idea of minimizing existential risk with the idea of creating positive trajectory changes.</span></li>\n\t<li><span>There are many ways in which our actions could unpredictably affect our general development trajectory, and therefore many ways in which our actions could shape the far future for the better.

And I do think we can influence the far future. I just don't think we can do it in a <i>reliable</i> way.

Why? My case is that speculative causes, or any cause with high uncertainty (reducing nonhuman animal suffering, reducing existential risk, etc.) requires that we rely on our commonsense to evaluate them with na\u012bve cost-effectiveness calculations, and this is (1) demonstrably unreliable with a bad track record, (2) plays right into common biases, and (3) doesn\u2019t make sense based on how we ideally make decisions.

It just makes sense that if we fund cultural exchange programs between the US and China, there will be more goodwill for the other within each country, and therefore the countries will be less likely to nuke each other. Since nuclear war would likely be very bad, it's of high value to fund cultural exchange programs, right?<p></p><p>Let's try another. The <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/\">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> (MIRI) thinks that someday artificial intelligent agents will become better than humans at making AIs.

It's important that this superintelligence be programmed to be benevolent, or things will likely be very bad. And we can stop this bad event by funding MIRI to <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/research/\">write more papers about AI</a>, right?</p><p>Or how about this one? It seems like there will be challenges in the far future that will be very daunting, and if humanity handles them wrong, things will be very bad.

Existential risk reduction, for example, requires making predictions about what will happen in the far future, and how your actions are likely to effect events hundreds of years down the road. Yet, experts are notoriously bad at making these kinds of predictions.<p></p><p>James Shanteau found in <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/074959789290064E\">\"Competence in Experts: The Role of Task Characteristics\"</a> (see also Kahneman and Klein's <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/64/6/515/\">\"Conditions for Intuitive Expertise: A Failure to Disagree\"</a>) that experts perform well when thinking about static stimuli, thinking about things, and when there is feedback and objective analysis available. Furthermore, experts perform pretty badly when thinking about dynamic stimuli, thinking about behavior, and feedback and objective analysis are unavailable.</p><p>Predictions about existential risk reduction and the far future are firmly in the second category. So how can we trust our predictions about our impact on the far future? Our only recourse is to fall back on interventions that we can reliably predict, until we get better at prediction (or invest money in getting better at making predictions).\n</p><h3 id=\"Even_broad_effects_require_specific_attempts\">Even broad effects require specific attempts</h3>\nOne potential resolution to this problem is to argue for \u201cbroad effects\u201d rather than \u201cspecific attempts\u201d. Perhaps it\u2019s difficult to know whether a particular intervention will go well or mistaken to focus entirely on Friendly AI, but surely if we improved incentives and norms in academic work to better advance human knowledge (meta-research), improved education, or advocated for effective altruism, the far future would be much better equipped to handle threats.<p></p><p>I agree that these broad effects would make the far future better and I agree that it\u2019s possible to implement these broad effects and change the far future. The problem, however, is it can\u2019t be done in an easy or well understood way. Any attempt to implement a broad effect would require a specific action that has an unknown expectation of success and unknown cost-effectiveness. It\u2019s definitely beneficial to advocate for effective altruism, but could this be done in a cost-effective way? A way that\u2019s more cost-effective at producing welfare than AMF? How would you know?</p><p>In order to accomplish these broad effects, you\u2019d need specific organizations and interventions to channel your time and money into. And by picking these specific organizations and interventions, you\u2019re losing the advantage of broad effects and tying yourself to particular things with poorly understood impact and no track record to evaluate.\n</p><h2 id=\"Focusing_on_speculative_causes_plays_into_our_biases\">Focusing on speculative causes plays into our biases</h2>\nWe've now known for quite a long time that people are not all that rational. Instead, human thinking fails in very predictable and systematic ways. Some of these ways make us less likely to take speculative causes seriously, such as ambiguity aversion, the absurdity heuristic, scope neglect, and overconfidence bias.<p></p><p>But there\u2019s also a different side of the coin, with biases that might make people think badly about existential risk:</p><p><b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias\">Optimism bias</a>.</b> People generally think things will turn out better than they actually will. This could lead people to think that their projects will have a higher impact than they actually will, which would lead to higher estimates of cost-effectiveness than is reasonable.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_control\">Control bias</a>.</b> People like to think they have more control over things than they actually do. This plausibly also includes control over the far future. Therefore, people are probably biased into thinking they have more control over the far future than they actually do, leading to higher estimates of ability to influence the future than is reasonable.</p><p><b>\"Wow factor\" bias.</b> People seem attracted to more impressive claims. Saving a life for $2500 through a malaria bed net seems much more boring compared to the chance of saving the entire world by averting a global catastrophe. Within the effective altruist / LessWrong community, existential risk reduction is cool and high status, whereas averting global poverty is not. This might lead to more endorsement of existential risk reduction than is reasonable.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy\">Conjunction fallacy</a>.</b> People have a problem assessing probability properly when there are many steps involved, each of which has a chance of not happening. Ten steps, each with an independent 90% success rate, has only a 35% chance of success. Focusing on the far future seems to involve that a lot of largely independent events happen the way that is predicted. This would mean people are worse at estimating their chances of helping the far future, creating higher cost-effectiveness estimates than is reasonable.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias\">Selection bias</a>.</b> When trying to find trends in history that are favorable for affecting the far future, some examples can be provided. However, this is because we usually hear about the interventions that end up working, whereas all the failed attempts to influence the far future are never heard of again. This creates a very skewed sample that can negatively bias our thinking about our success of influencing the far future.</p><p>It\u2019s concerning there are numerous biases both weighted in favor and weighted against speculative causes, and this means we must tread carefully when assessing their merits. However, I would strongly expect biases to be even worse in favor of speculative causes rather than against them, because speculative causes lack the available feedback and objective evidence needed to help insulate against bias, whereas a focus on global health does not.\n</p><h2 id=\"Focusing_on_speculative_uses_bad_decision_theory\">Focusing on speculative uses bad decision theory</h2>\nFurthermore, not only is the case for speculative causes undermined by a bad track record and possible cognitive biases, but the underlying decision theory seems suspect in a way that's difficult to place.\n<h3 id=\"Would_you_play_a_lottery_with_no_stated_odds_\">Would you play a lottery with no stated odds?</h3>\nImagine another thought experiment -- you're asked to play a lottery. You have to pay $2 to play, but you have a chance at winning $100. Do you play?<p></p><p>Of course, you don't know, because you're not given odds. Rationally, it makes sense to play any lottery where you expect to come out ahead more often than not. If the lottery is a coin flip, it makes sense to pay $2 to have a 50/50 shot to win $100, since you'd expect to win $50 on average, and come ahead $48 each time. With a sufficiently high reward, even a one in a million chance is worth it. Pay $2 for a 1/1M chance of winning $1B, and you'd expect to come out ahead by $998 each time.</p><p>But $2 for the chance to win $100, without knowing what the chance is? Even if you had some sort of bounds, like you knew the odds had to be at least 1/150 and at most 1/10, though you could be off by a little bit. Would you accept that bet?</p><p>Such a bet seems intuitively uninviting to me, yet this is the bet that speculative causes offer me.\n</p><h3 id=\"_Conservative_orders_of_magnitude__arguments\">\"Conservative orders of magnitude\" arguments</h3>\nIn response to these considerations, I've seen people endorsing speculative causes look at their calculations and remark that even if their estimate were off by 1000x, or three orders of magnitude, they still would be on solid ground for high impact, and there's no way they're actually off by three orders of magnitude. However, Nate Silver's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/159420411X\"><b>The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail \u2014 but Some Don't</b></a> offers a cautionary tale:\n<blockquote>Moody\u2019s, for instance, went through a period of making ad hoc adjustments to its model in which it increased the default probability assigned to AAA-rated securities by 50 percent. That might seem like a very prudent attitude: surely a 50 percent buffer will suffice to account for any slack in one\u2019s assumptions? It might have been fine had the potential for error in their forecasts been linear and arithmetic. But leverage, or investments financed by debt, can make the error in a forecast compound many times over, and introduces the potential of highly geometric and nonlinear mistakes.<p></p><p>Moody\u2019s 50 percent adjustment was like applying sunscreen and claiming it protected you from a nuclear meltdown\u2014wholly inadequate to the scale of the problem. It wasn\u2019t just a possibility that their estimates of default risk could be 50 percent too low: they might just as easily have underestimated it by 500 percent or 5,000 percent. In practice, defaults were two hundred times more likely than the ratings agencies claimed, meaning that their model was off by a mere 20,000 percent.</p></blockquote>\nSilver points out that when estimating how safe mortgage backed securities were, the difference between assuming defaults are perfectly uncorrelated and defaults are perfectly correlated is a difference of 160,000x in your risk estimate -- or five orders of magnitude.<p></p><p>If these kinds of five-orders-of-magnitude errors are possible in a realm that has actual feedback and is moderately understood, how do we know the estimates for cost-effectiveness are safe for speculative causes that are poorly understood and offer no feedback? Again, our only recourse is to fall back on interventions that we can reliably predict, until we get better at prediction.\n</p><h2 id=\"Value_of_information__exploring__and_exploiting\">Value of information, exploring, and exploiting</h2>\nOf course, there still is one important aspect of this problem that has not been discussed -- <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information\">value of information</a> -- or the idea that sometimes it\u2019s worth doing something just to learn more about how the world works. This is important in effective altruism too, where we focus specifically on \u201cgiving to learn\u201d, or using our resources to figure out more about the impact of various causes.<p></p><p>I think this is actually really important and is not a victim to any of my previous arguments, because we\u2019re not talking about impact, but rather learning value. Perhaps one could look to an \u201c<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit\">explore-exploit model</a>\u201d, or the idea that we achieve the best outcome when we spend a lot of time exploring first (learning more about how to achieve better outcomes) before exploiting (focusing resources on achieving the best outcome we can). Therefore, whenever we have an opportunity to \u201cexplore\u201d further or learn more about what causes have high impact, we should take it.\n</p><h3 id=\"Learning_in_practice\">Learning in practice</h3>\nUnfortunately, in practice, I think these opportunities are very rare. Many organizations that I think are \u201cpromising\u201d and worth funding further to see what their impact looks like do not have sufficiently good self-measurement in place to actually assess their impact or sufficient transparency to provide that information, therefore making it difficult to actually learn from them. And on the other side of things, many very promising opportunities to learn more are already fully funded. One must be careful to ensure that it\u2019s actually one\u2019s marginal dollar that is getting marginal information.\n<h3 id=\"The_typical_donor\">The typical donor</h3>\nAdditionally, I don\u2019t think the typical donor is in a very good position to assess where there is high value of information or have the time and knowledge to act upon this information once it is acquired. I think there\u2019s a good argument for people in the \u201ceffective altruist\u201d movement to perhaps make small investments in EA organizations and encourage transparency and good measurement in their operations to see if they\u2019re successfully doing what they claim (or potentially create an EA startup themselves to see if it would work, though this carries large risks of further splitting the resources of the movement).<p></p><p>But even that would take a very savvy and involved effective altruist to pull off. Assessing the value of information on more massive investments like large-scale research or innovation efforts would be significantly more difficult, beyond the talent and resources of nearly all effective altruists, and are probably left to full-time foundations or subject-matter experts.\n</p><h3 id=\"GiveWell_s_top_charities_also_have_high_value_of_information\">GiveWell\u2019s top charities also have high value of information</h3>\nAs Luke Muehlhauser mentions in <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hsd/start_under_the_streetlight_then_push_into_the/\">\u201cStart Under the Streetlight, Then Push Into the Shadows\u201d</a>, lots of lessons can be learned only by focusing on the easiest causes first, even if we have strong theoretical reasons to expect that they won\u2019t end up being the highest impact causes once we have more complete knowledge.<p></p><p>We can use global health cost-effectiveness considerations as practice for slowly and carefully moving into the more complex and less understood domains. There even are some very natural transitions, such as beginning to look at \u201c<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">flow through effects</a>\u201d of reducing disease in the third-world and beginning to look at how more esoteric things affect the disease burden, like climate change. Therefore, even additional funding for GiveWell\u2019s top charities has high value of information. And notably, GiveWell is beginning this \u201cpush\u201d through <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/category/givewell-labs/\">GiveWell Labs</a>.\n</p><h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\nThe bottom line is that sometimes things look too good to be true. Therefore, I should expect that the actual impact of speculative causes that make large promises, upon a thorough investigation, will be much lower.\nAnd this has been true in other domains. People are notoriously bad at estimating the effects of causes in both the developed world and developing world, and those are the causes that are near to us, provide us with feedback, and are easy to predict. Yet, from the Even Start Family Literacy Program to deworming estimates, our commonsense has failed us.<p></p><p>Add to that the fact that we should expect ourselves to perform even worse at predicting the far future. Add to that optimism bias, control bias, \"wow factor\" bias, and the conjunction fallacy, which make it difficult for us to think realistically about speculative causes. And then add to that considerations in decision theory, and whether we would bet on a lottery with no stated odds.</p><p>When all is said and done, I'm very skeptical of speculative projects. Therefore, I think we should be focused on exploring and exploiting. We should do whatever we can to fund projects aimed at learning more, when those are available, but be careful to make sure they actually have learning value. And when exploring isn\u2019t available, we should exploit what opportunities we have and fund proven interventions.</p><p>But don\u2019t confuse these two concepts and fund causes intended for learning because of their actual impact value. I\u2019m skeptical about these causes actually being high impact, though I\u2019m open to the idea that they might be and look forward to funding them in the future when they become better proven.</p><p><i>I'd like to thank Nick Beckstead, Joey Savoie, Xio Kikauka, Carl Shulman, Ryan Carey, Tom Ash, Pablo Stafforini, Eliezer Yudkowsky, and Ben Hoskin for providing feedback on this essay, even if some of them might strongly disagree with its conclusion.</i></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "3rd Sep 2013", "title": "Efficient charity: do unto others...", "author": "Scott_Siskind", "num_comments": "6 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Imagine you are setting out on a dangerous expedition through the Arctic on a limited budget. The grizzled old prospector at the general store shakes his head sadly: you can't afford everything you need; you'll just have to purchase the bare essentials and hope you get lucky. But what is essential? Should you buy the warmest parka, if it means you can't afford a sleeping bag? Should you bring an extra week's food, just in case, even if it means going without a rifle? Or can you buy the rifle, leave the food, and hunt for your dinner?</p>\n<p>And how about the field guide to Arctic flowers? You like flowers, and you'd hate to feel like you're failing to appreciate the harsh yet delicate environment around you. And a digital camera, of course - if you make it back alive, you'll have to put the Arctic expedition pics up on Facebook. And a hand-crafted scarf with authentic Inuit tribal patterns woven from organic fibres! Wicked!</p>\n<p>...but of course buying any of those items would be insane. The problem is what economists call opportunity costs: buying one thing costs money that could be used to buy others. A hand-crafted designer scarf might have some value in the Arctic, but it would cost so much it would prevent you from buying much more important things. And when your life is on the line, things like impressing your friends and buying organic pale in comparison. You have one goal - staying alive - and your only problem is how to distribute your resources to keep your chances as high as possible. These sorts of economics concepts are natural enough when faced with a journey through the freezing tundra.</p>\n<p>But they are decidedly not natural when facing a decision about charitable giving. Most donors say they want to \"help people\". If that's true, they should try to distribute their resources to help people as much as possible. Most people don't. In the <a href=\"http://www.artfund.org/savebluerigi/Introduction.html\">\"Buy A Brushstroke\"</a> campaign, eleven thousand British donors gave a total of 550,000 pounds to keep the famous painting \"Blue Rigi\" in a UK museum. If they had given that 550,000 pounds to buy better sanitation systems in African villages instead, the latest statistics suggest it would have saved the lives of about one thousand two hundred people from disease. Each individual $50 donation could have given a year of normal life back to a Third Worlder afflicted with a disabling condition like blindness or limb deformity..</p>\n<p>Most of those 11,000 donors genuinely wanted to help people by preserving access to the original canvas of a beautiful painting. And most of those 11,000 donors, if you asked, would say that a thousand people's lives are more important than a beautiful painting, original or no. But these people didn't have the proper mental habits to realize that was the choice before them, and so a beautiful painting remains in a British museum and somewhere in the Third World a thousand people are dead.</p>\n<p>If you are to \"love your neighbor as yourself\", then you should be as careful in maximizing the benefit to others when donating to charity as you would be in maximizing the benefit to yourself when choosing purchases for a polar trek. And if you wouldn't buy a pretty picture to hang on your sled in preference to a parka, you should consider not helping save a famous painting in preference to helping save a thousand lives.</p>\n<p>Not all charitable choices are as simple as that one, but many charitable choices do have right answers. GiveWell.org, a site which collects and interprets data on the effectiveness of charities, predicts that antimalarial drugs save one child from malaria per $5,000 worth of medicine, but insecticide-treated bed nets save one child from malaria per $500 worth of netting. If you want to save children, donating bed nets instead of antimalarial drugs is the objectively right answer, the same way buying a $500 TV instead of an identical TV that costs $5,000 is the right answer. And since saving a child from diarrheal disease costs $5,000, donating to an organization fighting malaria instead of an organization fighting diarrhea is the right answer, unless you are donating based on some criteria other than whether you're helping children or not.</p>\n<p>Say all of the best Arctic explorers agree that the three most important things for surviving in the Arctic are good boots, a good coat, and good food. Perhaps they have run highly unethical studies in which they release thousands of people into the Arctic with different combination of gear, and consistently find that only the ones with good boots, coats, and food survive. Then there is only one best answer to the question \"What gear do I buy if I want to survive\" - good boots, good food, and a good coat. Your preferences are irrelevant; you may choose to go with alternate gear, but only if you don't mind dying.</p>\n<p>And likewise, there is only one best charity: the one that helps the most people the greatest amount per dollar. This is vague, and it is up to you to decide whether a charity that raises forty children's marks by one letter grade for $100 helps people more or less than one that prevents one fatal case of tuberculosis per $100 or one that saves twenty acres of rainforest per $100. But you cannot abdicate the decision, or you risk ending up like the 11,000 people who accidentally decided that a pretty picture was worth more than a thousand people's lives.</p>\n<p>Deciding which charity is the best is hard. It may be straightforward to say that one form of antimalarial therapy is more effective than another. But how do both compare to financing medical research that might or might not develop a \"magic bullet\" cure for malaria? Or financing development of a new kind of supercomputer that might speed up all medical research? There is no easy answer, but the question has to be asked.</p>\n<p>What about just comparing charities on overhead costs, the one easy-to-find statistic that's universally applicable across all organizations? This solution is simple, elegant, and wrong. High overhead costs are only one possible failure mode for a charity. Consider again the Arctic explorer, trying to decide between a $200 parka and a $200 digital camera. Perhaps a parka only cost $100 to make and the manufacturer takes $100 profit, but the camera cost $200 to make and the manufacturer is selling it at cost. This speaks in favor of the moral qualities of the camera manufacturer, but given the choice the explorer should still buy the parka. The camera does something useless very efficiently, the parka does something vital inefficiently. A parka sold at cost would be best, but in its absence the explorer shouldn't hesitate to choose the the parka over the camera. The same applies to charity. An antimalarial net charity that saves one life per $500 with 50% overhead is better than an antidiarrheal drug charity that saves one life per $5000 with 0% overhead: $10,000 donated to the high-overhead charity will save ten lives; $10,000 to the lower-overhead will only save two. Here the right answer is to donate to the antimalarial charity while encouraging it to find ways to lower its overhead. In any case, <a href=\"http://www.charitynavigator.org/\">examining the financial practices of a charity</a> is helpful but not enough to answer the \"which is the best charity?\" question.</p>\n<p>Just as there is only one best charity, there is only one best way to donate to that charity. Whether you <a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/65/money_the_unit_of_caring/\">volunteer versus donate money</a> versus raise awareness is your own choice, but that choice has consequences. If a high-powered lawyer who makes $1,000 an hour chooses to take an hour off to help clean up litter on the beach, he's wasted the opportunity to work overtime that day, make $1,000, donate to a charity that will hire a hundred poor people for $10/hour to clean up litter, and end up with a hundred times more litter removed. If he went to the beach because he wanted the sunlight and the fresh air and the warm feeling of personally contributing to something, that's fine. If he actually wanted to help people by beautifying the beach, he's chosen an objectively wrong way to go about it. And if he wanted to help people, period, he's chosen a very wrong way to go about it, since that $1,000 could save two people from malaria. Unless the litter he removed is really worth more than two people's lives to him, he's erring even according to his own value system.</p>\n<p>...and the same is true if his philanthropy leads him to work full-time at a nonprofit instead of going to law school to become a lawyer who makes $1,000 / hour in the first place. Unless it's one HELL of a nonprofit.</p>\n<p>The Roman historian Sallust said of Cato \"He preferred to be good, rather than to seem so\". The lawyer who quits a high-powered law firm to work at a nonprofit organization certainly seems like a good person. But if we define \"good\" as helping people, then the lawyer who stays at his law firm but donates the profit to charity is taking Cato's path of maximizing how much good he does, rather than how good he looks.</p>\n<p>And this dichotomy between being and seeming good applies not only to looking good to others, but to ourselves. When we donate to charity, one incentive is the <a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/6z/purchase_fuzzies_and_utilons_separately/\">warm glow of a job well done</a>. A lawyer who spends his day picking up litter will feel a sense of personal connection to his sacrifice and relive the memory of how nice he is every time he and his friends return to that beach. A lawyer who works overtime and donates the money online to starving orphans in Romania may never get that same warm glow. But concern with a warm glow is, at root, concern about seeming good rather than being good - albeit seeming good to yourself rather than to others. There's nothing wrong with donating to charity as a form of entertainment if it's what you want - giving money to the Art Fund may well be a quicker way to give yourself a warm feeling than seeing a romantic comedy at the cinema - but charity given by people who genuinely want to be good and not just to feel that way requires more forethought.</p>\n<p>It is important to be rational about charity for the same reason it is important to be rational about Arctic exploration: it requires the same awareness of opportunity costs and the same hard-headed commitment to investigating efficient use of resources, and it may well be a matter of life and death. Consider going to <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org\">www.GiveWell.org</a> and making use of the excellent resources on effective charity they have available.</p></div></div>"},

It\u2019s natural to start with the part that I know best: the history of my own involvement with effective altruism.</p>\n<p><a></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"Interest_in_altruism_rooted_in_literature\">Interest in altruism rooted in literature</h2>\n<p>My interest in altruism traces to early childhood. Unbeknownst to me, my verbal comprehension ability was unusually high relative to my other cognitive abilities, and for this reason, I gravitated strongly toward reading. Starting from the age of six, I spent hours a day reading fiction. I found many of the stories that I read to be emotionally compelling, and identified with the characters.</p>\n<p>My interest is altruism is largely <em>literary</em> in origin \u2014 I perceive the sweep of history to be a story, and I want things to go well for the characters, and want the story to have a happy ending. I was influenced both by portrayals of sympathetic, poor characters in need, and by stories of the triumph of the human spirit, and I wanted to help the downtrodden, and contribute to the formation of peak positive human experiences.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I sometimes wonder whether there are other people with altruistic tendencies that are literary in origin, and whether they would be good candidate members of the effective altruist movement. There is some history of artists having altruistic goals. The great painter Vincent van Gogh moved to an impoverished coal mine to <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/vincent-van-gogh-9515695\">preach and minister to the sick</a>. The great mathematician Alexander Grothendieck gave <a href=\"http://www.ams.org/notices/200410/fea-grothendieck-part2.pdf\">shelter to the homeless</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"An_analytical_bent__and_utilitarianism\">An analytical bent, and utilitarianism</h2>\n<p>When I was young, I had vague and dreamy hopes about how I might make the world a better place. As I grew older, I found myself more focused on careful reasoning and rationality.</p>\n<p>In high school, I met <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2010/06/03/my-donation-for-2009-guest-post-from-dario-amodei/\">Dario Amodei</a>, who introduced me to utilitarianism. The ethical framework immediately resonated with me. For me, it corresponded to valuing the well being of all characters in the story \u2014 a manifestation of <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.blogspot.com/2013/01/mr-rogers-on-unconditional-love.html\">universal love</a>.</p>\n<p>This was the birth of my interest in maximizing aggregated global welfare. Maximizing aggregated global welfare corresponds to maximizing cost-effectiveness, and so this can be thought of as the origin of my interest in <em>effective</em> altruism.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I believe that I would have developed interest in global welfare, and in effective altruism, on my own accord, without encountering any members of the effective altruist movement. But for reasons that I describe below, if not for meeting these people, I don\u2019t think that my interests would have been actionable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Epistemic_paralysis\">Epistemic paralysis</h2>\n<p>My analytical bent had a downside.</p>\n<p>Issues pertaining to the human world are very complex, and there aren\u2019t clear-cut objective answers to the question of how best to make the world a better place. On a given issue, there are many arguments for a given position, and many counterarguments to the arguments, and many counterarguments to the counterarguments, and so on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Contemplating these resulted in my falling into a state of <a href=\"http://squid314.livejournal.com/350090.html\">epistemic learned helplessness</a>. I became convinced that it's not possible to rationally develop confidence in views concerning how to make the world a better place.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Enter_GiveWell\">Enter GiveWell</h2>\n<p>In 2007, my college friend <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/116-interview-with-brian-tomasik\">Brian Tomasik</a> pointed me to GiveWell. At the time, GiveWell had just launched, and there wasn\u2019t very much on the website, so I soon forgot about it.</p>\n<p>In 2009, my high school friend Dario, who had introduced me to utilitarianism, pointed me to GiveWell again. By this point, there was much more information available on the GiveWell website.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I began following GiveWell closely. I was very impressed by the fact that co-founders Holden and Elie seemed to be making sense of the ambiguous world of effective philanthropy. I hadn\u2019t thought that it was possible to reason so well about the human world. This made effective altruism more credible in my eyes, and inspired me. If hadn\u2019t encountered GiveWell, I may not have gotten involved with the effective philanthropy movement at all, although I may have become involved through interactions of Less Wrong, and I may have gone on to do socially valuable work in <a href=\"http://www.mathisbeauty.org\">math education</a>.</p>\n<p>I became progressively more impressed by GiveWell over time, and wanted to become involved. In 2011, I did volunteer work for GiveWell, and in 2012, I began working at GiveWell as a research analyst.</p>\n<p>While working at GiveWell, I learned a great deal about how to think about philanthropy, and about epistemology more generally. A crucial development in my thinking was the gradual realization that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cost-effectiveness estimates that are supported by a single line of evidence are unreliable.</li>\n<li>Investigation generally reveals that interventions that appear highly cost-effective relative to other interventions are often much worse (in a relative sense) than one would initially guess.</li>\n<li>One can become much more confident in one\u2019s assessment of the value of a philanthropic intervention by <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/11/10/maximizing-cost-effectiveness-via-critical-inquiry/\">examining it from many different angles</a>.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I wrote about this realization in my post <a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/hif/robustness_of_costeffectiveness_estimates_and/\">Robustness of Cost-Effectiveness Estimates and Philanthropy</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This shift in my thinking gradually percolated, and I realized that my entire epistemological framework had been seriously flawed, because <a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/lw/hmb/many_weak_arguments_vs_one_relatively_strong/\">I was relying too much on a small number of relatively strong arguments rather than a large number of independent weak arguments</a>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Many people had tried to explain this to me in the past, but I was unable to understand what they were driving at, and it was only through my work at GiveWell and my interactions with my coworkers that I was finally able to understand. The benefits of this realization have spanned many aspects of my life, and have substantially increased my altruistic human capital.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If GiveWell hadn\u2019t existed, it\u2019s very possible that I wouldn\u2019t have learned these things. If Dario hadn\u2019t pointed me to GiveWell, I\u2019m sure that I would have encountered GiveWell eventually, but it may have been too late for it to be possible for me to work there, and so I may not have had the associated learning opportunities.</p>\n<p>My involvement with GiveWell also facilitated my meeting <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/05/guest-post-from-vipul-naik/\">Vipul Naik</a>, the founder of <a href=\"http://openborders.info/\">Open Borders</a>. We\u2019ve had many fruitful interactions related to maximizing global welfare, and if I hadn\u2019t met him through GiveWell, it may have been years before we met.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_significance_of_Less_Wrong\">The significance of Less Wrong</h2>\n<p>Several people pointed me to Overcoming Bias and <a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com\">Less Wrong</a> starting in 2008, but at the time the posts didn\u2019t draw me in relative to the fascination of <a href=\"http://www.mathisbeauty.org/preludereciprocitylaws.pdf\">reciprocity laws in algebraic number theory</a>. In early 2010, Brian Tomasik pointed me to some of <a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/6ga/index_of_yvains_excellent_articles/\">Yvain\u2019s articles</a> on Less Wrong. With the background context of me following GiveWell, Yvain\u2019s posts on utilitarianism really resonated with me. So I started reading Less Wrong.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I met many impressive people who are seriously interested in effective altruism through Less Wrong. Among these are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/nbeckstead/\">Nick Beckstead</a> \u2014 A new postdoc at Oxford University (specifically, the <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">Future of Humanity Institute</a>) who wrote the thesis <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/nbeckstead/research\">On the Overwhelming Importance of Shaping the Far Future</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/user/paulfchristiano/overview/\">Paul Christiano</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/user/jsteinhardt/overview/\">Jacob Steinhardt</a> \u2014 graduate students in theory of computing and machine learning at Berkeley and Stanford (respectively). Jacob is a <a href=\"http://www.hertzfoundation.org/dx/fellows/fellow_profile.aspx?d=1205\">Hertz Fellow</a>, and Paul coauthored a 48 page paper titled <a href=\"http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1203.4740\">Quantum Money from Hidden Subspaces</a> as an undergraduate. Paul <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/\">has thought a great deal about rational altruism,</a> and Jacob is a member of <a href=\"http://www.vannevargroup.org/\">The Vannevar Group</a>, which aims to accelerate scientific progress to create the greatest amount of social good.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://math.berkeley.edu/~qchu/\">Qiaochu Yuan</a> \u2014 A math graduate student at Berkeley who has the <a href=\"http://mathoverflow.net/users/290/qiaochu-yuan\">sixth highest karma score on MathOverflow</a>. I\u2019ve been enjoying learning math from Qiaochu.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/user/CarlShulman/overview/\">Carl Shulman</a> and <a href=\"http://rationality.org/about/\">Dan Keys</a>. I\u2019ve found very intellectually stimulating and have learned a great deal from them.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lukeprog.com/\">Luke Muehlhauser</a> \u2014 The executive director of MIRI.</li>\n<li>Others \u2014 Including Julia Galef, Anna Salamon, Katja Grace, Louie Helm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They\u2019ve helped me retain my motivation to do the most good, and have aided me in thinking about effective altruism. They constitute a substantial chunk of the most impressive people who I know in my age group.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s genuinely unclear whether I would have gotten to know these people if Eliezer hadn\u2019t started Less Wrong.\u00a0</p>\n<h2 id=\"Closing_summary\">Closing summary</h2>\n<p>My innate inclinations got me interested in effective altruism, but they probably wouldn\u2019t have sufficed for my interest to be actionable. Beyond my innate inclinations, the things that stand out most in my mind as having been crucial are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dario introducing me to GiveWell</li>\n<li>Working at GiveWell</li>\n<li>Meeting Vipul through GiveWell</li>\n<li>Eliezer starting Less Wrong</li>\n<li>Meeting peers through Less Wrong</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Working at GiveWell substantially increased my altruistic human capital. I\u2019ve learned a great deal from the GiveWell staff, from Vipul, and from the members of the Less Wrong community listed above. We\u2019ve had fruitful collaborations, and they\u2019ve helped me retain my motivation to do the most good.</p>\n<p>The personal growth benefits that I derived from working at GiveWell are unusual, if only because GiveWell\u2019s staff is small. The networking benefits from Less Wrong are shared by many others.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I formerly worked as a research analyst at GiveWell.

As <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer\">Peter Singer</a> said in\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html\">his TED talk</a>, effective altruism \"combines both the heart and the head.\" The heart motivates us to be empathic and altruistic toward others, while the head can \"make sure that what [we] do is effective and well-directed,\" so that altruists can do not just\u00a0<em>some</em> good but\u00a0<em>as much good as possible</em>.</p><p>Effective altruists (EAs) tend to:\n</p><ol>\n\t<li><span><strong>Be globally altruistic</strong>:\u00a0</span><span>EAs care about people equally, regardless of location. Typically, the most cost-effective altruistic cause won't happen to be in one's home country.</span></li>\n\t<li><strong>Value consequences</strong>: EAs tend to value causes according to their consequences, whether those consequences are happiness, health, justice, fairness and/or other values.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Try to do as much good as possible</strong>: EAs don't just want to do <em>some</em> good; they want to do (roughly)\u00a0<em>as much good as possible</em>. As such, they hope to devote their altruistic resources (time, money, energy, attention) to unusually cost-effective causes. (This <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/\">doesn't</a> necessarily mean that EAs think \"explicit\" cost effectiveness calculations are the best <em>method for\u00a0figuring out</em> which causes are likely to do the most good.)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Think scientifically and quantitatively</strong>: EAs tend to be analytic, scientific, and quantitative when trying to figure out which causes <em>actually</em> do the most good.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Be willing to make significant life changes to be more effectively altruistic</strong>: As a result of their efforts to be more effective in their altruism, EAs often (1) change which charities they support financially, (2) change careers, (3) spend significant chunks of time investigating which causes are most cost-effective according to their values, or (4) make other significant life changes.</li>\n</ol>\nDespite these similarities, EAs are a diverse bunch, and they focus their efforts on a variety of causes.<p></p><p>Below are four popular focus areas of effective altruism, ordered roughly by how large and visible they appear to be at the moment. Many EAs work on several of these focus areas at once, due to uncertainty about both facts and values.</p><p>Though labels and categories <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/od/37_ways_that_words_can_be_wrong/\">have</a> <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html\">their</a> <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/alternative-truths/201005/why-its-dangerous-label-people\">dangers</a>, they can also enable <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)\">chunking</a>, which has benefits for memory, learning, and communication. There are many other ways we might categorize the efforts of today's EAs; this is only one categorization.\n</p><h2 id=\"Focus_area_1__Poverty_reduction\"><strong>Focus area 1: Poverty reduction</strong></h2>\nHere, \"poverty reduction\" is meant in a broad sense that includes (e.g.) economic benefit, better health, and better education.<p></p><p>Major organizations in this focus area include:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>\u00a0is home to the most rigorous research on charitable causes, especially poverty reduction and global health. Their current charity recommendations are the <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com/\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto\">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a>. (Note that GiveWell also does quite a bit of \"meta effective altruism\"; see below.)</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.goodventures.org/\">Good Ventures</a>\u00a0works closely with GiveWell.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\">The Life You Can Save</a>\u00a0(TLYCS), named after Peter Singer's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-You-Can-Save/dp/0812981561/\">book</a> on effective altruism, encourages people to pledge a fraction of their income to effective charities. TLYCS currently recommends GiveWell's recommended charities and <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/WheretoDonate.aspx\">several others</a>.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a>\u00a0(GWWC) does some charity evaluation and also encourages people to pledge 10% of their income effective charities. GWWC currently recommends two of GiveWell's recommended charities and <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/recommended-charities\">two others</a>.</li>\n</ul>\nIn addition, some well-endowed foundations seem to have \"one foot\" in effective poverty reduction. For example, the <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> has funded many of the most cost-effective causes in the developing world (e.g. vaccinations),\u00a0although it also funds less cost-effective-seeming interventions in the developed world.<p></p><p>In the future, poverty reduction EAs might\u00a0also focus on economic, political, or research-infrastructure changes that might achieve poverty reduction, global health, and educational improvements more\u00a0indirectly, as when\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform\">Chinese economic reforms</a>\u00a0lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty. Though it is generally easier to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of direct efforts than that of indirect efforts, some groups (e.g. <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/30/refining-the-goals-of-givewell-labs/\">GiveWell Labs</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.vannevargroup.org/\">The Vannevar Group</a>) are beginning to evaluate the likely cost-effectiveness of these causes.\n</p><h2 id=\"Focus_area_2__Meta_effective_altruism\"><strong>Focus area 2: Meta effective altruism</strong></h2>\nMeta effective altruists focus less on specific causes and more on \"meta\" activities such as raising awareness of the importance of evidence-based altruism, helping EAs reach their potential, and doing research to help EAs decide which focus areas they should contribute to.<p></p><p>Organizations in this focus area include:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a>\u00a0highlights the importance of helping the world effectively through one's career. They also offer personal counseling to help EAs choose a career and a set of causes to support.</li>\n\t<li>Explicitly, the\u00a0<a href=\"http://rationality.org/\">Center for Applied Rationality</a>\u00a0(CFAR) just trains people in rationality skills. But\u00a0<em>de facto</em>\u00a0they are especially focused on the application of rational thought to the practice of altruism, and are deeply embedded in the effective altruism community.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.leverageresearch.org/\">Leverage Research</a> focuses on growing and empowering the EA movement, e.g. by running <a href=\"http://www.effectivealtruismsummit.com/\">Effective Altruism Summit</a>, by organizing the <a href=\"http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/\">THINK</a> student group network, and by searching for \"mind hacks\" (like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci\">memory palace</a>) that can make EAs more effective.</li>\n</ul>\nOther people and organizations contribute to meta effective altruism, too. Paul Christiano examines effective altruism from a high level at <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/\">Rational Altruist</a>. GiveWell and others often write about the <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/11/the-moral-case-for-giving-doesnt-rely-on-questionable-quantitative-estimates/\">ethics</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/\">epistemology</a> of effective altruism in addition to focusing on their chosen causes. And, of course, most EA organizations spend\u00a0<em>some</em> resources growing the EA movement.\n<h2 id=\"Focus_area_3__The_far_future\"><strong>Focus area 3: The far future</strong></h2>\nMany EAs value future people roughly as much as currently-living people, and therefore think that nearly all potential value is found in the well-being of the astronomical numbers of people who could populate the far future (<a href=\"http://intelligence.org/files/AstronomicalWaste.pdf\">Bostrom 2003</a>; <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/nbeckstead/research/Beckstead%2C%20Nick--On%20the%20Overwhelming%20Importance%20of%20Shaping%20the%20Far%20Future.pdf\">Beckstead 2013</a>). Future-focused EAs aim to somewhat-directly\u00a0capture these \"astronomical benefits\" of the far future, e.g. via explicit efforts to <a href=\"http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdf\">reduce existential risk</a>.<p></p><p>Organizations in this focus area include:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li><span>The <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">Future of Humanity Institute</a> at Oxford University is the primary hub of research on <a href=\"http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdf\">existential risk mitigation</a> within the effective altruism movement.

{"date": "26th Jun 2013", "title": "What Is earning to give?", "author": "Peter_Hurford", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about a concept called \"earning to give\" and some effective altruists are doing it. But what is it?</p><p>Well, you know how some people talk about \"doing well by doing good\"? \"Earning to give\" is basically \"doing good by doing well\" -- you look specifically for a high paying job in order to earn a lot of money, and then use your large disposable income to donate to charity.</p><p>For instance, one might think to join a non-profit and do important work and earn a salary of $30K. Or, one might instead choose to become a banker or stock trader, earn $100K+, keep the same salary of $30K, and and donate the $70K+ and hire <i>two or more</i> charity workers to serve in their place. Chances are good that those two charity workers who displace you will do more good combined than you will have done if you worked in their place, and that you displaced someone who would have joined finance but not donated their money.</p><p>As Jeff Kaufman <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-03-11\">considers summarizing it</a>, the idea is to \"[g]ive money to the most effective charities, and maximize your impact by earning more and spending less.\" A basic introduction of this idea can be found in the <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give\">80000 Hours topic</a> and <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/faq#faq-what-is-earning-to-give\">corresponding FAQ</a>. Brian Tomasik also has a pretty thorough summary of the idea in <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/make-money.html\">\"Why Activists Should Consider Making Lots of Money\"</a></p><p></p><h2 id=\"Popular_press__objections__and_rebuttals\">Popular press, objections, and rebuttals</h2>\nThis idea has taken to popular press over the years, with <a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2011/11/banking-as-an-ethical-career/\">an article on Practical Ethics</a>, <a href=\"http://qz.com/57254/to-save-the-world-dont-get-a-job-at-a-charity-go-work-on-wall-street/\">Quartz</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-15820786\">BBC</a>, and recently <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/31/join-wall-street-save-the-world/?tid=ts_carousel\">The Washington Post</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2334682/Young-professionals-joining-Wall-Street-save-world.html\">Daily Mail</a>.<p></p><p>The Washington Post article in particular prompted people to write in some criticism, including <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?_r=1&amp;\">a column from David Brooks</a>. Brooks argues that (1) you risk losing your motivation and (2) you risk not living a sufficiently \"full\" life. Alexander Berger <a href=\"http://marginalchange.blogspot.ca/2013/06/2013-david-brooks-vs-2011-david-brooks.html\">responds</a>, pointing out that burnout is a risk, but the motivations of those people earning to give are definitely there and that they are living \"full\" lives.</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/349841/rise-singerians-reihan-salam\">objection in the National Review</a> that suggests \"earning to give\" favors individual action and ignores the good that can come from public action. This is <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/227-80-000-hours-in-the-washington-post-our-responses-to-the-coverage\">responded to by 80,000 Hours</a>, which says it's a political point being read that doesn't actually exist.</p><p>Ben Kuhn <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/etg-objections\">looks at more objections</a> that surfaced in the comments sections of various articles, and he finds that people object to (1) some \"earning to give\" careers (like banking) doing bad by promoting negative capitalist systems, (2) that where \"earning to give\" people are giving (mostly the <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com\">Against Malaria Foundation</a> ignores focusing on \"root causes\" in favor of addressing symptoms, and (3) general objections to utilitarianism. Kuhn addresses those arguments in that article.</p><p>Jeff Kaufman also looks at objections to banking as a career and <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-06-03\">proposes we talk about other careers instead</a>, like computer programming, teacher, or social worker. Julia Wise writes about <a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/whats-it-like-to-give-half.html\">how she could still \"earn to give\" on a $38K salary</a>.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"But_is__earning_to_give__actually_a_good_idea_\">But is \"earning to give\" actually a good idea?</h2>\nSo all this is great, and I'm glad there's a big conversation now on effectiveness and considering career choice as an ethical question. However, while the level of criticism I've seen in the popular press isn't great, there definitely are objections to \"earning to give\" that matter.<p></p><p><b>First, I think the issue of burnout is considered by those who think about \"earning to give\", but never directly addressed.</b> How many people pursuing \"earning to give\" end up burning out? And what happens then? Can one really choose <i>any</i> high-earning career and do well at it, or does one also need some sort of direct passion for the job?</p><p><b>Second, can't there be more beneficial careers than \"earning to give\"?</b> Generally, I agree with <a href=\"&lt;a%20href=\">80,000 Hours's response</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-03-02\">Jeff Kaufman's consideration</a> that \"earning to give\" is a <i>baseline</i>, not the best option. It's a useful and powerful point of comparison to ask \"Is what I'm doing better than just earning a higher salary and donating it?\".</p><p>Frequently, however, I think this baseline can be beaten. While there's a \"make more money to donate\" side of things, there's also a \"make the donated money work better\" side, working in the organizations themselves to increase the impact of each donation by increasing the impact of the organizations themselves. As Jeff Kaufman records in <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-05-20\">\"Talent or Money\"</a>, some organizations like <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org\">Giving What We Can</a> probably would benefit more from additional talent than additional money. In <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/node/31\">\"Earning to Give vs. Altruistic Career Choice Revisited\"</a>, Jonah Sinick discusses that consideration among a few others.</p><p>Overall, the career you choose is an incredibly important choice to consider not just from a personal perspective, but from an ethical perspective. But it's also a very individual choice and the good one can do with their career and the satisfaction they can get out of it depend immensely on one's individual talents and desires. Therefore, a would-be career do-gooder should instead try to find individualized advice (such as that offered by <a href=\"http://www.80000hours.org\">80000 Hours</a>) and consider a wider variety of careers.</p><p><em>An earlier version of this post appeared on <a href=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/sunday-links-4-earning-to-give/\">Everyday Utilitarian</a></em></p></div></div>"},

People compare themselves favorably or unfavorably to others in their social circles based on their wealth and their earning power, and signals thereof, and compare their social circles favorably or unfavorably with other social circles based on the average wealth of people in the social circles. Humans crave social status, and this is one of people\u2019s motivations for making money.</p>\n<p>Effective altruists attempt to quantify \u201camount of good done\u201d and maximize it. Once this framing is adopted, \u201camount of good done\u201d becomes a measure of social status in the same way that money is. Most people who aspire to be effective altruists will be partially motivated by a desire to matter more than other people, in the sense of doing more good. People who join the effective altruism movement may do so partially out of a desire to matter more than people who are not in the movement.</p>\n<p>Harnessing status motivations for the sake of doing the most good can have profound positive impacts. But under this paradigm, <em>effective altruists will generally be motivated to believe that they\u2019re doing more good than other people are</em>. This motivation is not necessarily dominant in any given case, but it\u2019s sufficiently strong to be worth highlighting.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, note that <em>effective altruists will be motivated to believe that the activities that they themselves are capable of engaging in have higher value than they actually do, and that activities that others are engaged in have lower value than they actually do. Without effort to counterbalance this motivation, effective altruists\u2019 views of the philanthropic landscape will be distorted, and they\u2019ll be apt to bias others in favor of the areas that use their own core competencies.</em></p>\n<p>I worry that the effective altruist community hasn\u2019t taken sufficient measures to guard against this issue. In particular, I\u2019m not aware of any overt public discussion of it. Independently of whether or not there are examples of public discussion that I\u2019m unaware of, the fact that I\u2019m not aware of any suggests that any discussion that has occurred hasn\u2019t percolated enough.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ll refrain from giving specific examples that I see as causes for concern, on account of political sensitivity. The effective altruist community is divided into factions, and <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/\">Politics is the Mind-Killer</a>. I believe that there are examples of each faction irrationally overestimating the value of their activities, and/or irrationally undervaluing the value of other faction's activities, and I believe that in each case, motivated reasoning of the above type may play a role.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"I_request_that_commenters_not_discuss_particular_instances_in_which_they_believe_that_this_has_occurred__or_is_occurring__as_I_think_that_such_discussion_would_reduce_collaboration_between_different_factions_of_the_effective_altruist_community_\">I request that commenters not discuss particular instances in which they believe that this has occurred, or is occurring, as I think that such discussion would reduce collaboration between different factions of the effective altruist community.</strong></p>\n<p>The effective altruist movement is in early stages, and it\u2019s important to arrive at accurate conclusions about effective philanthropy <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/43-the-haste-consideration\">as fast as possible</a>. At this stage in time, it may be that the biggest contribution that members of the community can make is to engender and engage in an honest and unbiased discussion of how best to make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>I don't have a very definite proposal for how this can be accomplished. I welcome any suggestions. For now, I would encourage effective altruist types to take pride in being <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/dyk/selfskepticism_the_first_principle_of_rationality/\">self-skeptical</a>\u00a0when it comes to favorable assessments of their potential impact relative to other effective altruist types, or relative to people outside of the effective altruist community.</p>\n<p><strong>Acknowledgements: </strong> Thanks to Vipul Naik and Nick Beckstead for feedback on an earlier draft of this post..</p><p></p><p></p></div>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>I formerly worked as a research analyst at GiveWell.

{"date": "17th Jun 2013", "title": "Using time effectively as a student", "author": "Katja_Grace", "num_comments": "1 comment", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>When I was at college, many of my associates had part time jobs, or worked during school breaks. The jobs were often unpleasant, uninspiring, and poorly paid ones, such as food preparation. Some were better, such as bureaucracy. But they were generally much worse than any of the jobs we would expect to have after graduating. I think this is normal.</p><p>It was occasionally suggested that I too should become employed. This seemed false to me, for the following reasons. There are other activities I want to spend a lot of time on in my life, such as thinking about how to make the world better. I expect the nth hour of thinking to be roughly as valuable regardless of when it happens. If I think for a hundred extra hours this year, or a hundred extra hours in five years, I still expect to have about the same amount of understanding at the end, and for hours in ten years to be about as valuable either way.</p><p>Depending on what one is thinking about, moving hours of thinking earlier might make them more valuable. Understanding things early on probably adds value to other activities, and youth is purportedly a bit helpful for thinking. Also a better understanding early on probably makes later observations (which automatically happen with passing time) more useful.</p><p>This goes for many things. Reading, learning various skills, writing. Some things are arguably even more valuable early on in life, such as making friends, gaining respect, and figuring out efficient lifestyle logistics.</p><p>Across many periods of time, work is roughly like this. It is the total amount of work you do that matters. But between before and after graduating, this is not so! An hour of work is worth a lot more to you after you can get a well paid and highly productive job.</p><p>Suppose I want to do some of activity A and some of activity B. If activity A is a lot more valuable in the future, and activity B is about as valuable now or in the future, all things equal I should trade them and do B now, if I can.</p><p>One might retort that work before graduating will get you a better wage after graduating. However, so will the same amount of work after graduating, and it will be paid more at the time. Yes, you will be a year behind say, but you will have done something else for a year that you no longer need to do in the future.</p><p>Work makes a lot of sense if you have pressing needs for money now and no ability to borrow, or a strong aversion to indebtedness. My guess is that the latter played a large part in others\u2019 choices. When I was at school in Australia, most youth whose families weren't wealthy could get enough money to live on from the government, and anyone could defer paying tuition until they had a good income later.</p><p>It seems that college students generally treat their time as low value. Not only do they work for low wages, but they go to efforts to get free food, and are happy to spend an hour of three people\u2019s time to acquire discarded furniture they wouldn\u2019t spend a hundred dollars on. This seems to mean they don\u2019t think these activities they could do at any time in their life are valuable. If you are willing to trade an hour you could be reading for $10 worth of value, you don\u2019t value reading much. When these people are paid a lot more, will they give up activities like reading all together? If not, it seems they think reading is also more valuable in the future than now, and the relative values are jumping roughly in line with the value of working at these times. Or that the value of reading diminishes on very short time scales, so regardless of the value of the alternatives being traded against it at different points, it is valuable to do a little every week (like eating). This seems unlikely, but perhaps I am missing something. I posit that students should value their time roughly as highly before graduating as after, as long as they have activities they consider as valuable as work to do at some point in their lives, which they can trade in to do before graduating without much loss.</p></div></div>"},

{"date": "24th Jun 2013", "title": "The rules of effective altruism. Rule #1: don\u2019t die", "author": "William_MacAskill", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Effective altruists (EAs) should have a very different attitude to risks of death than egoists (whether or not the egoist is effective or ineffective).</p><p>Consider the decision to go hang gliding. Going hang gliding has 8 micromorts per trip \u2014 that is, if you go hang gliding, there\u2019s a 1 in 125,000 chance that you\u2019ll die. And, if you expect to live 50 more years, taking 1 in 125,000 means losing 210 minutes of expected life.  So if you\u2019re an egoist you might reasonably think: \u201cWell, it sucks to lose 210 minutes of expected life, but it would be really fun to go hang gliding, I\u2019d have great memories, and so on, so I\u2019m willing to make the trade off\u201d and then jump off a cliff. (Attached to a hang glider, of course.)</p><p>However, if you\u2019re an EA, then it\u2019s not just your life on the line. If you\u2019re doing well, you should expect to save tens, hundreds, and maybe even thousands of lives over the course of your lifetime--or to do an equivalent amount of good.  (I actually think that the amount of good you can do is far more than the value of saving hundreds of lives, but that requires argument and clarification, so I\u2019ll leave it for another time). So if you die young, all those lives are lost.</p><p>Let\u2019s suppose, then, that you expect to save 100 lives over the course of your future life. Given that, hang gliding doesn\u2019t look so attractive. The amount of fun from gliding will stay the same, let\u2019s suppose. But the cost is much greater. In fact, it\u2019s more than a hundred times greater: by hang gliding you create a 1 in 125,000 chance of dying, and you create this chance for the 100 people you would save as well. This brings the total expected loss of life to 21,200 minutes, or two weeks of life. If thinking just in terms of self-interest, would you take a roughly one in 1,000 chance of death, losing two expected weeks of life, for the fun of hang gliding? Probably not. And if not, then you shouldn't take that benefit to yourself when it's other people's lives on the line either. So, to a very first approximation, as an EA you shouldn\u2019t go hang gliding. In general, EAs should be much more concerned about their own survival than they might intuitively be inclined to be.</p><p>(NB: there\u2019s much more to say on this issue, including: weighing risks of death that save you time; risks that make you more productive; and looking into which particular activities are too risky to be worth it, and which are ok. I\u2019ll elaborate in further posts.)\n</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "17th Jul 2013", "title": "Why it should be easy to dominate GiveWell\u2019s recommendations", "author": "Robert_Wiblin", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>GiveWell\u2019s charity <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">recommendations</a> \u2013 currently Against Malaria Foundation, GiveDirectly and the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative \u2013 are generally regarded as the most reliable in their field. I imagine many readers here donate to these charities. This makes it all the more surprising that it should be pretty easy to start a charity more effective than any of them.</p>\n<p>All you would need to do is found an organisation that fundraises for whoever GiveWell recommends, and raises more than a dollar with each dollar it receives. Is this hard? <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/48-fundraising-for-charity-a-career-for-effective-altruists\">Probably</a> <a href=\"http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=595\">not</a>. As a general rule, a dollar spent on fundraising seems to raise at least several dollars. It\u2019s a pretty simple and fast multiplier that obviously beats putting your money in the stock market. An independent organisation raising money for GiveWell\u2019s top charities should do even better than a typical fundraiser, thanks to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the strength of evidence, which is especially compelling to big donors</li>\n<li>the independent recommendation, which looks particularly credible and removes the perception of any ulterior motive</li>\n<li>a willingness to maximise (for example by targeting the wealthy, and focussing on regular or legacy donors)</li>\n<li>an intrinsic motivation to do good</li>\n<li>the freedom to choose which of the three organisations they promote, depending on who they are talking to.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Putting your money into fundraising, rather than just giving it directly, does impose additional costs on the donors you inspire, and may \u2018crowd out\u2019 gifts to other charities. However, the logic of giving to GiveWell\u2019s top rated charities is that they make (much) better use of money than most other individuals or organisations. So if you have a fundraising ratio significantly above 1:1, these downsides shouldn\u2019t much matter.</p>\n<p>You might ask: if fundraising is the best thing to do, why wouldn\u2019t AMF, SCI or GiveDirectly just spend the money you give them on fundraising? My guess is that it\u2019s simply a bad look. If they spend too much on fundraising, it will irrationally scare off their existing and potential donors. Even if a charity should ideally spend most of its receipts on further fundraising in order to grow more quickly, the option simply isn\u2019t available. The social norm against \u2018<a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising\">optimising fundraising</a>\u2018 is generally helpful, because intense competition between charities for donations would cause \u2018rent dissipation\u2019, and less total money would flow to charity recipients. But if your charity actually <em>is</em> much better than other charities, and so it\u2019s good when you \u2018take\u2019 their money, this social norm does harm by preventing you from doing so.</p>\n<p>So, if you are <a href=\"http://robertwiblin.com/2012/04/06/the-principle-of-altruistic-arbitrage/\">unlike most donors</a> and <em>are</em> willing to have your money spent on effective fundraising, you can easily increase your impact several times over. Just help GiveWell\u2019s top charities take their fundraising efforts \u2018off the books\u2019 by founding or giving to a separate organisation that does it for them.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t actually an impractical plan. Starting up a lean and effective fundraising organisation is difficult, but much easier than building a global team to distribute insecticide-treated bed nets. Any bright and energetic person in a rich country who went and received the necessary training would have a decent shot at getting such an organisation off the ground. If you would like to discuss the first steps required to make this happen, drop me an email (robertwiblin [at] gmail [dot] com) and I can put you in touch with a team already working on this approach, who could direct you towards legal and financial support.</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "24th Jul 2013", "title": "Counterfactual credit assignment", "author": "Brian_Tomasik", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p></p><h2 id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</h2>\nEffective altruists tend to assign credit based on counterfactuals: If I do X, how much better will the world be than if I didn't do X? This is the intuition behind the idea that the work you do in your job is at least somewhat <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/make-money.html\">replaceable</a>, as well as the reason to seek out do-gooding activities that aren't likely to be done without you.\n<h2 id=\"Perils_of_adding_credit\">Perils of adding credit</h2>\nWe can get into tricky issues when trying to add up counterfactual credit, though. Let me give an example. Alice and Bob find themselves in a building that contains buttons. Each person is allowed to press only one button, at which point she/he is transported elsewhere and has no further access to the buttons. Thus, Alice and Bob want to maximize the effectiveness of their button pressing. There's a green button that, when pressed once, prevents 2 chickens from enduring life on a factory farm. There's also a red button that, when pressed twice in a row, prevents 3 chickens from enduring life on a factory farm. In order to make the red button effective, both Alice and Bob have to use their button press on it.<p></p><p>Alice goes first. Suppose she thinks it's very likely (say 99% likely) that Bob will press the red button. That means that if she presses the red button, she'll save 3 chickens, while if she presses the green button, she'll only save 2. There's more counterfactual credit for pressing the red button, so it seems she should do that. Then, Bob sees that Alice has pressed the red button. Now he faces the same comparison: If he presses red, he saves 3 chickens, while if he presses green, he saves only 2. He should thus press red. In this process, each person computed a counterfactual value of 3 for the red button vs. 2 for the green button. Added together, this implies a value of 3+3=6 vs. 2+2=4.</p><p>Unfortunately, in terms of the actual number of saved chickens, the comparison is 3 vs. 4. Both Alice and Bob should have pressed green to save 2+2=4 chickens. This shows that individual credit assignments can't just be added together naively.</p><p>Of course, the situation here depended on what Alice thought Bob would do. If Alice thought it was extremely likely Bob would press green, her counterfactual credit would have been 2 for green vs. 0 for red. Or, if she thought Bob would switch to red if and only if she pressed red, then the comparison was 2 for herself vs. 3-2=1 for Bob's switching to red and giving up his green.\n</p><h2 id=\"Joint_decision_analysis\">Joint decision analysis</h2>\nThe decision analysis becomes more clear using a payoff matrix as in game theory, except in this case both Alice and Bob, being altruists, share the same payoff, which is total chickens helped:\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>Bob press red</td>\n<td>Bob press green</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alice press red</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alice press green</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\nAlice and Bob should coordinate to each press green. Of course, if Alice has pressed red, at that point Bob should as well.<p></p><p>In this example, reasoning based on <i>individual</i> counterfactual credit still works. Imagine that Alice was going to press red but was open to suggestions from Bob. If he convinces her to press green and then presses green himself, the value will be 4 instead of 3 if he hadn't done that, so he gets more counterfactual credit if he persuades Alice to press green and then does the same himself than if he goes along with her choice of red.\n</p><h2 id=\"Acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h2>\nThis post was inspired by comments in \"<a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/43-the-haste-consideration\">The Haste Consideration</a>,\" which is a concrete case where counterfactual credit assignments can get tricky.<p></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "15th May 2013", "title": "An example of do-gooding done wrong", "author": "William_MacAskill", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>PlayPumps International was an immediate sensation. The idea was this: instead of the typical hand-pump, found in many developing-world villages to provide water for the community, PlayPumps International would install playground merry-go-rounds that would pump up water from deep underground as children played on them. The children would get often their first playground amenity, and the village would get clean water \u2014 it was a clear win-win.</p><p>Soon, Playpumps International was raking in awards and accolades \u2014 a $10 million grant from the US Government, announced by First Lady Laura Bush, a World Bank Development Marketplace Awared, and even a site visit and sponsorship from Jay-Z. The international media swooped in to report the story, loving both the startling innovation and the opportunity to pun on \u201cpumping water is child\u2019s play\u201d and \u201cthe magic roundabout\u201d. At the centre of it all was Trevor Field, the founder of PlayPumps International. He reported: \u201cIt really rocks me to know we\u2019re making a difference to a lot of people who are nowhere near as privileged as I am or my family is.\u201d</p><p>The only problem with PlayPumps International was that the idea wasn\u2019t actually any good. There were many problems, and I\u2019ll just mention a few.</p><p>First, unlike normal playground merry-go-rounds, which spin freely once they\u2019ve gained sufficient momentum, in order to pump water the PlayPumps needed constant force. The kids, understandably, would get tired very quickly, and didn\u2019t want to \u2018play\u2019 on the pumps at all hours of the day. So it would often be left to the women of the village, who would struggle to push the additional weight, and would sometimes vomit while the pump was in motion. In one town, children were actually paid by the locals to \u2018play\u2019 on the pumps.</p><p>The second problem was the lack of consultation and maintenance. When the UN investigated the efficacy of PlayPumps in Zambia, the majority of users said that they hadn\u2019t been asked whether they wanted the pumps and that they preferred the handpump that had been removed to make way for the PlayPump. Most didn\u2019t know who to contact in case the pump needed repair \u2014 which a large proportion of pumps did.</p><p>Finally, there was the cost. Though initially touted at $6500 per pump, the price rose without explanation to $14 000. Though that might not sound like much, that\u2019s equivalent to 64 years of local wages, and several times the cost of a standard handpump (which could also pump more water per hour). So donors were paying several times as much for a worse product.</p><p>In an interview prior to the public realisation that the PlayPumps program had been a disaster, Trevor Fields was asked what his one piece of advice would be. He said: \u201cThe best advice I\u2019ve ever received, ever, is to, and everybody says this, but it\u2019s true, believe in yourself. You\u2019ve got to believe in your idea\u2026 So the best advice that I\u2019ve ever got was that you\u2019ve just got to do it. It\u2019s like the Nike slogan. You\u2019ve just got to do it.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, when it comes to helping others \u201cjust do it\u201d and \u201cbelieve in your idea\u201d are probably the stupidest pieces of advice you could offer (rather than, say, \u201cdo your research\u201d). Luckily for the world, PlayPumps International was decent enough to admit it was game over and folded in March 2010.</p></div></div>"},

Here is a sequence of (hopefully decreasingly) naive ways to think about the impact of my decision.</p>\n<p>(I don\u2019t know if the later analyses are actually reasonable, but I\u2019d really like to see more intellectually serious discussion of this issue by people who understand the world, and particularly economics, better than I do. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if more sophisticated versions of this analysis are already well-understood amongst economists, and simply haven\u2019t been noticed by altruists trying to understand this issue. In that case, hopefully someone can point that out to me. Some of these analyses, and more sophisticated elaborations on them, appear in Ben Todd\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/1807196/Which_Ethical_Careers_Make_a_Difference_The_Replaceability_Issue_in_the_Ethics_of_Career_Choice\">masters thesis</a>.)<span></span><!--more--></p>\n<p><em></em><em>(Skip to section 6 if you want the punchline.)</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"1_\">1.</h2>\n<p>I should look at the direct consequences of doing job X, and choose a job for which those consequences are best.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2_\">2.</h2>\n<p>If I don\u2019t take job X someone else will. So I shouldn\u2019t be at all concerned with the immediate consequences of a job. Instead I should focus on the money I earn doing job X, which I will be able to spend at my own discretion (and which a substitute would have spent differently).</p>\n<h3 id=\"2b_\">2b.</h3>\n<p>I should also reason about other parts of the job which I might do differently from my substitute; for example, if I intend to sabotage a company, my substitute probably won\u2019t. If I will do a better or worse job than my substitute, that will also be relevant, etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3_\">3.</h2>\n<p>But when I take job X I slightly increase the supply of people who are willing to do job X, slightly decrease the wages for job X, and therefore slightly increase the amount of that job X that gets done. So I should compare the elasticity of supply and demand in this market to determine what will happen to the total amount of job X that gets done. (I think this is a standard calculation in basic microeconomics.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"3b_\">3b.</h3>\n<p>Markets aren\u2019t perfect spheres, and wages, demands, supplies, etc., will be slow and inconsistent in their reaction to an increase in supply. But if we look at the aggregate of many such decisions over a long period of time, this analysis should hold on average over many such decisions (and that should be good enough for our decision). Similarly, because workers commit to industries (for example by obtaining a degree in neuroscience) and industries commit to a number of workers (for example by investment in complementary capital) there is some necessary lag between an increased wage for job X and an increased supply. But over a long time period, on average, these effects seem to be neutral.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4_\">4.</h2>\n<p>In most industries the supply of labor is very elastic (because at equilibrium, if wages within an industry are lowered, people will instead take higher paying jobs elsewhere). Thus if I take job X, it will have little effect on the total amount of job X that gets done. So I should reason entirely about the money.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5_\">5.</h2>\n<p>But when I displace someone who would have done job X they take job Y, thus displacing someone else who goes on to take job Z. This process continues, each step having a small impact on wages, but the aggregate impact of many steps being unpredictable. To analyze the outcome we should appeal to a  simple equilibrium analysis: there is some supply of labor, and both before and after my introduction to the workforce, that supply of labor was being used roughly efficiently. So my impact is the same regardless of what job X is\u2014it is <i>as if</i> I were doing the most economically productive activity (on the margin).</p>\n<h3 id=\"5b_\">5b.</h3>\n<p>Incentives aren\u2019t defined in terms of economic productivity. For example, there may be philanthropists or governments funding activity in a domain. Then we need to adjust the analysis to say: my impact is <i>as if</i> I were doing the activity which is most rewarded on the margin.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5c_\">5c.</h3>\n<p>Different employees aren\u2019t perfect substitutes. I have my own set of skills, and the above analysis actually shows that I would be doing the most effective thing for a worker with my skills. So if I am a researcher, my impact will be to do the most  productive research.</p>\n<p>But of course it doesn\u2019t matter what my skills are, it matters what skills I am using\u2014the above analysis needs to be modified to take into account the fact that I might not pursue the most lucrative opportunity for someone with my skills. If I have a few different skills which don\u2019t often appear together, I can choose which of those skills to use (and therefore change my impact).</p>\n<p>However, if there are any laborers who were previously ambivalent between using those skills, then this effect will disappear. And if I can do either job X or job Y, in a large world it is very likely that others can as well. So I can actually have an impact only when everyone else faced with the choice between job X and job Y would definitely choose one or the other, i.e. when one of the jobs is less desirable than the other.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6_\">6.</h2>\n<p>But laborers differ in more ways than just their skills. The last consideration was actually a special case of the more general observation that laborers differ in terms of the <i>values</i> they have. In fact I am not alone in considering jobs based on more than just my anticipated compensation\u2014if I would choose job X over job Y because of altruistic considerations, there may be others who would do the same.</p>\n<p>What I am really doing when I decide to choose my job on the basis of altruistic concerns in addition to monetary compensation is changing the <i>aggregate demand</i> of laborers. In a world where all laborers made their decisions on the basis of only monetary compensation, the jobs that got done would be those that produced the most economic value. In a world where all laborers made their decisions on the basis of altruistic impact, the jobs that got done would be those that produced the most (direct) altruistic impact. In intermediate worlds, in which the labor force collectively makes its decisions on the basis of a combination of altruistic impact and economic value, the jobs that get done are those that are optimal according to that combination of values.</p>\n<p>Assuming that workers all value money enough that markets continue to function efficiently and facilitate (implicit) trade amongst people with different values, then my decision to base my job selection on a particular combination of money and other values serves to (slightly) change the collective values of the labor force, which in turn slightly changes which jobs get done.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6b_\">6b.</h3>\n<p>If my values are sufficiently unusual that I am taking jobs which no one else would consider, then the above analysis breaks down\u2014unless individuals can engage in explicit trade with one another, in which case it seems to go through (modulo uncertainty about bargaining outcomes). This seems to be the role of money in the above picture.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Appendix_\">Appendix:</h2>\n<p>An analogous situation seems to obtain with respect to spending money, charitable or otherwise (and in fact in a broader set of domains). If I choose to spend my money to accomplish project X, others may also stop spending money on project X. The proper way to understand my spending seems to be as a change to the <i>aggregate demands</i> of people with money. If I am spending money on things that are good for me, then I\u2019ve shifted the notion of \u201ceconomic value\u201d to include things that are good for me. If I spend more money, I shift it farther. If I spend money on things that are good for future generations, then I\u2019ve shifted the notion of \u201ceconomic value\u201d to include things that are good for future generations.</p>\n<p>So if we are comparing job-related impacts of a career with donation-related impacts, it seems like we should be reasoning about the importance of shifting \u201cwhat people are willing to work for\u201d vs. \u201cwhat people are willing to pay for.\u201d I hope that this kind of framework can lead to a less brittle picture than we currently have.</p>\n\n<p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/\">Rational Altruist</a></em></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "18th Jun 2013", "title": "Giving now currently seems to beat giving later", "author": "Peter_Hurford", "num_comments": "1 comment", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Effective altruists are interested in doing as much as they can to make the world a better place, and many of them think donating their money as effectively as possible is a good way to do that. However, there is a debate among effective altruists whether one should either (a) donate a specific portion of one's income in small installments each year or (b) invest one's income and then donate as much as possible in one large lump sum right before death. Of course, there are other positions -- like donate every month or donate every decade, but in a very relevant sense the debate is between two options: \"give now\" vs. \"give later\".</p><p>In this essay, I will defend the \"give now\" camp and rebut the \"give later\" camp, thus explaining why I will continue to donate once a year, though think any sort of regular time period smaller than each year is probably also acceptable.\n</p><h2 id=\"But_first__why_give_later_\">But first, why give later?</h2>\nThe biggest champ for the \"give later\" crowd is Robin Hanson, who makes his view known most recently in <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2013/04/more-now-means-less-later.html\">\"If More Now, Less Later\"</a>:\n<blockquote>But at the margin, a person who saves another dollar, or chooses not to borrow another dollar, must typically expect the financial returns from their investments will help them more in the future than will such indirect effects of spending today. In fact, they should expect this savings will benefit their future self more than any of these other ways of spending today. After all, why give up money today if that both gives you less to spend today, and gives you less in the future? So there wouldn\u2019t be any savings, or less than maximal borrowing, if people didn\u2019t expect more gains later from saving than from spending today.<p></p><p>This implies that unless charity recipients are saving nothing and borrowing as much as they possibly can, they must expect that you would benefit them more in the future by saving and giving them the returns of your savings later, than if you had given them the money today, even after taking into account all of the ways in which their spending today might help them in the future. So there really must be a tradeoff between helping today and helping later; if you help more today, you help less in the future. At least if you help them in a way they could have helped themselves, if only they had the money.</p></blockquote>\nOr, more basically, there are two concepts:<p></p><p>First, there is the <b>\"growth rate\"</b> of donation -- by donating to a non-profit <i>now</i>, they get to do things with your money <i>now</i>, helping people immediately who then could be in a better position to give back, or by spending money on dreaded \"overhead\" (<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/16/which-of-these-boasts-is-not-like-the-others/\">which isn't evil, by the way</a>, but that's a matter for another time), putting them in a better position to grow <i>now</i>.</p><p>Second, there is the <b>\"investment rate\"</b> of saving/investing your donation money rather than donating now. This should be the easier of the two concepts -- you save your money, it grows in a certain percentage, and then right before you're about to die, you take all that money out and donate it.</p><p>And then to oversimpify the complex topic, you should be willing to donate now as long as you think \"growth rate &gt; investment rate\", and save now as long as you think \"investment rate &gt; growth rate\", plus a few other complications to be discussed.\n</p><h2 id=\"Ok__so_what_s_the_investment_rate__then_\">Ok, so what's the investment rate, then?</h2>\nFinding out the precise investment rate is complicated, but I think Jeff Kaufman has done some really good work on it in <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2013-04-06\">\"What Rates of Return Should You Expect?\"</a>. Basically, many sites suggest returns on investment between 6% and 12%, but this (a) ignores the average of 3% inflation, (b) involves cherry-picking, and (c) only focuses on US data. Articles like The Economist's<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21571443-investors-may-have-developed-too-rosy-view-equity-returns-beware-bias\">\"Beware of the Bias\"</a> point this out.<p></p><p>So if we're really optimistic, we could consider the investment rate to be 12% and if we're really pessimistic, we could consider it to be 0%, or lower! But I'd expect the real (inflation adjusted) rate of return on your investment to be between 3 and 5%. This means that if I had opted to instead take <a href=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/donations-report\">the $659.70 donation</a> I made last year and instead invested in it, given that I expect to live around 70 more years, I could realistically realize $5,372.94 to $21,687.36 if compounded monthly.\n</p><h2 id=\"Ok__so_what_s_the_growth_rate__then_\">Ok, so what's the growth rate, then?</h2>\nBut what about the other side of the coin -- growth rate from your donation? I see the potential size of this being huge. Unlike the investment rate which I think is overestimated, the growth rate seems <i>underestimated</i>.<p></p><p>Honestly, whatever the growth rate is on your donation is going to depend largely and entirely on <i>where</i> you donate. But if you're donating to advocacy, you could realize really large returns because of what's called <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/43-the-haste-consideration\">the haste consideration</a>:\n</p><blockquote>[I]magine two worlds:<p></p><p>(1) You don\u2019t do anything altruistic for the next 2 years and then you spend the rest of your life after that improving the world as much as you can.</p><p>(2) You spend the next 2 years influencing people to become effective altruists and convince one person who is at least as effective as you are at improving the world. (And assume that this person wouldn\u2019t have done anything altruistic otherwise.) You do nothing altruistic after the next 2 years, but the person you convinced does at least as much good as you did in (1).</p><p>By stipulation, world (2) is improved at least as much as world (1) is because, in (2), the person you convinced does at least as much good as you did in (1).</p></blockquote>\nEssentially, convincing just one person to do what you would do (go vegetarian, join Giving What We Can, etc.) as ardently as you would do it (or nearly as much) would have the same effect as your entire life's work. Robin Hanson stated the case for giving later over giving now as \"if more now, less later\".<p></p><p>But with the haste consideration, it's actually <b>if more now, more later</b>, because you'll be convincing people to do things they would otherwise have <i>not done at all</i> (presumably).</p><p>And you can donate money to convincing people -- by donating to <a href=\"http://www.veganoutreach.org\">Vegan Outreach</a> for veganism or <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org\">Giving What We Can</a> directly for donation outreach. I have tried to calculate the <a href=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/\">cost per converting a vegetarian elsewhere</a> and I'm told by Will MacAskill that, if I'm reading the spreadsheet he gave me right, it would cost an estimated $1779 to $4327 to acquire a new Giving What We Can member (I believe you can email him for details on that).</p><p>Thus, let's assume that, in my lifetime, I'll earn at least a $50K/year salary. Now assume that it costs a conservative $10K/year to recruit a Giving What We Can lifetime, committed member (who will also earn at least a $50K/year salary). I can either do two things:</p><p>(1) invest 10% of my salary each year at 5% return compounded monthly, and then, upon my death, buy as many committed GWWC members as possible.\n(2) donate 10% of my salary each year to buy as many committed GWWC members as possible.</p><p>According to <a href=\"http://www.daveramsey.com/article/investing-calculator/lifeandmoney_investing/#/entry_form\">this investment calculator</a> (which I used earlier), option #1 will yield $3,200,782.84, which could buy 320 committed GWWC members.</p><p>Option #2 would add a committed member every two years, producing 45 committed GWWC members over my predicted 70 year lifespan. This looks bad, but now remember that each of those members would then get a chance to recruit new members using <i>their</i> money. The first person I get would then commit $340K of their own lifetime earnings over the remaining period (68 years, since I recruited them on year 2, at $5K/year contribution). I'd only need to recruit ten members myself to dwarf the investment strategy, and that's not even counting all the second-stage members <i>those</i> first-stage members recruit.</p><p>At this point, I wish I was a math major and knew how to calculate this out with a simple formula. Instead, I talked to a math major (who is also a GWWC member), and he mentioned that basically, the group effectively doubles over the two year period. I save up to $10K at year two and recruit someone, and then in two years (year #4) we both have $10K and recruit someone, and then in two more years (year #6) all four of us recruit have $10K and recruit someone each, bringing the total amount of people recruited to twelve. By year #70, I will have recruited, directly and indirectly, 1+2<sup>34</sup> people, or 17.1 billion new GWWC members.</p><p>Obviously, this is implausible because there aren't even 17 billion people and recruitment efforts would certainly be nonlinear. And there are other problems. But it's a simple way to prove the point. Hopefully this shows the benefit of compounding via the haste consideration to <b>recruit new people who wouldn't have donated their money otherwise.</b></p><p>Even if Option #1 were considered to recruit people who then saved all their money and recruited other people, by year #140 it would only have 102,400 people recruited, whereas Option #2 would have roughly 10<sup>41</sup> people recruited.</p><p>Even if the growth rate isn't 100% every two years, it's considerably higher than 5%, I think. Thus since growth rate &gt; interest rate, I advocate donating now. At least until someone finds the inevitable unobvious flaw in my thinking.</p><p>As Brian Tomasik argues in <a href=\"http://felicifia.org/viewtopic.php?t=824\">\"The Haste Consideration Reconsidered\"</a>, we'll probably hit diminishing marginal returns on GWWC recruiting soon, and thus should reconsider our donation target, re-evaluate the growth rate, and maybe shift back to investing rather than donating. But, <i>right now</i>, the prospects are still high and there are still many bright and active individuals who have not yet been recruited. Right now, we can use our money to make sure they use their money better.</p><p>Thus my answer to Robin Hanson: More (of our money) now, more (of their money) later. At least, while it lasts.\n</p><h2 id=\"Other_complications\">Other complications</h2>\n<i>Now time to explore some additional factors that may modify the consideration. The main argument has been made and this is is basically appendix material. Feel free to stop reading at this point, if you wish.</i>\n<h3 id=\"US_tax_law\">US tax law</h3>\nThis is an obvious factor to consider, but US law says that if you donate instead of invest, you can claim a deduction. This deduction would appear annually, thus allowing you to donate additional money. If you're earning the 50K I was talking about earlier, you'd be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States\">taxed at effectively 16.9%</a>. This would mean you could get back $845 on a $5K donation, assuming I understand tax law right.<p></p><p>If I donate $5K annually without investing, I'd actually be able to donate $409,150 over my seventy years rather than the original $350,000. If I had invested and then donated it all, I'd get $3,741,715.14 instead of $3,200,782.84.\n</p><h3 id=\"The_changing_nature_of_non_profits\">The changing nature of non-profits</h3>\nThere's a good chance that if Giving What We Can stopped receiving donations, it would just collapse and then the opportunity to donate to it in seventy years would be gone (though I suppose it could be refounded with the new cash). Additionally, GWWC couldn't learn from the seventy years of being able to operate, spend money, and try things.<p></p><p>And GWWC seems to be in a prime place right now to expand a lot and really grow it's outreach. Thus it's at a critical time to fund when the marginal cost to recruit a new member is at probably some of the lowest it will be. Now, not in seventy years, is a great time to get in.</p><p>Furthermore, I speculate that the marginal value will grow at a rate higher than the interest, such that $5K/year for seventy years would buy more members for GWWC than a flat $3.7 million in seventy years would.</p><p><span>You might be smarter in the future</span></p><p>There's a good chance there might be better giving opportunities in seventy years, identified through our collective greater intelligence, your years of added experience, and the changing world (though <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/20/give-now-or-give-later/\">GiveWell disagrees</a>, <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/our-research/donating-vs-investing\">as does GWWC</a>). This could mean it is better to give later, because you could be donating to an overall higher impact opportunity.\n</p><h3 id=\"You_might_change_your_values\">You might change your values</h3>\nSome people are concerned that if they stored their donation money for seventy years, their future self might not care to donate it anymore. Personally, the way I view my personal identity, I'd rather have done what my future self wanted me to do, so if my future self seventy years from now wished I would have been less altruistic, I want to be less altruistic now, so I don't see this as a concern. But if you do, you should donate now, before your future self has a chance to redirect the money.<p></p><p>One way to protect from this might be to use a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donor_advised_fund\">donor advised fund</a>, which would also get the benefit of more charity deductions (since you can deduct each contribution to your fund) and your future wisdom while forcing your future self to donate.\n</p><h3 id=\"Better_advocacy\">Better advocacy</h3>\nIt seems much easier to convince someone to give a little each year than to follow a solid savings plan -- as Scott Alexander states, there <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/05/investment-and-inefficient-charity/\">are some strange psychological effects</a> that make us feel strongly like giving now and giving regularly is better, and we can secure the warm fuzzies feelings and social status of being considered a regular donor.<p></p><p>Moreover, if you convinced a friend to donate, you'd know much more immediately if they actually plan on sticking to it if you can see a donation they make in December rather than having to wait until they die. (Though I suppose this too could be solved by having them contribute to your donor advised fund, if they trust you a lot. But I imagine the average person wouldn't.)</p><p>Thus even if privately you should save, I think the best strategy to adopt publicly (when not speaking from an analytical point-of-view) is to encourage others to donate now.</p><p><i>An earlier version of this post appeared on <a href=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/giving-now-currently-seems-to-beat-giving-later/\">Everyday Utilitarian</a></i></p></div></div>"},

The case where this consideration applies robustly is when you\u2019re considering doing some risky activity X, which gives you a pure pleasure or happiness boost, or makes your life better in some way that doesn\u2019t affect your ability to do good.</p><p>The first case where this consideration applies in a mitigated form is where that risky activity X also benefits your productivity. For example, suppose that you have some medical condition that is interfering with your ability to work, and in order to cure it you need to undergo general anaesthetic. General anaesthetic has 10 micromorts, giving you a 1 in 100,000 chance of dying \u2014 not a sort of risk you want to take lightly. But if this condition really is affecting your productivity (and therefore your ability to do good), and you\u2019d be more than 0.001% more productive by curing your condition, then the expected value of curing the condition is positive.</p><p>The second case where this consideration applies in a mitigated form is where that risky activity X saves you time. Let\u2019s suppose that you can either drive or cycle to some destination 1 mile away. And let\u2019s suppose you\u2019re somewhere like Oxford where driving around the centre is slower than cycling. Cycling 1 mile creates 0.04 micromorts; driving one mile creates 0.005 micromorts. So, by the \u201cdon\u2019t die\u201d argument you might think that you should drive. But you\u2019ve got to weigh that against the good you do in the time saved. Let\u2019s suppose that you\u2019d save 10 minutes by taking the bike, which you would spend working. What\u2019s the cost of those micromorts? Let\u2019s suppose you\u2019ve got 50 more productive years, that you work 60 hours a week, 48 weeks a year. In which case the expected cost of cycling is (0.04/100000)*(50*60*48*60) \u2013 (0.005/100000)*(50*60*48*60) = 3 minutes.</p><p>So, to a very first approximation (and bearing in mind that these numbers are very sketchy!), it\u2019s worth it to cycle if it gives you more than 3 extra minutes of working time. I stipulated in the above case that cycling gives you 10 extra minutes of life. So, in that above case, you should cycle.</p><p>I say \u2018to a first approximation\u2019 because you should apply a discount rate: almost certainly, you should value giving yourself 1hr in the future either more or less than you should value giving yourself 1hr now. If your discount rate is positive (and you value time in the future less than you value time now), then comparing time saved against expected life lost due to potential death will overestimate the badness of the risk of death.</p></div></div>"},

Furthermore, it\u2019s a core conviction of mine that living an ethical and fulfilling life requires donating as much as one can spare to the best causes.</p>\n<p>But what are those best causes? The only honest answer is that I don\u2019t know. I think I have a good grasp of where the best causes <em>aren\u2019t</em>, but a lot more research has to be done by myself and others before I can feel confident giving anywhere. Therefore, I\u2019ve decided to donate very minimally and save my donations for later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"My_plan_to_learn_through_giving\">My plan to learn through giving</h2>\n<p>If anything is the core foundation of effective altruism theory, it\u2019s that causes can differ from each other in expected impact by <em>tremendous</em> amounts. The example of spending <a href=\"http://www.guidedogsofamerica.org/1/\">$42K on a guide dog</a> in the developed world versus spending <a href=\"http://www.hollows.org.au/\">$25 to cure blindness in the developing world</a> is very salient comparison to me, though <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2008/07/21/preventing-blindness/\">perhaps it is not completely fair</a>. There\u2019s also a concern echoed by Brian Tomasik that since we\u2019re uncertain about a lot of cause-and-effect relationships, <a href=\"http://utilitarian-essays.com/robustness-against-uncertainty.html\">what appears to be doing good might actually be a harm!</a> I therefore want to be pretty careful with how I donate even $1K, because that could be worth the same as millions of dollars elsewhere.</p>\n<p>This makes it a huge priority to learn more about opportunities for doing good, whether by donating or working. Thus, I\u2019ve decided to spend my money and time trying to figure out how to learn more in reliable ways and I\u2019m going to be slow to disperse money until I find ways I can reliably <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/10/obstacles-to-giving-as-consumption/\">invest that money</a> in learning. You can see the money I donate, as I donate it, on <a href=\"http://peterhurford.com/other/donations.html\">my donations page</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"What_is_my_plan__more_specifically_\">What is my plan, more specifically?</h3>\n<p>My current plan is to keep a line in my budget spreadsheet that specifies how much donations I \u201cowe\u201d, which currently will be 20% of my total income. Currently, I don\u2019t have any plans to earmark these donations in any other way, and they will just remain a part of my total investments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What_about_other_opportunities_\">What about other opportunities?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Why_not_a_donor_advised_fund_\">Why not a donor-advised fund?</h3>\n<p>If I keep up the plan of saving long-term, I will eventually get a donor advised fund for tax reasons. However, right now I am still a college student and I am not yet in a position where I need to worry about taxes. I\u2019m also not worried, at least in the short-term, about the traditional concern of values drift that a donor advised fund protects against.</p>\n<p>I also think there are two compelling advantages to keeping some donatable money outside of a donor-advised fund: (a) keeping the ability to move money to projects that do not have 501(c)3 status (something I expect to run into a lot, actually) and (b) keeping the ability to save money for myself, in case I want to <a href=\"http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/\">retire early</a> and work full-time on EA stuff.</p>\n<h3 id=\"What_about_GiveWell_\">What about GiveWell?</h3>\n<p>I have high trust and broad epistemic and methodological agreement with GiveWell. I normally look to GiveWell\u2019s recommendations as solid opportunities for doing good. However, this year, the recommendations available seem to be poorer than usual. As <a href=\"http://www.reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2013/12/off-cuff-thoughts-on-givewells-2013.html\">Carl Shulman points out</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/12/staff-members-personal-donations/\">GiveWell employees confirm</a>, this favors saving to wait for later.</p>\n<p>However, I still find GiveDirectly to be intuitively appealing and I\u2019m attracted to the relative simplicity of the model and using GiveDirectly as a way of spreading cost-effectiveness. Therefore, while I haven\u2019t personally put any money toward GiveDirectly, I\u2019ve <a href=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/what-id-like-for-my-birthday-and-christmas/\">asked for donations to GiveDirectly for my birthday and Christmas</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"What_about_GiveWell_Labs_\">What about GiveWell Labs?</h3>\n<p>I thus have strongly considered donating to GiveWell directly to help them, and have done so in the past. However, as of <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/06/28/givewell-and-good-ventures/\">their recent partnership with Good Ventures</a>, I believe them to now have all the funds they need to operate. GiveWell wishes to have <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/20/update-on-givewells-funding-needs/\">additional donations for diversification purposes</a>, so as to <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/09/17/balancing-support-from-good-ventures-vs-individuals/\">maintain their independence from Good Ventures</a>.</p>\n<p>However, I personally don\u2019t find this to be a compelling and urgent need. If the situation were that Good Ventures were withdrawing and GiveWell was going to scale back significantly, I would probably donate (depending on the reason for Good Ventures) splitting. But right now, I think there are more urgent needs and therefore I consider GiveWell to have no \u201croom for more funding\u201d. I intend to write more about this.</p>\n<p>Perhaps one can think of moving money to GiveWell Labs <a href=\"http://www.reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2013/12/donor-advised-fund-using-future.html\">as a donation to Good Ventures\u2019s future funding</a>, increasing the amount of money that is moved to future recommendations by GiveWell. This could be compelling given my broad trust about GiveWell, but right now I think it\u2019s generally more robust to wait and see what other opportunities I find, since (a) there\u2019s a risk that I might stop trusting Good Ventures / GiveWell, (b) I might run into a better funding opportunity that Good Ventures / GiveWell is not in a position to also fund, and (c) I don\u2019t yet get tax benefits on moving donations out of my investment account.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Are_there_any_other_groups_working_on_EA_learning_that_you_like_\">Are there any other groups working on EA learning that you like?</h3>\n<p>I\u2019m also watching closely the work of other organizations, like the <a href=\"http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">Centre for Effective Altruism</a> (CEA), the <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/\">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> (MIRI), the <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">Future of Humanity Institute</a> (FHI), <a href=\"http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org\">Effective Animal Activism</a> (EAA), and Brian Tomasik\u2019s upcoming Foundational Research Institute (FRI). All of these organizations seem focused on learning in potentially useful ways and I could see myself moving significant amounts of money to them.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I do not yet have enough detail on what these organizations are doing to learn and whether they are following methodologies for learning I would endorse and therefore I\u2019m not quite confident enough to give large sums of money to these organizations. Spending more time figuring out what these organizations are doing and spending more time figuring out what methodologies for learning I would endorse are top priorities for me going forward. Some aspects I\u2019m concerned about is whether good monitoring and evaluation procedures are in place to make sure progress is made. It\u2019s very easy to do things and not learn about them and end up spinning in circles, especially with theoretical work.</p>\n<p>But I\u2019m excited about 80,000 Hours\u2019s <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/246-our-progress-dec-2012-may-2013\">recent impact report</a>, Giving What We Can\u2019s <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/peterhurford.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxuYmVja3N0ZWFkfGd4OjEyNmI1Y2ZhMmUwYjk2ODk\">plan to focus on monitoring and evaluation for their pledgees</a>, and <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/2013/04/13/miris-strategy-for-2013/\">MIRI\u2019s commitment</a> to <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/2013/04/04/the-lean-nonprofit/\">\u201clean non-profit\u201d methodologies</a>.

And as we all know, a highly effectively altruistic thing to do is bring about more effective altruism. However, the optimal mixture of activities for promoting effectiveness is not identical to that for promoting altruism. They are upheld by different norms, and require different efforts to expand and arguments to proliferate. Which brings us to a need for prioritization. So, which is better: effectiveness or altruism?</p><p>By this I mean, which is the better recipient of marginal promotion effort?</p><p>For background, I\u2019m visiting the <a href=\"http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">Oxford</a> <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">Effective</a> <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Altruists</a> at the moment. Conversations here made it salient to me that my implicit views on this question have changed a lot since I was a teenager, and also differ from others\u2019 in the EA movement. So I thought I\u2019d lay them out.</p><p>When I was younger, I thought altruism was about the most promising way to make the world better. There were extremely cheap figures around for the cost to save a human life, and people seemed to not care. So prima facie it seemed that the highly effective giving opportunities were well worked out, and the main problem was that people tended to give $2 to such causes occasionally, rather than giving every spare cent they had, that wasn\u2019t already earmarked for something more valuable than human lives.</p><p>These days I am much more optimistic about improving effectiveness than altruism, and not just because I\u2019m less naive about cost-effectiveness estimates. Here are some considerations:\n</p><h2 id=\"Past_success\">Past success</h2>\nSo far, effectiveness has bought more than altruism for EAs, arguably. That is, giving an ordinary amount highly effectively will buy more good than giving a highly altruistic amount in an ordinary way. The difference between a normal amount of giving and a highly altruistic one is around 20x by my reckoning. I\u2019m not sure what the mean charity is, but my impression is that it is less than 1/20th as useful as the best things we know of. Better data on this welcome.<p></p><p>Furthermore, perhaps the quest for producing altruistic value can learn from the more popular quest to produce selfish value. There have been efforts both to encourage people to be more selfish (see <a title=\"Ayn Rand\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand\">Ayn Rand</a>) and to find cost-effective ways to direct selfish efforts. As far as I can tell, the former might even produce negative selfish value for people, whereas mankind has become reasonably good at finding selfishly valuable investments. But you might reasonably retort that the quest for selfish value has less to gain from changing values, given the ubiquity of selfishness. Also, selfish people have little reason to spread selfishness. The spread of useful understanding for prioritizing selfish actions is perhaps largely because information is reusable and hard to contain.\n</p><h2 id=\"Neglect\">Neglect</h2>\nEffectiveness is much rarer and altruism more common than I assumed when younger. <span>Altruism is actually done to extremes reasonably often. </span>Perhaps more importantly, pushing for effectiveness is much rarer than pushing for altruism. People are neither naturally very effective in their altruistic endeavors, nor driven to look for effectiveness and praise it in others. <span>Altruism on the other hand is universally liked, and celebrated in others. It is searched for on first dates, and praised at funerals. Quite a lot of effort has been put into encouraging it. </span>\n<h2 id=\"Room_for_more_funding__marginal_value_\">Room for more funding (marginal value)</h2>\nThere appear to be high value ways to encourage effectiveness, such as by doing or funding the research others need to be effective, and making it appealing to use. For instance, it seems that producing trustworthy prioritization of high level causes (e.g. poverty alleviation vs. technological progress) could easily produce more value from redirecting others\u2019 funds than one competent person\u2019s lifetime of giving to AMF, and I think would take less than one competent person\u2019s lifetime. So I think such prioritization is a better investment than AMF, which makes it a good investment.<p></p><p>In encouraging altruism, I don\u2019t know of any particularly promising directions. The most effective I have seen is probably <a title=\"Peter Singer\" href=\"http://https://www.princeton.edu/~psinger/\">Peter Singer</a>\u2018s method, of writing for a popular audience, encouraging readers to resolve their moral inconsistencies in favor of altruism. I\u2019m not sure if you can do such a thing again however; the low hanging fruit may be eaten, and Singer may have been especially well equipped to pick them.\n</p><h2 id=\"Upside\">Upside</h2>\nThere\u2019s only so altruistic a person can be, and the limit is within about an order of magnitude of where a lot of people are. We know what this would look like: about ten times better than what a <a title=\"Giving What We Can\" href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> member\u2019s achievements looks like. It seems on the other hand that there are much higher reaches of good prioritization that we haven\u2019t seen \u2013 it isn\u2019t clear how good the best visible opportunities could be, if we could spot them.\n<h2 id=\"Flow_through_effects\">Flow-through effects</h2>\n<h3 id=\"Effectiveness_probably_leads_to_altruism_more_than_the_other_way_around\">Effectiveness probably leads to altruism more than the other way around</h3><p></p><p>An intuitive story is that if a person really cared about helping, they would be naturally driven to find exceptionally good ways to do so. The fact that \u2018effective altruism\u2019 is a thing suggests this is not so, for whatever odd/cynical reason.</p><p>On the other hand, learning that one can can help others more cheaply than one thought, and having more confidence in the reliableness of the estimates producing this belief, seems to encourage altruism. People are moved by Peter Singer\u2019s story of the child in the pond in a way they would arguably <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/11/the-moral-case-for-giving-doesnt-rely-on-questionable-quantitative-estimates/comment-page-1/#comment-571415\">not be</a> if the passerby had to make a very substantial sacrifice and was less confident about the outcome of his action. On the other hand, on the way to improving effectiveness, we <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hif/robustness_of_costeffectiveness_estimates_and/\">often</a> learn that things are less effective than we thought, which will presumably undermine altruism by this reasoning.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"Economics_of_information\">Economics of information</h3><p></p><p>An abstract consideration in favor of expecting higher returns to encouraging effectiveness is that much progress on effectiveness is in the form of producing insights and other information, which can be shared, reused, and built upon.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"Effectiveness_is_more_valuable_when_applied_broadly\">Effectiveness is more valuable when applied broadly</h3><p></p><p>My impression is that in every part of the world, not just in philanthropy, better systems for assessing opportunities and making good decisions promise great gains. Altruism is not the only place where where contemporary efforts are primitive. Progress in prioritizing altruistic endeavors should often be applicable to this larger worthy project. Progress in effectiveness often comes with the accumulation of insights and other information, and information can be shared, reused, and built upon in a way that a pile of altruists can\u2019t be so well. If people weren\u2019t altruistic at all, but were basically cooperative (for selfish reasons), and they could discern of good policies from bad as perfectly as publicly available information would allow, I think this would make the world much better.</p><p>Altruism too appears to have many benefits outside of philanthropy. If people were more considerate of one another in general, they would avoid many harms from externalities and failures to coordinate. My sense is that within the plausible ranges of change however, these gains are smaller. If everyone was extremely well meaning but as just as uncertain about how best to act as we are today I would also expect things to go better but not nearly as much.</p><p>One thing that contributes to these intuitions is my impression that the difference in social effects between a person who is nice enough to have enjoyable relationships and one who is particularly kind at cost to themself is smaller than the difference in effect between a person who has a good sense of how to achieve what they want, and one who acts without regard to strategy.</p><p>This intuition also depends on one\u2019s answer to the question of why things go wrong in the world. Some ills are intentional malice, some are unchecked side effects of selfishness, and some are from ignorance and error. Altruism makes a dent on malice and selfishness, whereas progress in effectiveness diminishes the costs from ignorance and error.</p><p>I\u2019m inclined to think that ignorance and error make up a large part of the problem, though not obviously most. My guess is selfishness makes up most of the rest, and malice is small.</p><p>Naively, avoiding ignorance and error should be an easier sell: everyone wants their own choices to be better, whereas I\u2019d expect more hesitance about increasing their willingness to sacrifice for others. However after effort has been put into both, this may not be true on the margin. Also, there are many ways to make people more altruistic in effect that don\u2019t involve changing their values per se, e.g. arranging for them to feel better when they are being altruistic, or to have social support for it.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"Measurement\">Measurement</h3><p></p><p>Ironically, cost-effectiveness seems hard to measure. You can go by the current value for money estimate of your best cause, but this has <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hif/robustness_of_costeffectiveness_estimates_and/\">a tendency</a> to decrease as the quality of the estimate increases. This makes it a less good target for improvement, as it is harder to know when you are improving it, and easier for standards to decline without anyone noticing (this should go under the next section). On the other hand, there are relatively good (if imperfect) measures of altruism, such as \u2018what fraction of your income do you give to charity?\u2019.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"Long_term_durability\">Long term durability</h3><p></p><p>One last consideration is how changes in altruism and changes in effectiveness will last. I am not optimistic about changes in values lasting well. At first glance, if it was easy enough for you to shift others\u2019 values, you might expect them to shift again the next time someone pushes on them. Perhaps the situation is more complicated though. For instance, perhaps altruism is stickier than other values: it just inherently makes more sense, so once you have it you keep it. Or perhaps it spreads more easily: only altruists care about spreading their values to others. But in these kinds of situations, spreading altruism is still not as helpful as it looks, because everyone will end up there soon enough anyway.</p><p>The same goes for people valuing \u2018being effective\u2019 highly. However as I mentioned earlier, changes in effectiveness often involve insights that can accumulate. This makes it harder for progress to be completely reversed. Humans have come to not care much at all about hand-weaving, but still our accumulated insights on it mean that whenever anyone wants to weave stuff by hand, they can do it very effectively.</p><p>***</p><p>In summary, I think effectiveness is relatively neglected, though it has a better track record of success, more room for funding, better upsides, and produces better flow-through effects.</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "28th Feb 2013", "title": "Risk aversion and investment (for altruists)", "author": "Paul_Christiano", "num_comments": "6 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Suppose I hope to use my money to do good some day, but for now I am investing it and aiming to maximize my returns. I face the question: how much risk should I be willing to bear? Should I pursue safe investments, or riskier investments with higher returns?</p><p>My knee-jerk response is to say \u201cAn altruist should be risk neutral. If you have twice as much money, you can do twice as much good. Sure, there are some diminishing returns, but my own investment is <i>minuscule</i> compared to an entire world full of philanthropists. So in the regime where I am investing, returns are roughly linear.\u201d (I might revise this picture if I thought that I was a very unusual philanthropist, and that few others would invest in the same charitable causes as me\u2014in that case I alone might represent a significant fraction of charitable investment in my causes of choice, so I should expect to personally run into diminishing returns.)</p><p>But on closer inspection there is something fishy about this reasoning. I don\u2019t have great data on the responsiveness of charitable giving to market performance, but at the individual level it <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3083340\">seems</a> that the elasticity of charitable giving to income is about 1\u2014if I am 50% richer (in one possible world than another), I tend to give 50% more to charity. So in worlds where markets do well, we should expect charities to have more money. If markets (rather, the average investor) do 10% better, I should expect 10% more money to be available for any particular charitable cause, regardless of how many donors it has.<span></span></p><p>Of course, there is a difference between the market\u2019s performance and my portfolio\u2019s performance\u2014the funds available to a charity depend little on how <i>my</i> portfolio does, just how the <i>average</i> donor\u2019s portfolio does. So what is the relevance of the above result to my own risk aversion? Intuitively it seems that the performance of the market is correlated with the performance of any particular investor, but how tightly?</p><p>There is a simple observation / folk theorem that applies to this situation. Suppose two investors\u2019 portfolios are not perfectly correlated. Then (supposing those investors are earning the same returns) each would prefer to trade 1/2 of their portfolio for 1/2 of the others\u2014averaging two imperfectly correlated assets reduces the variance. In an efficient economy, this dynamic ensures that every investor\u2019s risk is well-correlated with the market. Any countercyclical assets will be absorbed into this ur-portfolio and invested in by every investor, thereby having the effect of reducing the variance of market returns.</p><p>There are many loopholes in this result, and markets are not perfectly efficient, but it provides an important intuition. If we have risky assets that are uncorrelated with (but have comparable returns to) the market, they will just be used to diversify portfolios and thereby become part of \u201cthe market.\u201d</p><p>So to first order, the fact that I am a small piece of the charitable donations to a cause shouldn\u2019t matter. My risk is well-correlated with the risk of other investors, and if I lose 10% of my money in a year, other investors will also lose 10% of their money, and less money will be available for charitable giving. This holds regardless of whether a cause has a million donors or just one.</p><p>The original question: \u201chow risk averse should I be?\u201d is now a question about the returns to charitable activities at a large scale. Clearly the first charitable donations will go to the best causes. How quickly does the quality of marginal charitable giving decline, as total charitable giving increases? This question is fundamentally specific to a cause. For most causes, there seem to be substantial diminishing returns. Some diseases are much easier to treat than others, some disasters easier to mitigate, etc. etc. However, it is worth keeping in mind the distinction between diminishing returns to money in the long-run and in the short-run. For example, if you have only thought of one good thing to do with $1M, your second million dollars would not do nearly as much good if you had to spend it immediately. But this isn\u2019t because the second million dollars is much less valuable than the first million in the long run, it\u2019s because the second million would be complementary with thinking that you haven\u2019t yet done. In the long run you can spend more time thinking about what to do with $2M now that you have it, and put it to a good use. It still won\u2019t be as good as the first million, but not as much less valuable as it appears in the short run.</p><p>The following are some important caveats and postscripts to this basic picture.\n</p><h3 id=\"Ordinary_investors_are_very_risk_averse\"><b>Ordinary investors are <i>very</i> risk averse</b></h3>\nI originally suspected that altruists should be risk-neutral because they are contributing only a small part to large projects, and therefore face roughly linear returns. By now I\u2019ve explicitly rejected that reasoning, but there is another reason that altruists might be interested in risky investments: ordinary investors appear to be <i>extremely</i> risk averse. Evidence of and explanations for the so-called equity premium puzzle are a bit tricky to untangle, but it <a href=\"http://www.commonfund.org/ei/2012%20EI%20Level%20I%20Prereading%20Material/Required%20Readings%20for%20Day%201%20-%20Monday,%20July%209th/Session%203%20-%20Long%20Term%20Global%20Equity%20Returns%20and%20the%20Equity%20Risk%20Premium/Rethinking%20the%20Equity%20Risk%20Premium%202011%20-%20CHAPTER%204.pdf\">looks like</a> there is a <i>big</i> premium on risk, such that risky equities earn annual returns a solid 3% higher than risk-free bonds.<p></p><p>If you have logarithmic utility, and estimate risk using historical data on the variability of equities returns, equities are a slam-dunk over safer investments, with risk-adjusted returns that are nearly twice as good. (This observation is the basis for the equity premium puzzle. The paper I linked suggests that the equity premium is smaller than you might naively estimate from US data, but it is still big enough to constitute a puzzle.) I think logarithmic returns are fairly conservative for altruistic projects (though perhaps not individuals\u2019 consumption), and that for most causes the payoffs are much more risk-neutral than that. So it looks like altruists ought to go for risky investments after all.</p><p>Moreover, I suspect (on priors) that altruists tend to invest as cautiously as other investors, and so it makes little sense for an altruistic investor to diversify their portfolio between equities and bonds even if there is a significant risk of collapse in equities (other altruists are doing the diversification for them).\n</p><h3 id=\"Some_risks_are_uncorrelated_with_the_market\"><b>Some risks are uncorrelated with the market</b></h3>\nThere are some opportunities which are risky but imperfectly correlated with the market (and sometimes nearly independent). For example, if you start or invest in a small company, your payoff will depend on that company\u2019s performance (which is typically quite risky but only weakly correlated with the market). In an idealized market this risk would be added to a larger portfolio of risks, but this often impossible due to moral hazard: if you received a paycheck that was independent of the success of your company, you would not be incentivized to run the company well, or to pick good companies to create or invest in. So no one is willing to sell you insurance in case your startup fails or your investment goes bad. The fact that you have to assume a big dose of risk is an unfortunate side-effect of this incentive scheme (and in a more efficient market we would expect angel investors and start-up founders to purchase more extensive insurance for various contingencies that would scuttle their enterprises but are clearly beyond their control).<p></p><p>To a normal person this risk is terrible, but to an altruist it should be considered a good opportunity (since other entrepreneurs and investors will tend to underprice such opportunities). See a discussion of this <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/12-salary-or-startup-how-do-gooders-can-gain-more-from-risky-careers\">here</a>, with some quantitative discussion.</p><p>This special case is only possible because the entrepreneur or investor is putting in their own effort, and moral hazard makes it hard to smooth out all of the risk across a larger pool (though VC funds will invest in many startups). You shouldn\u2019t expect to find a similar situation in investments, except when you are providing insight which you trust but the rest of the market does not (thereby preventing you from insuring against your risk).\n</p><h3 id=\"Prioritizing_possible_worlds_and_concentrating_investments\"><b>Prioritizing possible worlds and concentrating investments</b></h3>\nRisk-aversion is a special case of a more general phenomenon; a dollar is worth a different amount in different possible worlds. For normal risk-aversion, the issue is how much money <i>you</i> have in different possible worlds. A dollar is worth the most in the worlds where you are poorest. For altruists, the issue is how much money <i>charities</i> have in different possible worlds. A dollar is worth the most in the worlds where the least money is given to charities, and the largest number of attractive interventions go unfunded.<p></p><p>But there are other reasons that money may be more valuable in one possible world than another, which depend on which cause you actually want to support. Money aimed at helping the poor is most valuable in worlds where the developing world is not prospering. Vegan outreach is most useful in worlds where the meat industry is doing well, but vegetarian-friendly memes are prospering. Catastrophic risk mitigation is most valuable in troubled times. And so on. Each of these comparisons suggests an investment strategy; investors who care about cause X would prefer have money in worlds where it can be used to further cause X most efficiently.</p><p>Moreover, while ordinary risk averse investors are incentivized to construct a diversified portfolios, altruists have no such incentives. Though they should be concerned with risk, what they are really concerned with is the correlation between their risk and market returns. Thus they are not particularly interested in building a diversified portfolio, and it is particularly cheap for them to concentrate their investment in opportunities which will payoff in the worlds where they can best use money. Of course, this strategy becomes less attractive when very few people are interested in cause X, or when many of the investors interested in cause X are pursuing the same strategy\u2014those investors care about the correlation of their investment returns with each other, and <em>collectively</em> they do want to diversify their investments. If everyone who cares about vegetarianism goes broke in worlds where McDonald\u2019s folds, it is no longer the case that vegetarian dollars are less valuable in those worlds.\n</p><h3 id=\"Investing_for_the_long_haul\"><b>Investing for the long haul</b></h3>\nI <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/02/22/four-flavors-of-time-discounting-i-endorse-and-one-i-do-not/\">think</a> that altruists concerned about the far future should consider investing and earning market returns for as long as possible, before leveraging a much-increased share of the future economy to further their own interests. How does risk relate to this plan?<p></p><p>It seems most productive to think about the <i>fraction</i> of world wealth which an investor controls, since this quantity should be expected to remain fairly constant regardless of what happens economically (though will hopefully drift upwards as long as the altruist is more patient than the average investor) and ultimately controls how much influence that investor wields. A simple argument suggests that an investor concerned with maximizing their influence ought to maximize the <i>expected</i> fraction of world wealth they control. This means that the value of an extra dollar of investment returns should vary inversely with the total wealth of the world. This means that the investor should act as if they were maximizing the expected <i>log</i>-wealth of the world.</p><p>The recommendations for this setting (investing for the long haul) are therefore nearly identical to the earlier setting (investing to give). As in the earlier case, the apparent arguments for maximizing expected returns are faulty because it is bad to be correlated with the market. But nevertheless, the equity premium is large enough that investing in risky assets is still worth it. In fact in this case the issue is even more clear-cut, since there is little uncertainty about how risk-averse we should be when investing for the long haul.\n</p><h3 id=\"The_Kelly_Criterion\"><b>The Kelly Criterion</b></h3>\nThe Kelly criterion is a simple guideline for gambling / investing. The motivating observation is that, to maximize expected long-run returns, it is best to use a logarithmic utility function (because the total return after N periods is the geometric, rather than arithmetic, return during those periods). If we are directly concerned with logarithmic utility, we don\u2019t need to rely on this argument and should just use the Kelly criterion immediately.<p></p><p>The Kelly criterion recommends splitting your money according to the probability of a payout, rather than concentrating all of your money on the single best bet. (See also <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_matching\">probability matching</a>, which has been <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/alo/www/Papers/origin.pdf\">justified</a> on similar grounds.) In the case of investments, this corresponds to the following strategy (if we assume you have a negligible \u201cedge,\u201d or ability to predict tomorrow\u2019s market prices better than other investors). For each asset, estimate what fraction of the current world\u2019s <i>actual</i> wealth is stored in that asset, and invest that fraction of your bankroll in that asset. As prices change, reallocate your money to maintain the same distribution. (If the value of land doubles while the rest of the economy stagnates, such that you now have twice as large a fraction of your bankroll invest in land, then sell off half of your land). Of course, if other investors are following a similar rule, any price changes will be information about the long-run values of the underlying asset values, but this seems to be <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/06/dreamtime-finance.html\">far from true</a> in the real world.</p><p>Investors who support a rare cause and care about diversifying their own portfolio, should probably pursue something like a Kelly strategy. But as I\u2019ve said before, investors pursuing common causes don\u2019t care about diversifying their portfolios, and instead they should use their portfolio to pull the <i>aggregate</i> investments of philanthropists in line with the Kelly rule investments. This seems to mean going all-in on relatively risky assets.</p><p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/\">Rational Altruist</a></em></p></div></div>"},

Our response is that although the objection may be true for <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2009/12/14/charity-isnt-about-helping/\">typical examples of philanthropy</a>, when donors are <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">giving effectively</a> it\u2019s difficult for the expected harm to outweigh the good done by the donations.</p>\n\n<p>In this post, I make some very rough estimates of how harmful finance would have to be in order for it to outweigh the good done by the donations of someone Earning to Give to effective charities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"The_Direct_Harm\">The Direct Harm</h2>\n<br>\n<h3 id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n<br>\n<p>Left leaning advocates sometimes claim that Bill Gates did more harm through the Windows monopoly than good through his charity work. On the other hand, <a href=\"http://www.parapundit.com/archives/007256.html\">some on the right</a> claim that he did more good with Windows than with charity. Both views are implausible.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ll focus on the first claim, that the Windows monopoly did more harm than the Gates Foundation managed to do good, since this is the more common type of objection we find raised about Earning to Give. The vaccination programs of the Gates Foundation alone <a href=\"http://geekologie.com/2012/01/bill-gates-is-better-than-batman-the-inf.php\">are estimated</a> to have saved around 6 million lives to date, and this number is expected to rise significantly in the future. Windows has had <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-2001697/Microsofts-Bill-Gates-A-rare-remarkable-interview-worlds-second-richest-man.html\">800 million</a> users to date. This means that in order for Gates to have caused more harm through Windows, using Windows would have to be worse than making a person in poverty play a 1-in-100 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_roulette\">Russian roulette</a>. Microsoft might be annoying, but it\u2019s not that bad.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Zero_sum_games\">Zero-sum games</h3>\n<br>\n<p>What about other cases? It seems likely that many industries involve zero-sum elements, which use up human effort with creating value for society. For instance, it <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/2011/11/18/closing-wall-streets-casino/\">has been claimed</a> that certain types of financial speculation are just gambling. One side wins and the other side loses. No value is created. Similarly with corporate law, escalating amounts of resources are spent aiming to win cases, when mutual disarmament might deliver the same results without enormous legal costs. In both cases, it\u2019s tough to show that these industries actually create no value. Some level of speculation leads to more efficient markets. Some level of competition is probably required in order to have a functioning legal system. Even if we assume that they indeed do not create any value, that is not a robust enough argument to show that pursuing a legal career and doing significant effective philanthropy is net harmful; in order to make this case, one would need to show that the industry is causing harm on a large scale. Here are some calculations to show roughly how large the harm would have to be for such a claim to be substantiated.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Harm_outweighing_the_good_in_finance_\">Harm outweighing the good in finance?</h3>\n<br>\n<h4 id=\"Estimate_1\">Estimate 1</h4>\n\n<p>Finance is often taken to be the legal high earning career that\u2019s most harmful to society. The average Goldman Sachs employee earns around <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-16/at-goldman-the-average-pay-for-3-months-is-135-594\">$500,000 per year</a>. If someone joined Goldman and donated half of his earnings to Against Malaria Foundation, that would be about enough to save <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Costperlifesaved\">100 lives per year</a> (or more accurately, saving 4000 QALYs), plus likely have substantial positive <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">flow-through effects</a>. For Earning to Give at Goldman to be net harmful, the marginal employee would need to be causing the death of a hundred people each year. This would mean that Goldman Sachs employees are several orders of magnitude more deadly than American service people in Iraq.</p>\n\n<p>Goldman has <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-16/at-goldman-the-average-pay-for-3-months-is-135-594\">32,000 employees</a>. An upper bound for the harm caused by the marginal employee is thus the total harm caused divided by 32,000. For the harm to outweigh the good, Goldman would therefore have to be killing at least 3.2 million young people each year, or doing something else that is similarly harmful. That would mean that Goldman Sachs would need to be responsible for around 5% of all deaths in the world. Bear in mind that Goldman Sachs only makes up <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21563770\">22% of American investment banking</a>, and 3% of the American financial industry - if the rest of finance is similarly bad, then it would imply that finance is doing something as bad as causing <em>all</em> the deaths in the world.</p>\n\n<p>This is an upper bound, if we assume the Givewell estimate of cost per life saved won\u2019t go down, because (i) Goldman\u2019s activities will likely have some diminishing marginal returns (ii) there will be some level of replacement of Goldman employees. By (i), I mean that the 32,000th banker will have less impact than the rest of them. That\u2019s because the marginal bankers will have to take worse profit opportunities than the others, because the bankers will take the best opportunities first. If Goldman\u2019s harm is roughly proportional to its level of profit, then the marginal bankers will be much less harmful than the average banker. By (ii), I mean that if someone turns down a job at Goldman, Goldman <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/01/22/replaceability/\">will take some actions to compensate for that loss</a>, for instance they\u2019ll hire other people. This will probably result in a significant proportion of the harmful impact occurring anyway.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"Estimate_2\">Estimate 2</h4>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s consider the American financial industry in general. Upcoming Giving What We Can research estimates that it would take $200 billion a year to move everyone in the world above the $1.25 poverty line. That figure will only be $74 billion in 2030. The employees of the financial sector could do this if they transferred (e.g. via GiveDirectly) 30-75% of their salaries to those in extreme global poverty (depending on what date you want to achieve the goal by). In other words, if everyone in finance were Earning to Give, it would be possible to end extreme global poverty within the next twenty years. Harm would only dominate if the financial sector is doing something roughly as bad as single handedly causing all global poverty.</p>\n\n<p>For an individual doing Earning to Give at the margin, the situation is even better, and the levels of harm would have to be even worse to get outweighing. They\u2019ll be doing less harm due to replaceability, and can do more good since they can pick better donation opportunities than would be available if that huge amount of money were being spent on aid.</p>\n\n<p>I find it implausible that finance is causing this much harm. The most strident critics of finance claim that the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/08/bankster-fraud-is-not-a-victimless-crime-it-has-driven-100-million-into-poverty-killing-millions.html\">financial crisis will result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and around 100 million extra in poverty</a>. The crisis is often regarded as the most harmful effect of the financial industry in recent times. But we\u2019ve shown that if everyone in the financial sector were doing Earning to Give, it could save millions of lives and move <em>everyone</em>out of extreme poverty - far greater positive impact than the harm done by the crisis. And (i) it\u2019s difficult to claim that the people in the financial sector were wholly responsible for the crisis (ii) we\u2019ve totally ignored any of the positive effects of finance. <a href=\"http://infoproc.blogspot.co.uk/2009/07/against-finance.html\">This post</a> points out that the financial sector would only need to increase annual GDP growth by 0.1% in order to offset a financial crisis every twenty years that costs 15% of GDP.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"Doing_good_in_finance\">Doing good in finance</h2>\n<br>\n<p>It may even be that many people pursuing Earning to Give in unethical industries have a net positive impact in their work. That\u2019s because bringing more ethically motivated people into finance seems likely to make it more socially beneficial.</p>\n\n<p>All you need to do is to create less harm than your less ethically motivated replacement. For that, it just needs to be possible to turn down some opportunities to do harm. For instance, much of the harm caused by finance in the last crisis seems to have come from <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/janet-tavakoli/fraud-as-a-business-model_b_950806.html\">fraudulent</a> activities in packaging mortage debt. If you were working in this sector, but didn\u2019t engage in (as much) fraud you could have reduced how bad it was. Of course, there would have been pressures on you to earn more, which may have made it difficult to avoid and keep your job, but it seems unlikely there was <em>nothing</em> you could have done. Alternatively, there seem to be <a href=\"http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/CP%2B-%2BFinancial%2BInstability%2BFINISHED.pdf\">ways to reduce the harms of finance</a>. By advocating for these reforms from within, you might have some scope to improve finance from the inside.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"The_whistleblower_escape_hatch\">The whistleblower escape hatch</h3>\n<br>\n<p>If you find yourself involved in something that\u2019s really harmful, then there\u2019s always the option to quit, and perhaps even to do some good on the way by becoming a whistleblower.</p>\n\n<p>There have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_whistleblowers\">been many whistleblowers</a> who have played a vital role in uncovering massive scandals. A recent financial example is Sherron Watkins, who played a major role in bringing down Enron.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In August 2001, Sherron Watkins, then Enron\u2019s vice president for corporate development, sent an explosive, seven-page email to the energy company\u2019s CEO, Kenneth Lay. She detailed what she called an \u201d<a href=\"https://umdrive.memphis.edu/jturner1/www/ACCT7241/Articles/Sherron%20Watkins%20eMail%20to%20Enron%20Chairman%20Kenneth%20Lay.pdf\">elaborate accounting hoax</a>,\u201d which included inflating income and hiding epic losses. Although Lay claimed that he\u2019d launch an investigation, Watkins said that she was immediately punished; her computer\u2019s hard drive was confiscated and her desk relocated to the nether regions of Enron. <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/enron-files-for-bankruptcy\">Four months later</a>, Enron could no longer sustain the fraud, and it filed for bankruptcy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(quoting from <a href=\"http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2013/06/12/famous-whistle-blowers-snowden/#!slide=5954390\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p>With whistleblowing, the more severe the harm being done in the industry, the more impact you have! Whistleblowers are rare and often have an outsized impact.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"Other_objections\">Other objections</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"It_s_all_signalling\">It\u2019s all signalling</h3>\n<br>\n<p>An alternative source of harm from doing Earning to Give is signalling your support for a harmful or suboptimal system. This could have an effect on the actions of others, which leads to negative effects, in particular, it makes it harder to fundamentally change the system.</p>\n\n<p>I think this effect is likely to be very small in most cases. First, I doubt many people will be strongly influenced if someone they know enters finance or law. It\u2019s a widely accepted path that lots of people already take, and they generally take it in order to get the large salary rather than because they were influenced by their friends.</p>\n\n<p>Second, it seems possible to mitigate the negative signalling (if you think this is an issue) by telling people \u201cI don\u2019t support the system, but I think that engaging with the system is currently the best way for me to make the world better.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Third, doing Earning to Give has positive signalling effects too. In particular, you\u2019re promoting the ideas of (i) spending lots of your income to good causes rather than spending on it luxury goods and (ii) effective giving. These signals seem much stronger than the negative ones. We\u2019ve seen concrete examples of one person\u2019s donations leading to others.</p>\n\n<p>I expand on these effects more from section 5.3. of <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/1807196/Which_Ethical_Careers_Make_a_Difference_The_Replaceability_Issue_in_the_Ethics_of_Career_Choice\">this document</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Collective_action\">Collective action</h3>\n<br>\n<p>A related worry is that considering Earning to Give might lead to a failure of collective action, in which lots of people end up propagating a system that is sub-optimal when a much better option was on the table. We address this objection <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/61-collective-action-working-in-unethical-industries-part-2\">here</a>. The quick answer is that only happens if effective altruists coordinate badly. As effective altruists become more numerous, it\u2019s seem far more likely that coordination will be good enough that they\u2019ll be able to solve these big problems, rather than get stuck in a situation where all the investment banks are filled with people doing Earning to Give but the system is unchanged.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"Could_you_do_more_good_elsewhere_\">Could you do more good elsewhere?</h3>\n<br>\n<p>An objection to Earning to Give that seems much more plausible is that taking a high earning job in order to donate more involves giving up an even better opportunity to do good. It\u2019s implausible that the harm done within high earning jobs is greater than the good done by effective donations, but it might be <em>even better</em> to work in a more socially beneficial job but donate less. For this to be true, the extra good you do in socially beneficial jobs (compared to non-beneficial high earning jobs) would have to be significantly larger than the good done by the extra donations you could make.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019re highly uncertain about for which jobs this is the case. In the past, we have advised effective altruists with a particularly strong comparative advantage for earning money to go into Earning to Give, while we\u2019ve advised others to go into jobs that directly do good in <a href=\"/causes\">effective cause</a> areas.</p>\n\n<p>There may be other situations when it is better not to do Earning to Give. For instance, if you think boosting economic productivity is highly important, then it might be a mistake to swap entrepreneurship or engineering (which presumably increase society\u2019s wealth significantly) for finance or law (which presumably don\u2019t help nearly as much) in order to earn slightly more. We\u2019re planning to write more about this soon.</p>\n\n<p>All told, the question of who can make the most difference through Earning to Give seems very unsettled. See this post for some of the <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/191-why-earning-to-give-is-often-not-the-best-option\">arguments against pursuing Earning to Give</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Thank you to Carl Shulman for providing comments on a draft and several of the examples.</em></p></div></div>"},

For instance <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/100-let-s-stop-building-schools\">building schools</a>, <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Funding-the-Right-Program\">funding expensive AIDS treatment</a>, and <a href=\"http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/i-am-anti-awareness-and-you-should-be-too/\">raising awareness</a> about <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/10/pink-politics.html\">breast cancer</a> and <a href=\"http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2009/10/17/does-stopping-prejudice-spread-prejudice/\">low status</a>.</p><p>For many other endeavors, it is possible to tell a story under which they are massively important, and hard to conclusively show that we don\u2019t live in that story. Yet it is also hard to make a very strong case that they are better than a huge number of other activities. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.chinadialogue.net/\">changing policy discourse in China</a>, <a href=\"http://www.coolearth.org/\">averting rainforest deforestation</a> or <a href=\"http://openborders.info/\">pushing for US immigration reform</a>.</p><p>There are also (at least in theory) endeavors that can be reasonably expected to be much better than anything else available. Given current disagreement over what fits in this category, it seems to either be empty at the moment, or highly dependent on values.</p><p>An important question for those interested in <a title=\"Effective giving\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_giving\">effective altruism</a> is whether most of the gains from effectiveness are to come from people who support the obviously ineffective endeavors moving to plausibly effective ones, or from people who support the plausibly effective endeavors moving to the very probably effective ones.</p><p>One reason this matters is that the first jump requires hardly any new research about actual endeavors, while the second seems to require a lot of it. Another is that the first plan involves engaging quite a different demographic to the second, and probably in a different way. Finally, the second plan requires intellectual standards that can actually filter out the plausible endeavors from the very good ones. Such standards seem hard to develop and maintain. Upholding norms that filter terrible interventions from plausible ones is plenty of work, and probably easier.</p><p>My own intuition has been that most of the value will come from the second possibility. However I suspect others have the opposite feeling, or at least aim to exploit the first possibility more at the moment. What do you think? Is the distinction even just?</p><p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2013/10/22/which-stage-of-effectiveness/\">Meteuphoric</a></em></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "12th Aug 2013", "title": "Update on the establishment of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Study of Existential Risk", "author": "Sean_OHeigeartaigh2", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Cambridge\u2019s high-profile launch of the <a href=\"http://cser.org/\">Centre for Study of Existential Risk</a> last November received considerable interest from the section of the altruist community interested in safeguarding the future, and a number of people have been enquiring as to what\u2018s happened since. This post is meant to give a little explanation and update of what\u2019s been going on.</p><p>Motivated by a common concern over human activity-related risks to humanity, Lord Martin Rees, Professor Huw Price, and Jaan Tallinn founded the Centre for Study of Existential Risk last year. However, this announcement was made before the establishment of a physical research centre or securement of long-term funding. The last 9 months have been focused on turning an important idea into a reality.</p><p>Following the announcement in November, Professor Price contacted us at the Future of Humanity Institute regarding the possibility of collaboration on joint academic funding opportunities; the aim being both to raise the funds for CSER\u2019s research programmes and to support joint work by the FHI and CSER\u2019s researchers on anthropogenic existential risk. We submitted our first grant application in January to the European Research council \u2013 an ambitious project to create \u201cA New Science of Existential Risk\u201d that, if successful, would provide enough funding for CSER\u2019s first research programme - a sizeable programme that will run for five years. We\u2019ve been successful in the first and second rounds, and we will hear a final round decision at the end of the year. It was also an opportunity for us to get some additional leading academics onto the project \u2013 Sir Partha Dasgupta, Professor of Economics at Cambridge and an expert in social choice theory, sustainability and intergenerational ethics, is a co-PI (along with Huw Price, Martin Rees and Nick Bostrom). In addition, a number of prominent academics concerned about technology-related risk \u2013 including Stephen Hawking, David Spiegelhalter, George Church and David Chalmers \u2013 have joined our advisory board.</p><p>The FHI regards establishment of CSER as of the highest priority for a number of reasons including:\n</p><ol>\n\t<li>The value of the research the Centre will engage in</li>\n\t<li>The reputational boost to the field of Existential Risk gained by the establishment of high-profile research centre in Cambridge.</li>\n\t<li>The impact on policy and public perception that academic heavy-hitters like Rees and Price can have</li>\n</ol>\nTherefore we\u2019ve been working with CSER behind the scenes over the last 9 months. Progress has been a little slow until now \u2013 Huw, Martin and Jaan are fully committed to this project, but due to their other responsibilities aren\u2019t in a position to work full-time on it yet.<p></p><p>However, we\u2019re now in a position to make CSER\u2019s establishment official. Cambridge\u2019s new Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH) will host CSER and provide logistical support. I\u2019ll be acting manager of CSER\u2019s activities over the coming 6-12 months, under the guidance of Huw, Martin and Jaan. A generous seed funding donation from Jaan Tallinn is funding CSER\u2019s establishment and these activities \u2013 which will include a lecture series, workshops, public outreach, and staff time on grant-writing and fundraising. It\u2019ll also provide a buyout of a fraction of my time from FHI (providing funds for us to hire part-time staff to offload some of the FHI workload and help with some of the CSER work).</p><p>At the moment and over the next couple of months we\u2019re going to be focused on identifying and working on additional academic funding opportunities for additional programmes, as well as chasing some promising leads in industry, private and philanthropic funding. I\u2019ll also be aiming to keep CSER\u2019s public profile active. There will be newsletters every three months (sign up <a href=\"http://cser.org/contact.html\">here</a>), the website\u2019s going to be fleshed out to contain more detail about our planned research and existing literature, and we\u2019ll be arranging regular high-quality media engagement. While we\u2019re unlikely to have time to answer every general query that comes in (though we\u2019ll try whenever possible: email: admin@cser.org), we\u2019ll aim to keep the existential risk community informed through the newsletters and posts such as these.</p><p>We\u2019ve been lucky to get a lot of support from the academic and existential risk community for the CSER centre. In addition to CRASSH, Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Science and Policy will provide support in making policy-relevant links, and may co-host and co-publicise events. We\u2019ve also received some very valuable advice and support from members of the effective altruism community.</p><p>From where I\u2019m sitting, CSER\u2019s successful launch is looking very promising. The timeline on our research programmes, however, is still a little more uncertain. If we\u2019re successful with Europe, we can expect to be hiring a full research team next spring. If not, it may take a little longer, but we\u2019re exploring a number of different opportunities in parallel and are feeling confident. The support of the existential risk community continues to be invaluable.</p></div></div>"},

It\u2019s main thesis is that by being a \u2018giver\u2019 in relationships \u2014 by helping other people as much as possible, without any expectation of your favours being returned in the near future \u2014 you end up being much more successful, in a wide variety of settings, in the long run. It\u2019s interesting, well written, and informative. I\u2019d recommend it.</p><p>It got me thinking about helping each other in the EA community. Grant is suggesting that we underestimate the value of helping others as a way of benefitting ourselves in the long run. If that\u2019s true, then within the effective altruism community we probably radically underestimate the value of helping other EAs to be more successful.</p><p>The norms we are used to, and have internalised, govern situations where, in general (but by no means always), everyone is looking to benefit themselves. So you help other people in order that you can benefit yourself, and we should have expected the norms that we\u2019ve internalised (like \u2018tit for tat\u2019) to be good norms for governing that sort of interaction. However, if you and I share the same values, the social situation is very different: if I help you achieve your aims, then that\u2019s a success, in terms of achieving my aims too. Titting constitutes winning in and of itself \u2014 there\u2019s no need for a tat in reward. For this reason, we should expect very different norms than we are used to be optimal: giving and helping others will be a good thing to do much more often than it would be if we were all self-interested.</p><p>I\u2019ll end with an exhortation. One of the incredible strengths of the EA community is that we all share values and share the same end-goals. This gives us a remarkable potential for much more in-depth cooperation than is normal in businesses or other settings where people are out for themselves. So next time you talk to another effective altruist, ask them how you can help them achieve their aims. It can be a great way of achieving what you value.</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "30th May 2013", "title": "Could you live on the international poverty line?", "author": "RyanCarey", "num_comments": "1 comment", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>I\u2019ve heard that to live in poverty, you have to make impossible decisions. For example, will you feed your son, allow him to starve so that your daughter can attend school, or take your mother to the doctor at the expense of both? The International poverty line should help us to relate to this kind of challenge. However, US$1.25 seems like an impossibly small amount of money to live on. So what can you truly buy on the international poverty line, and how is this line determined?\n</p><h2 id=\"The_international_poverty_line_is_determined_by_the_World_Bank__and_is_Purchasing_Power_Parity__PPP__adjusted\">The international poverty line is determined by the World Bank, and is Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjusted</h2>\nIn 80% of cases, the World Bank calculates a local poverty line using the <i>cost of basic needs</i> method (1). That is, they find the price of a food bundle containing the daily energy requirement and add basic non-food expenses like access to shelter and fresh drinking water. In India, where one third of the world\u2019s poor live (2), this gives a poverty line of 18 Rupees (3).<p></p><p>18 Rupees are only worth 41 cents. However, as you will know if you are a traveller, this amount of money will buy more groceries in India than back home. This is why the Bank performs a PPP adjustment. Across a wide range of goods, they compare the prices of identical items in each country, in this case the US and India. Since these items cost three times as much in the US, the international poverty line is scaled up from 41c to $1.25. The groceries that you can buy for $1.25 have same value as 18 rupees of Indian groceries. So this low figure of US$1.25 is not just a trick of different purchasing powers.\n</p><h2 id=\"Living_on__1_25_in_the_US_would_be_hard\">Living on $1.25 in the US would be hard</h2>\n$1.25 of US groceries will have <i>the same value</i> as 18 rupees of Indian groceries. However, they still may not contain enough energy. To illustrate this principle, suppose you bring $1.25 to the cheapest supermarket you can find. Even there, the rice on offer is <i>valuable</i> for its fibre content. The beans are <i>valuable </i>because they are organic. These inflate the cost of the groceries, but they don\u2019t help you. Your $1.25 of groceries \u2013 luxurious though they may be \u2013 may not meet your daily energy requirements.<p></p><p>There is no straightforward way for the World Bank to correct for the variation between these economies. The PPPs compare items from the entire cross-section of each nation\u2019s spending; they do not focus on the purchasing of the poorest individuals. A measure based on the consumption of the poor, called a <i>Poverty Purchasing Power Parity</i>, is very useful for comparing developing nations. However, it cannot be reliably extended to the US because no one there is poor on the global scale. \u201cThere are n<i>o poverty line weights for the United States because no one lives at that level\u201d</i> (4)<i>, </i>say World Bank authors Deaton and Dupriez<i>. </i>To improve on the $1.25 figure, and truly understand poverty in terms of our own currency, we would need to start over with the cost of our basic needs.</p><p>On average, food expenses make up 56% of the international poverty line (5). \u00a0Will this hold true for those living in the US? Well, we know from <i>Live Below the Line</i> that $1.50 of food is barely enough to survive. This could easily blow our budget. Fortunately, as Will McAskill points out, there is a robust, though unfashionable alternative (6). If we gather food discarded by retailers, a practice known as dumpster-diving, we will reduce our food expenditure to practically zero. So the availability of discarded food will redeem our rich society for its absence of cheap food!</p><p>Obtaining shelter is at least equally difficult. It will be tempting to become homeless and live under the side of a building or landscaping (7), or to become a squatter. Private homeless shelters may aid us. It may be optimal to live in a van, although if this costs two thousand dollars (8), we will have spent five years\u2019 money at once. Maybe we could live in old cars, or share one. Maybe we ought to resell it in order to make some of our money back. Fortunately, some education and healthcare are available for free.</p><p>Living on $1.25 per day in the US may be feasible. However, as no one lives so cheaply in the US (9), it is unclear whether this is easier or harder than living on the poverty line overseas.\n</p><h2 id=\"The_relative_poverty_line_is_not_a_better_estimate\">The relative poverty line is not a better estimate</h2>\nRelative poverty is measured by taking the average or median income in a society and then halving it, or by asking people \u201cHow much they would need to get by\u201d. The argument for relieving relative poverty is that relative deprivation matters to a person\u2019s welfare. However, though relative poverty is harmful, it is the kind of harm that is likely require larger amounts of resources to relieve. If I was asked the amount required to get by before I researched the issue myself, I would not be able to imagine how resourceful one can be if absolutely required. This will be a systematic flaw of polling people regarding poverty.<p></p><p>Consider that on a relative view, if your Body Mass Index (BMI) is less than your country\u2019s average, then you are <i>relatively malnourished.</i> If you buy cheaper clothes than others in your society, you are <i>relatively naked</i>. These measurements regard infer that you are poor when actually your society spends extravagantly and vainly. Here is the hard line: the American absolute poverty line is simply the international absolute poverty line, US$1.25. Although this picture is imperfect, it comes far closer to the truth than just substituting half a nation\u2019s median income.\n</p><h2 id=\"And_what_do_groceries_cost_in_Bangalore_\">And what do groceries cost in Bangalore?</h2>\nAdjusting for inflation in India since the 2005 ICP, the old figure of 18 rupees can be adjusted up to 36 rupees (10). I have gathered some prices from an online shopping service based on Bangalore, to suggest what you can and can\u2019t afford on this budget (click to open):\n<div><p></p><p><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/j4zyAeh.png\"><img alt=\"In order to register and view the prices at this website, ecityindia.com, you need only provide a valid postcode in Bangalore\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/j4zyAeh.png\"></a><br>Online shops target richer than average Indian consumers, and there are likely to be better deals elsewhere. On the other hand, remember to save some of your 36 rupees for expenses other than groceries!\n</p><h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\nSo $1.25 per day of your funds may not be enough to live in America. However, 41 cents is enough to live elsewhere. Now might be a good time to reevaluate your sense of privilege!<p></p><p>At little cost, you can help others a lot.

I tend to spread donations out throughout the year, so I don't feel a particular rush in December. But, since the end of the tax year is a lot of people's giving season, I want to share my thoughts.</p><p>My previous favorite, the Against Malaria Foundation, is <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/26/change-in-against-malaria-foundation-recommendation-status-room-for-more-funding-related/\">not looking so good</a> lately due to problems distributing their mosquito nets. I'm not super concerned about this \u2013 I think it's likely that they'll get their act together in the next six months or so and resume distributing nets. But I don't plan to donate to them until that happens. (This is the kind of thing I'm really glad GiveWell is here to tell me about \u2013 as a donor, I would never have picked up on the problem.)</p><p>My parents usually make a donation as a Christmas present to me, and they asked where they should make it. \u00a0I asked them to give to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly\">Give Directly</a>. \u00a0I think the just-give-cash method makes a lot of sense, given the evidence that recipients choose quite well what they need, and I hope this idea will catch on. \u00a0The organization itself seems quite transparent and sensibly run. \u00a0I also found it encouraging that so many GiveWell staff are making <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/12/staff-members-personal-donations/\">their personal donations</a> there.</p><p>I can see advantages to donating later, especially given the fact that the Against Malaria Foundation (which looked like the strongest contender for a good while) may catch up again soon. \u00a0So I'll probably hold most of my donations for about six months and see how things look then.</p><p>If I were holding off longer, like years, I would probably put my donations in a donor-advised fund like <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/about/donate/donor-advised-fund\">GiveWell's</a> or\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-10-29/the-giving-what-we-can-trust\">Giving What We Can's</a>.</p><p>I also plan to donate some to organizations like GiveWell, Giving What We Can, or 80,000 Hours (I haven't decided on the breakdown yet). \u00a0I think this is an important time both for exposing more people to the idea of effective altruism and for developing better knowledge about where to give. \u00a0I need to look more specifically into what those organizations would do with more funding.</p><p>Lastly, I'll make some feel-good donations to causes that aren't the most effective (a fundraiser for a friend's business, my Quaker meeting, etc.) These donations come out of my personal spending budget, not my charity budget.</p><p>One obvious question is: why divide up money rather than giving all to one place? Giving What We Can makes some good points in their <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-11-20/should-you-only-donate-to-one-charity\">recent post</a> about why to donate all to one charity. \u00a0But I'm also persuaded that we should act how we want other people to act, and I wouldn't want the whole effective altruist community to donate to only one place. \u00a0So I'm okay with dividing things up a bit.</p><p><em>Cross-posted from <a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/\">Giving Gladly</a></em></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "10th Dec 2013", "title": "What's the best domestic charity?", "author": "William_MacAskill", "num_comments": "11 comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Here's a very tentative thought: A lot of people respond to effective altruism by saying that they want to give to charities that work on their home country. Insofar as effective altruists (typically, roughly speaking) care about everyone equally, they obviously care about the welfare of Americans (Brits, Australians, Canadians, etc). It's just that, because of diminishing returns, the best opportunities for helping people are very likely to be abroad. However, it wouldn't be <em>that</em> surprising to me if there were very good giving opportunities domestically. \u00a0All it would take is for some very cheap but very effective activity to have been relatively overlooked in the domestic charity sector, or for some domestic charitable activity to have high positive externalities or large positive flow-on effects.</p><p>So it's at least somewhat plausible to me that the best response to \"charity begins at home\" is \"ok, if that's what you value you should give to [insert good domestic charity].\" That response would:\n</p><ol>\n\t<li>Show people that we're supportive of all attempts to do good, even if there are value-disagreements (a lot of recent criticism comes down to \"how dare you be so moralistic and condemn such-and-such cause as unworthy\" which isn't what we're trying to say at all).</li>\n\t<li>Make for an easier entry into a conversation about values, and to then discuss why people choose to support domestic charities over international ones. It would show we're on the same side - maximising impact - and are just differing in our implementation of that general maxim. (Obviously, many people might just be trying to come up with excuses for not giving effectively in general. But then giving domestic recommendations would test whether that's the case or not.)</li>\n\t<li>Potentially get a much wider demographic of people interested in effective altruism.</li>\n\t<li>Potentially - if we actually can find great domestic charities (including, perhaps, ones with positive international externalities) - move poorly spent charitable giving to more effective causes.</li>\n</ol>\nI know that GiveWell used to recommend domestic charities, and I disagreed with them then for doing so. I would still disagree with them if they were to recommend Nurse-Family Partnership or KIPP Houston, as I doubt that these have the requisite level of good done per dollar to be worth promoting.<p></p><p>But others might do better. [Edit: After comments suggesting that these 'illustrations' are low-quality enough to be actively misleading, I take back the following]. <del>Off the top of my head, these might be contenders:</del>\n</p><ul>\n\t<li><del>Promoting mindfulness meditation. Reason: Depression is set to soon become the largest contributor to the global burden of disease. Mindfulness meditation seems to have a good evidence base behind it, for reducing rates of depression, anxiety and general stress. It consists mainly of breathing exercises, and could be taught through mass media, which could give it a very low cost per person treated. As well as the benefits to the people treated, it could have significant positive flow-on effects: (i) <a href=\"http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/does_mindfulness_make_you_compassionate\">it has been suggested</a> that mindfulness meditation boosts leads to increased levels <a href=\"http://compassion.stanford.edu/programs/researchProjects.html\">of</a> <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12671-012-0115-4\">altruism</a>; [NB: I haven't vetted these claims at all] (ii) it would increase productivity of those in the US, and general economic growth is good, including for poorer countries through the increased value of trade; (iii) if successful it could be rolled out to developing countries as well.</del></li>\n\t<li><del>Paying to support the better political party, such as through Get Out the Vote. (See Carl Shulman's excellent post about this <a title=\"Politics as Charity\" href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/2qq/politics_as_charity/\">here</a>.) If the party with better domestic policies also has better international policies, then this would have significant benefits for the developing world.</del></li>\n</ul>\nThese aren't meant to be actual suggestions, just illustrations of how this could work. I'm interested to know if others have more ideas.<p></p></div></div>"},

Top undergraduates who want to \u201cmake a difference\u201d are encouraged to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/education/23careers.html?_r=0\">forgo</a> the <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/wall-streets-latest-recruiting-crisis-on-campuses/\">allure</a> of Wall Street and work in the charity sector. And many people in finance have a mid-career <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-03/chelsea-clinton-exited-wall-street-to-seek-career-with-meaning\">ethical crisis</a> and switch to something <a href=\"http://mathbabe.org/2012/09/30/telling-people-to-leave-finance/\">fulfilling</a>.</p>\n<p>The intentions may be good, but is it really the best way to make a difference? I used to think so, but while researching ethical career choice, I concluded that it\u2019s in fact better to earn a lot of money and donate a good chunk of it to the most cost-effective charities\u2014a path that I call \u201c<a href=\"http://80000hours.org/earning-to-give\">earning to give</a>.\u201d Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and the others who have taken the 50% <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/12/19/cost-effectiveness-of-nets-vs-deworming-vs-cash-transfers/\">Giving Pledge</a> are the best-known examples. But you don\u2019t have to be a billionaire. By making as much money as we can and donating to the best causes, we can each save hundreds of lives.</p>\n<p>There are three considerations behind this. First is the <a href=\"http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm\">discrepancy in earnings</a> between the different career paths. Annual salaries in banking or investment start at $80,000 and grow to over $500,000 if you do well. A lifetime salary of over $10 million is typical. Careers in nonprofits start at about $40,000, and don\u2019t typically exceed $100,000, even for executive directors. Over a lifetime, a typical salary is only about $2.5 million. By entering finance and donating 50% of your lifetime earnings, you could pay for two nonprofit workers in your place\u2014while still living on double what you would have if you\u2019d chosen that route.</p>\n<p>The second consideration is that \u201cmaking a difference\u201d requires <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/18-just-what-is-making-a-difference-counterfactuals-and-career-choice\">doing something that wouldn\u2019t have happened</a> anyway. Suppose you come across a woman who\u2019s had a heart attack. Luckily, someone trained in CPR is keeping her alive until the ambulance arrives. But you also know CPR. Should you push this other person\u00a0out of the way and take over? The answer is obviously \u201cno.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t be a hero; you wouldn\u2019t have made a difference.</p>\n<p>So it goes in the charity sector. The competition for not-for-profit jobs is fierce, and if someone else takes the job instead of you, he or she likely won\u2019t be much worse at it than you would have been. So the difference you make by taking the job is only the difference between the good you would do, and the good that the other person would have done.</p>\n<p>The competition for finance jobs is even more fierce than for nonprofits, but if someone else gets the finance job instead of you, he or she would not likely donate as much to charity. The average donation from an American household is <a href=\"http://philanthropy.com/article/Interactive-How-America-Gives/133709/\">less than 5% of income</a>\u2014a proportion that decreases the richer the household. So if you are determined to give a large share of your earnings to charity, the difference you make by taking that job is much greater.</p>\n<p>The third and most important consideration is that charities vary tremendously in the amount of good they do with <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/our-research/the-moral-imperative-towards-cost-effectiveness\">the money they receive</a>. For example, it <a href=\"http://www.guidedogsofamerica.org/1/mission/#cost\">costs about $40,000</a> to train and provide a guide dog for one person, but it costs less than $25 to cure one person of <a href=\"http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09286580590932761%E2%80%B3\">sight-destroying trachoma</a>. For the cost of improving the life of one person with blindness, you can cure 1,000 people of it.</p>\n<p>This matters because if you decide to work in the charity sector, you\u2019re rather limited. You can only change jobs so many times, and it\u2019s unlikely that you can work for only the very best charities. In contrast, if you earn to give, you can donate anywhere, preferably to the most cost-effective charities, and change your donations as often as you like.</p>\n<p>Not many people consider \u201cearning to give\u201d as a career path. But it\u2019s proving popular. A good number of students that I\u2019ve presented this idea to have pursued it. One student, convinced by these arguments, now works at Jane Street, the trading firm, giving 50% of his income, and thus can already pay the wages of several people for the not-for-profit work he could have been doing.</p>\n<p>In general, the charitable sector is people-rich but money-poor. Adding another person to the labor pool just isn\u2019t as valuable as providing more money so that more workers can be hired. You might feel less directly involved because you haven\u2019t dedicated every hour of your day to charity, but you\u2019ll have made a much bigger difference.</p>\n<p>Part of\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/\">Introduction to Effective Altruism</a></p>\n<p>Previous:\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/73/givewells_top_charities_for_giving_season_2013/\">GiveWell's Top Charities for Giving Season 2013</a>\u00a0\u2022 Next:\u00a0<a href=\"/ea/74/high_impact_science/\">High Impact Science</a></p></div></div>"},

I donated to AMF, SCI, Deworm the World, Project Healthy Children, and the Copenhagen Consensus Center because I want to demonstrate my support for extremely cost-effective first-order charities. But I think that the highest-expected-value donation opportunities are to 'meta' organisations. I think that the Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA), Centre for the Study of Existential Risks (CSER), and setting up an Effective Altruism Fund are the three big contenders for best expected bang per buck. Even after trying to correct for obvious personal bias, I think that CEA wins out for my comparatively small donation; if I had info that the relevant position at CSER wouldn't be funded anyway, and if I had more to give (e.g. ~$70k) then I think that CSER would be better.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"0__Introduction\">0. Introduction</h3><p></p><p>I divided my donations into two classes.</p><p>First, because my donations partly represent the Centre for Effective Altruism as a whole, I use about half of my donations as a way of demonstrating my support for highly cost-effective organisations that lie outside the core effective altruism community. This year I donated to AMF, SCI, Deworm the World, Project Healthy Children, and the Copenhagen Consensus Center. (Because these have the purpose of showing my support, the <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-11-20/should-you-only-donate-to-one-charity\">usual arguments</a> in favour of giving to just one charity don\u2019t apply). These were all recommended by GWWC except the Copenhagen Consensus Center \u2013 I chose to donate to them because I think that promoting global prioritisation is one of the most important activities to be doing, and, though harder to be sure about, their influence is potentially measured in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. (My main worry with them is that Lomborg\u2019s (inaccurate) reputation as a climate skeptic might taint the idea of global prioritisation.) I didn\u2019t donate to GiveDirectly because I don\u2019t find GiveWell\u2019s arguments for their \u2018upside\u2019 potential to be compelling as a reason to donate on the margin. (Some discussion <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2012-11-30/givewell%E2%80%99s-recommendation-of-givedirectly\">here</a>, though this post is now a year old).</p><p>The second half of my donations I used in whatever way I believe will maximise expected impact, given my particular values and knowledge. I think there are three main contenders.\n</p><h3 id=\"1__Donating_unrestricted_to_the_Centre_for_Effective_Altruism\">1. Donating unrestricted to the Centre for Effective Altruism</h3>\nI think that building the effective altruism movement is in general the highest-value near term activity, for two reasons:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Leverage. $1 donated to movement-building generates significantly more than $1\u2019s worth of money and time for the highest-value causes. My view is that this rate of return is far beyond what one could get through financial investment. I\u2019ve written about this before <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/fej/giving_what_we_can_80000_hours_and_metacharity/\">here</a>.</li>\n\t<li>Keeping options open. Effective altruists\u2019 donations and use of time are sensitive to the best evidence. I expect our evidence about the best uses of time and money to get much better over the next few years.\u00a0 This would motivate saving and giving later \u00a0(see <a href=\"/ea/4e/giving_now_vs_later_a_summary/\">here</a> for more arguments on either side) \u2013 but donating to movement-building is a way of doing that, except with a higher rate of return.</li>\n</ol>\nThe best precise donation opportunity in this area, in my view, is to CEA, unrestricted such that it can be spent on projects other than Giving What We Can and 80,000 Hours. There are a number of new projects that are plausibly even higher-impact, on the margin, than GWWC/80k, but which don\u2019t have a track record, and so are comparatively difficult to fundraise for. For example, we\u2019ve recently been involved in a number of meetings with people in the UK government, and we wish to develop ideas from CEA and FHI into policy-relevant documents. We are hiring an Oxford academic to help with this (among other things).<p></p><p>CEA unrestricted is where I ultimately chose to give. There is obviously a great risk of bias: it seems to me to be an awful coincidence if I think that the organisation I cofounded is the most cost-effective use of money on the margin. But, even after trying to correct for these biases, CEA remained my top choice. (A partial response to the \u2018coincidence\u2019 worry is that a <i>very</i> small number of organisations have ever been started with the aim of maximising the good they do, where the founders\u2019 view of \u2018maximising the good\u2019 is the same as or similar to mine (i.e. understood in effective altruist terms).)\n</p><h3 id=\"2__Donating_to_the_Centre_for_the_Study_of_Existential_Risks\">2. Donating to the Centre for the Study of Existential Risks</h3>\nFrom what I know, this seems like an opportunity for great leverage. Marginal donations will be used to fund program management and grantwriting, which would turn ~$70k into a significant chance of ~$1-$10mn, and launch what I think might become one of the most important research institutions in the world. They have high profile people on the board, Cambridge affiliation, and an already written previous grant proposal that very narrowly missed out on being successful (for ~$10mn). It seems to me that they just need a bit of start-up money in order to hire someone to apply for major grants.<p></p><p>I\u2019ve only been thinking of them as a donation opportunity recently, and would need to know more about CSER\u2019s funding situation before being confident in the above views. For example, if Jaan Tallinn is already paying for a program manager or grant writer, then this leverage opportunity might already have been taken. This expenditure is also pretty lumpy, and I don't expect them to get all their donations from small individual donations, so it seems to me that donating 1/50th of the cost of a program manager isn't as good as 1/50th of the value of a program manager. For those with a larger amount to give, the situation is different.\n</p><h3 id=\"3__Setting_up_an_Effective_Altruism_Fund\">3. Setting up an Effective Altruism Fund</h3>\nThe idea behind this is that it\u2019s meant to be strictly better than saving and donating later. The idea is that people who are saving in order to donate later tell some central body \u2013 the EA fund \u2013 how much they\u2019re saving. The EA fund can then advertise the fact that it has some significant amount of money that\u2019s waiting for a high-impact enough opportunity. This could have the following benefits:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Incentivises new effective altruism start-ups, which could get seed funding from it (e.g. Effective Fundraising needed just a few thousand dollars \u2013 a use of money that I think was clearly worth it).</li>\n\t<li>Can be used as loans e.g. for people who want to pursue earning to give but need to retrain.</li>\n\t<li>Can be used as \u2018emergency reserves\u2019 for several organisations. (Insofar as risks of running out of funding should be only partially correlated between different EA organisations, it makes sense for there to be a shared pool of funding, rather than each organisation having their own reserves.\u00a0 This means you need a lower total amount of reserves than if every organisation had their own).</li>\n\t<li>Can be used as insurance for individuals. Insofar as individuals will be more risk-averse with respect to money when thinking about their own self-interest than when thinking altruistically, we should expect people to be biased in the direction of playing it safe in their career choices. This could be a way of encouraging people to take more risks \u2013 by giving them a safety net if things turn out badly.\u00a0 \u00a0(Note: though this makes sense in theory, I haven\u2019t seen examples of it in practice, perhaps because there are few paths that result in total failure if they don\u2019t work out. It might apply for someone, for example, thinking about entrepreneurship versus consultancy and worried by the failure rate of new start-ups.)</li>\n</ol>\nMy view is that this is better than saving and donating later (if you have donations greater than, say, $20,000). But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as good, right now, as CEA or CSER donations.<p></p><p>GiveWell would have been on the above list of contenders if their funding needs were greater. I think they\u2019re right to want to diversify their funding. But being the very best place to donate is a high bar, and donating to extend GW\u2019s reserves, when they already have GoodVentures as a fall-back, seems unlikely to me to be the best use of funds. Since their first blog post asking for donations, they\u2019ve already raised $250,000; I expect them to soon raise enough to cover next year\u2019s expenses. (Or to figure out a way of being funded by GoodVentures <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/20/update-on-givewells-funding-needs/comment-page-1/#comment-818580\">without the problems</a>). As a comparison: whereas GiveWell is looking to raise enough reserves to cover 24 months (in line with their excess assets policy; this includes future pledged donations), because of rapid growth 80,000 Hours and Giving What We Can have recently been operating on only a few months of reserves.</p></div></div>"},

Let me explain.</p><p>If someone complains that <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/what-earning-give-0\">earning to give</a> is \u2018double counting\u2019, because it means that both the person earning to give and the charity worker get \u2018credit\u2019 for saving lives, then I understand the objection, recognise the mistake, and can refer the objector to <a href=\"http://www.stafforini.com/txt/Parfit%20-%20Five%20mistakes%20in%20moral%20mathematics.pdf\">Five Mistakes in Moral Mathematics</a> in Derek Parfit\u2019s <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasons_and_Persons\">Reasons and Persons</a></em>.</p><p>But if someone complains that earning to give is wrong because it is supporting an unjust system, or because the very idea of trying to work out how much good you can do is mistaken, then I feel much less confident that I\u2019ve accurately diagnosed their objection. I try to parse it into terms that I can understand and sympathise with, for example: \u201cAre you saying that there\u2019s a moral prohibition against being complicit in injustice, which can\u2019t be violated even in pursuit of a greater good?\u201d or \u201cAre you saying that weighing expected costs and expected benefits is just so difficult that we\u2019re almost certain to be misled by doing so, and it\u2019s better to go with gut intuitive judgments?\u201d</p><p>But, with my self-skeptical hat on, I get an uneasy sense that none of my translations are quite right - especially when they don\u2019t convince the other person.</p><p>So far, there hasn\u2019t been much in-depth discussion of effective altruism from people who have these sorts of objections, and I think a decent proportion of my worry could be resolved if I did have more discussion from such people. So if any reader has a friend or colleague who understands effective altruism well, is well-informed about the relevant issues, but thinks that the whole idea is badly mistaken, I\u2019d welcome them to write a post or series on this blog explaining why. (I\u2019d welcome the same for people who majorly disagree with not just the specifics but the very project or spirit of Bayesian epistemology).</p></div></div>"},

What\u2019s more, there\u2019s surprisingly little debate about how to answer it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m excited to see effective altruism gaining traction. I hope this movement generates more debate, in particular about philanthropy and how to do the most good through giving.</p><p>Many people I\u2019ve encountered in the philanthropic sector seem to believe this question is impossible to answer or the wrong question to be asking. They argue there\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d answer to the question of where to give and advise us to follow our passions when deciding which charitable causes to pursue.</p><p>I agree that there\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d answer. There are no sure bets in philanthropy \u2014 every grant involves risk, even to organizations with well-studied programs and strong track records \u2014 and we\u2019re always working with incomplete information. But if our goal is to help other people as much as we can, I believe there are better and worse answers to the question of where to give. Importantly, I also believe it\u2019s possible to learn and arrive at better and better answers over time. That\u2019s what makes my job exciting, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/excited-altruism\">passionate</a> about the question of how to do the most good with our giving.</p><p>To me, effective altruism is not about having the right answers. It\u2019s about a commitment to continuous learning, questioning my assumptions and being open-minded and willing to consider any cause or approach to doing good. We\u2019re not perfect at applying these principles, but we try hard, and we\u2019re drawn to other people and organizations who do the same.</p><p>Effective altruists engage seriously with the question of how to do the most good through giving. They answer it as well as they can and seek to improve from there. We tend to learn a lot from people with this mindset, in terms of sparking ideas and helping us question our assumptions and arrive at better-informed views on the question of where to give.</p><p>Learning is the goal of the <a href=\"http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/conversations\">conversations we\u2019re having</a> and <a href=\"http://www.goodventures.org/our-portfolio\">grants we\u2019re making</a> today at Good Ventures. It\u2019s the goal of our <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/30/refining-the-goals-of-givewell-labs/\">partnership with GiveWell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/blog/co-funding-with-the-gates-foundation\">co-funding projects</a> with more experienced foundations. Sharing is an essential part of learning. If we can\u2019t share the information we\u2019re collecting publicly, it becomes less valuable to us, because it only has the potential to inform our decisions rather than the giving of any interested donor. We still find private conversations useful and choose to keep information confidential at times. But we aim to share as much as we can \u2014 via our website or GiveWell\u2019s \u2014 and our ability to share the details of our work is a factor we weigh heavily when making grant decisions.</p><p>We hope our approach bolsters the effective altruism movement by providing other donors with useful information and encouraging them to share as much as they can in turn. We hope to meet more people who are engaging seriously with the question of how to do the most good through giving. We don\u2019t expect the effective altruism community to converge around a single answer. We expect quite the opposite: more debate, faster learning and iteration, and more and better answers to the question of which charitable causes and approaches to philanthropy hold the most promise for improving our world.</p></div></div>"},

This does tend to involve some amount of sacrifice, but if I could have a larger impact with less sacrifice that would be a good thing.  In fact I <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/balancing-costs-to-ourselves-with-benefits-to-others\">choose my altruistic activities</a> to do as much as possible with as little sacrifice as possible.  So reactions like this confuse me:\n\n</p><blockquote>\nFor me, altruism should involve more than sparing the poor a few crumbs from our table.  It should be about changing our behaviour and trying to be nicer to the people we find most irritating. Peter Singer's Effective Altruism doesn't address this aspect of good living at all. His movement is just about doing stuff with money. It's a cult for wealthy middle-class Westerners who don't want to change their behaviour but feel a bit guilty about the comfort they live in. The Effective Altruism movement allows its followers to continue their privileged existences\u2014they buy themselves absolution by signing a direct debit docket to one of the EA-authorised charities. True altruism involves self-sacrifice; Singer's altruism involves salary sacrifice and nothing more. (<a href=\"http://overland.org.au/2013/09/affective-altruism/\">source</a>)\n</blockquote>\n\nIf I were talking to this writer in person I would suggest we <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/nu/taboo_your_words/\">taboo</a> the word \"altruism\" and talk at a lower level.  They would probably expand \"altruism\" to something like \"making substantial sacrifices for the benefit of others\" while I would expand it to just \"working to benefit others\".  We could go on from there to discuss why they think \"making substantial sacrifices\" is important in and of itself, to the point of not valuing an approach that \"involves salary sacrifice and nothing more.\"  Maybe we would reach an agreement, maybe we wouldn't, but we'd get closer to understanding what we disagreed about.\n<p>\n\nAs participants in a broader discourse around \"altruism\", however, we should push for an understanding of the term that isn't about giving things up.  Someone who <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/charles-gray-world-equity-man\">reduces their income to the level of world per-capita GDP</a> or <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/04/01/cnnheroes.krishnan.hunger/index.html\">works in 100 degree temperatures hand-delivering meals to homeless people</a> is engaging in intense self-sacrifice, but what matters is how much they're helping.\n\n<em>Crossposted from Jeff Kaufman's <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/altruism-isnt-about-sacrifice\">blog</a></em></p></div></div>"},

As Holden writes, \"The most efficient markets can be consistently beaten only by the most talented/dedicated players, while the least efficient [markets] can be beaten with fairly little in the way of talent and dedication.\"</p><p>Moreover, market efficiency is multi-dimensional. Any particular market may be efficient in some ways, and in some domains, while highly inefficient in other ways and other domains.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"Charity_as_an_inefficient_market\">Charity as an inefficient market</h2><p></p><p>Financial markets are relatively efficient. It's rare for players to consistently beat the market by a large margin. You can beat the average by investing in a <a href=\"https://personal.vanguard.com/us/whatweoffer/mutualfundinvesting/indexfunds\">low-fee index fund</a>, but not by a lot, and it's hard to beat hedge funds.</p><p>Philanthropic markets appear to be less efficient than financial markets in many ways. In charity, one can consistently beat the market by a wide margin simply by giving to <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell's recommended charities</a>, which achieve far greater returns (in social value) per marginal dollar than the average charity does. However, Holden <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/\">points out</a> that it has been surprisingly difficult for GiveWell to find ways to beat <em>well-run large foundations</em> like the <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/\">Gates Foundation</a>'s work in global health.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"Why_should_we_expect_charity_to_be_less_efficient_than_financial_markets_\">Why should we expect charity to be less efficient than financial markets?</h2><p></p><p>For one thing, most people giving to charity don't even seem to <em>care</em> what returns (in social value) they're getting with their investments. That's why, when proto-GiveWell initially contacted a bunch of charities to ask for evidence of positive impact, some of those charities reported that nobody who gave them money had ever <em>asked</em> that question before. And when charities sent proto-GiveWell their internal reports about effectiveness, they were so inadequate that they \"led [proto-GiveWell] to understand that the charities <em>themselves</em> did not know whether they were helping or hurting a given situation\" (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/With-Charity-All-Charities-Failing/dp/038553471X/\">Stern 2012</a>).</p><p>For another thing, \"market incentives of the nonprofit world push charities toward happy anecdote and inspiring narrative rather than toward careful planning, research, and evidence-based investments\" (details <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/With-Charity-All-Charities-Failing/dp/038553471X/\">here</a>).</p><p>Also, as Brian Tomasik <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/comment-page-1/#comment-542070\">notes</a>, \"Efficiency in the realm of charity is inherently less plausible than in financial markets because in charity there\u2019s not a common unit of what 'good' means... Indeed, one man\u2019s good may be another man\u2019s bad (e.g., abortion, gun control, extinction risks).\" But even when we focus on relatively common units of 'good' (e.g. human welfare, QALYs, or DALYs), charity is still relatively inefficient: we can easily purchase more QALYs per dollar via <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF\">AMF</a> than via, say, the popular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make-A-Wish_Foundation\">Make-a-Wish Foundation</a>.\n</p><h2 id=\"What_is__broad_market_efficiency___then_\">What is \"broad market efficiency\", then?</h2>\nIf Holden agrees that philanthropic markets are relatively inefficient in the sense that it's easy to consistently and substantially beat average market returns by giving to GiveWell's recommended charities, then what does he mean by \"broad market efficiency\"? Holden introduces \"broad market efficiency\" as a term for the <em>spectrum</em> of market efficiency, but remains uncertain as to where charity falls on that spectrum of market efficiency.<p></p><p>Brian Tomasik <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/comment-page-1/#comment-542070\">worried</a> that the term \"broad market efficiency\" would confuse some readers into thinking Holden was claiming that philanthropic markets are relatively efficient and thus that \"it doesn\u2019t really matter where you donate.\" Holden <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/comment-page-1/#comment-542975\">said</a> he wasn't worried about this, saying, \"I don\u2019t think 'broad market efficiency' is a common phrase or one with a clear meaning.\" But I think the phrase <em>is</em> confusing, that many readers interpret it as meaning \"market efficiency,\" and indeed that people in economics and finance sometimes use it that way: search for the phrase \"broad market efficiency\" <a href=\"%5Bhttps://www2.blackrock.com/webcore/litService/search/getDocument.seam?venue=PUB_INS&amp;source=CONTENT&amp;ServiceName=PublicServiceView&amp;ContentID=1111183580%5D(http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Singal-Beyond-the-Random-Walk-Preface.pdf\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Blackrock-Securities-Lending-unlocking-the-full-potential-of-investment-porfolios.pdf\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Ooi-et-al-Extrapolation-theory-and-hte-pricing-of-REIT-stocks.pdf\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.greaterfool.ca/2011/04/10/depraved/#comment-94887\">here</a>.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"The_research_ahead\">The research ahead</h2><p></p><p>So how efficient <em>is</em> the charitable market, and in which ways?

{"date": "19th Jul 2013", "title": "Haiti and disaster relief", "author": "Jeff_Kaufman", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>A few months ago the New York Times published an article about the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/world/americas/in-aiding-quake-battered-haiti-lofty-hopes-and-hard-truths.html?hp&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;\">disappointing progress of relief and recovery</a> after the Haitian earthquake. Three years in, with nearly $10 billion donated, Haiti is still a mess: how can the international community have failed so badly?</p><p>The truth is, helping people in the aftermath of a disaster is extremely difficult. The resources of a healthy society that a charity could otherwise draw on are stretched to the breaking point or beyond. A major natural disaster like Haiti's earthquake can destroy the ports you need to bring in supplies and the roads you need to transport them. Hospitals that would be available are damaged or crowded beyond capacity. The government is overtaxed and past its ability to coordinate effectively. This doesn't mean that immediate aid is impossible, or that the need isn't great, but money spent after a disaster doesn't go nearly as far as it could if it were spent at other times or in other places.</p><p>Rebuilding after a disaster has less of these issues, but still has problems of its own. You're trying to accomplish twin goals: putting things back how they were before the disaster and making people better off. While these aren't generally at odds with each other, they're also not generally going to be best accomplished by the same projects. For example you might be dividing funds between building permanent housing and hygiene education. The housing clearly helps recover from the disaster while hygiene is working on a problem that, while certainly exacerbated by the disaster, was an issue before and is only partly related. Yet housing is very expensive for the amount it helps people while hygiene promotion is both cheap and effective. [1] This puts aid organizations in a very awkward position: people are donating because they want to help the people affected by the disaster rebuild and move on, but often the opportunities to help people the most are in other problems that existed before the disaster.</p><p>With this in mind, it is frustrating to read an article that in every tradeoff focuses on the negative, even to the point of arguing against both sides when a situation comes up repeatedly. For example, they first point out the harm of delay in school construction and transportation improvement:\n</p><blockquote>Surrounded by half-built cinder-block walls, jutting rebar and piles of stone and sand, some 480 students cram into 10 makeshift classrooms illuminated only by the natural light that seeps through the gap between the partial walls and the tin roofs. Then, no strangers to life's setbacks, they trudge miles home over muddy, treacherous mountain roads as darkness descends.</blockquote>\nOnly paragraphs later, however, they object to the amount of aid money spent on:\n<blockquote>... big-ticket, multiyear projects that were not directly related to the earthquake, among them improving the education system, developing agriculture in central Haiti and building roads all over the country.</blockquote>\nGranting that much of the negativity of the article is warranted, however, in that the money spent on earthquake relief really hasn't gone very far, it's illuminating to look at GiveWell's <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2010/01/13/haiti-earthquake-donations/\">blog post</a> from the day after the quake:\n<blockquote>According to the Disease Control Priorities Project, emergency aid is one of the worst uses of donations, despite being one of the most emotionally compelling. For more, see our post on <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2008/08/29/the-case-against-disaster-relief/\">the cost-effectiveness of disaster-focused aid</a>.</blockquote>\nIn short, disasters aren't where you can do the most good with the money you can donate. The next time there's a major disaster, perhaps try to focus the emotion of the tragedy into giving to a <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">well-reviewed charity</a> working on a problem that is less likely to make the news.<p></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "5th Jul 2013", "title": "Spending on yourself vs. charity", "author": "Ben_Kuhn", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>When people first hear about the idea of effective altruism, especially from someone like Peter Singer, there\u2019s one particular objection that is often raised. It goes something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Peter Singer suggests that if I see a child drowning in a pond, I would probably jump in and save them even if I\u2019m wearing $500 non-waterproof boots. He concludes that because of this, I should donate $500 to charity, where it can save a child\u2019s life. But what happens if you take this to its logical conclusion? I would spend all my money on charity and live in a cardboard box! And you can\u2019t expect me to do that! I guess I\u2019m not going to listen to Peter Singer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(I know this is a common objection because I used it to dismiss Peter Singer for two years before I realized that there might be a <em>reason</em> that he himself spent money on things like suits and a house. So if you are talking to someone about effective altruism, be aware of this!)</p>\n<p>The problem with this objection is that it takes a very short-term view of optimizing the size of your donation, because it takes money to earn money. If you donate your entire income (and assets) to the Against Malaria Foundation this year and go live in a cardboard box, then your income will be much smaller next year, because nobody wants to hire people who live in cardboard boxes.</p>\n<p>In fact, pretty much every donation that would otherwise be spent on solving a problem in your own life has some opportunity cost, even if the problem it\u2019s solving doesn\u2019t directly cost you very much time or money. This is because even for relatively small problems, if you don\u2019t solve them, they will take up your attention while you worry about them. Attention can otherwise be spent on doing valuable things, which can be converted into money.</p>\n<p>In fact, the rate can be quite high. For instance, I recently bought a second monitor. If I were carrying it on my back and saw a drowning child, I would jump into the pond, save the child, and fry the monitor. But then I would go buy another monitor, because I realized that if I\u2019m switching back and forth between programming, documentation, and other windows all the time, the ones in the background consume nagging bits of attention and I get a lot worse at doing high-value tasks like programming. I calculate that given my hourly wage, if my second monitor makes me even 1% better at programming because I can keep track of more things, it will pay for itself in less than a year, so it\u2019s a definite win.</p>\n<p>Now, there\u2019s definitely some inflection point of wealth at which you should stop spending money to solve your own problems, because they\u2019re so minor it\u2019s just not worth it. And I agree with Peter Singer that this point is lower than most people think it is (since day-to-day well-being stops rising with incomes over $75,000, (<sup><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>) we might infer that much of the money people spend on themselves doesn\u2019t help at all with solving their own problems and could be redirected harmlessly). But I think this inflection point is also a fair amount higher than a naive reading of Singer\u2019s diving-into-the-pond example would imply, and it\u2019s important to make this clear when introducing this argument.</p>\n<div>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Kahneman, Daniel, and Angus Deaton. 2010. \u201cHigh Income Improves Evaluation of Life but Not Emotional Well-being.\u201d Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 107 (38) (September 21): 16489\u201316493. doi:<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.1011492107\">10.1073/pnas.1011492107</a>.\u00a0<a href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\">\u21a9</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div></div></div>"},

These people tend to start a bunch of discussions about their favored intervention, don\u2019t talk very much about anything else, and argue very forcefully for their point of view. This causes the community at large to ignore them, which is (understandably) upsetting: it seems hypocritical for the effective altruism community to claim to value a spirit of open-minded inquiry and then go around shunning outsiders who are arguing for a particular intervention.</p>\n<p>I think it\u2019s very important that we learn to talk to outsiders productively. And I largely understand where outsiders are coming from: from their perspective, the EA community looks like an amazing untapped resource they could be using for their preferred cause! And it\u2019s so amazing that they need to <em>push really hard</em> to mobilize it. Here\u2019s my attempt at explaining why that\u2019s a bad strategy, even though their intervention of choice is probably awesome.</p>\n<p>Right now the EA movement is very young. There are lots of interventions that seem promising, and there\u2019s not very much research on any of them. Even within the domain of global health and poverty, GiveWell has three interventions that it can\u2019t decide between, and they <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/09/12/why-givewell-labs/\">think</a> it\u2019s likely that global health isn\u2019t even the best option (just a good one that\u2019s easy to assess). When an organization as objective, rigorous, and thorough as GiveWell doesn\u2019t know which interventions will be the best, it makes us pretty skeptical of anyone else who claims to have certainty.</p>\n<p>Overall, there are four possible explanations for why such a person could disagree with what I\u2019ll call \u201cmainstream EA\u201d be really sure of an intervention.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>They have significantly different epistemological views from mainstream EA (I\u2019d say <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/\">MIRI</a> is an example of this, given their disagreement over <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html\">astronomical waste</a>);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>they have significant information that mainstream EA thought doesn\u2019t (obviously I can\u2019t cite examples here);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>they are avoiding significant biases that affect mainstream EAs (anti-aging research like <a href=\"http://www.sens.org/\">SENS</a> thinks it falls into this category);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>they aren\u2019t actually engaging with the idea of effective altruism and are just trying to use the existence of a group of enthusiastic people for their own ends.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hopefully, as an outsider think you belong to one of the first three. The problem is that the base rate of (4), as compared to the others, is <em>really high</em>, so you need a <em>ton</em> of evidence to outweigh that. And arguing repeatedly about your favored intervention actually isn\u2019t a good way to produce such evidence, since it\u2019s hard to make sufficiently persuasive arguments purely through text; furthermore, this plan is exactly what someone in (4) would come up with.</p>\n<p>Instead, the best kind of evidence that you fall into one of the first three categories would be trying to engage with the community on its own terms\u2014to cooperate in the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/9z/the_epistemic_prisoners_dilemma/\">epistemic prisoner\u2019s dilemma</a> that you and we fall into. For example, I was recently at the EA summit and Eliezer Yudkowsky (founder of MIRI) was also there. Honestly, I somewhat expected him to harp on AI risk for the whole conference. But even Eliezer was trying to contribute to EA thought on other topics\u2014see <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hvd/q_for_givewell_what_is_givedirectlys_mechanism_of/\">his new post on LessWrong</a> about <a href=\"http://www.givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a>. I think because he was willing to engage on other topics unrelated to AI risk, Eliezer actually ended up persuading more people about his views than he would have if he had soapboxed the entire time.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t mean to say that it\u2019s bad for outsiders to be enthusiastic about their intervention. Believing strongly in one thing can be a great motivator. (In fact, if you\u2019re very enthusiastic about getting EAs interested in something, maybe you could start doing some research of the type that GiveWell does on it! That would be super valuable.) It\u2019s just that from an outside view, it\u2019s very hard to distinguish people who have a reason to be confident from people who are trying to bend the EA community to their own goals.</p></div></div>"},

(<a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/effective-altruism\">More</a>)</p><p>I think such people fundamentally misunderstand effective altruism. I think they imagine that we have passions for particular causes, and are trying to submerge our passions in the service of rationality. That isn\u2019t the case. Rather, <strong>effective altruism is what we are passionate about</strong>. We\u2019re excited by the idea of making the most of our resources and helping others as much as possible.</p><p>This post focuses on my own attitude toward effective altruism, though I believe it is broadly shared by many others in the movement.</p><p>In a nutshell: trying to maximize the good I accomplish with both my hours and my dollars is an intellectually engaging challenge. It makes my life feel more meaningful and more important. It\u2019s a way of trying to have an impact and significance beyond my daily experience. In other words, it meets the sort of non-material needs that many people have.\n</p><h2 id=\"Effective_altruism_does_not_prioritize_intellect_over_emotion\">Effective altruism does not prioritize intellect over emotion</h2>\nWhen considering which particular causes I find interesting, I can\u2019t answer the question \u201cHow excited am I about the cause?\u201d without asking questions like \u201cHow important is the cause?\u201d and \u201cIs it already crowded with other funders?\u201d Throughout my life, my excitement to work on a problem has been directly related to how \u201cneglected\u201d the problem seems (relative to its importance). I\u2019d have trouble sustaining interest in a cause if I felt that I could do more good by switching to another.<p></p><p>I\u2019m not describing how I \u201cshould\u201d think or \u201ctry to\u201d think. I\u2019m describing what excites me. The causes I find most \u201cunder-invested in,\u201d and the general process of finding them, is what gets me out of bed in the morning excited to go to work. This excitement is what drove the all-nighters that started GiveWell, and I believe I couldn\u2019t be as motivated or put in as much effort on any other project.\n</p><h2 id=\"Effective_altruism_is_not_about_sacrifice\">Effective altruism is not about sacrifice</h2>\nI\u2019m always a bit put off when I see effective altruists being characterized as \u201cselfless\u201d or \u201csacrificing.\u201d Speaking for myself and Elie: we don\u2019t consider ourselves unusually \u201cselfless,\u201d and there has been no sacrifice whatsoever involved in our starting GiveWell. Compared to when we worked in finance, we find our work more interesting, more exciting, more motivating, and better for meeting people that we have strong connections with, all of which easily makes up for pay cuts that haven\u2019t much affected our lifestyles. I can\u2019t speak for people like <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/31/join-wall-street-save-the-world/\">Jason Trigg</a> or <a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/\">Julia Wise and Jeff Kaufman</a>, but <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/cheerfully\">Julia Wise\u2019s most recent post</a> implies that she sees altruism as a source of joy, not something for which joy is traded.<p></p><p>To anyone who\u2019s tempted to respond, \u201cI just don\u2019t believe that people can get excited about something like that,\u201d I\u2019d respond that there is a very wide range of things people are known to get excited about, many of which seem strange to outsiders. This is true of casual interests (bird-watching, stamp-collecting, spectator sports, fantasy sports) and of more serious interests, including a very wide variety of religious and spiritual values and practices. Some see effective altruism as more like a hobby, while others see it as more like a religious or spiritual value (or as implied by their religious or spiritual values); in all cases, effective altruists are engaging in the very common practice of having an interest that goes beyond their everyday lives and immediate needs. There\u2019s absolutely nothing unusual about caring a great deal about such an interest; giving up some tangible things for the sake of such an interest; and using intellectual reasoning in pursuing such an interest.</p><p>Athletes sometimes talk about \u201cgiving 110%\u201d or \u201cleaving it all on the field\u201d \u2013 they can\u2019t be satisfied with their effort if they feel they held anything back. I feel similarly about <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/05/02/strategic-cause-selection/\">strategic cause selection.</a> If I passed up an opportunity to do good because it didn\u2019t appeal to pre-existing personal interests, or because it involved too much abstract reasoning, I\u2019d feel as though I\u2019d failed to \u201cleave it all on the field.\u201d</p><p>Note that this doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m willing to give up everything else I value and enjoy for effective altruism \u2013 I\u2019m not. But when I\u2019m engaged in altruism-oriented activities, I want to be fully engaged.\n</p><h2 id=\"I_expect_the_effective_altruism_movement_to_grow\">I expect the effective altruism movement to grow</h2>\nSo far, I\u2019ve been somewhat surprised at how few people seem to share my interest in effective altruism. Many people want to help others, and many apply a great deal of both intellect and passion to doing so, but few seem to be asking the question: \u201cWhat issue should I work on in order to have as much positive impact as possible?\u201d<p></p><p>But my guess is that more people will be asking this question as time goes on. I believe that there are fairly robust trends in each of the following areas:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li>The world is becoming wealthier. More of us are securely able to satisfy our own material needs.</li>\n\t<li>The world is becoming more unequal. The differences between the privileged and the disadvantaged are reaching <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/11/the-moral-case-for-giving-doesnt-rely-on-questionable-quantitative-estimates/\">levels that seem to compel action</a>.</li>\n\t<li>The world is getting better at transmitting information. More than ever before, we have the tools to learn just how privileged we are, to learn what actions are available to us, to sort through the available information, and to make informed decisions. We also have the tools to transfer our resources across the world with high efficiency and precision.</li>\n</ul>\nToday, anyone with a spare $100 has the ability to learn how <a href=\"http://www.globalrichlist.com/\">relatively fortunate they are</a>, to learn about their many options for making a difference, and to take truly meaningful and impactful action. In such a world, I expect a growing number of people to be asking the question, \u201cHow can I make the most of this opportunity?\u201d And I hope they\u2019ll ask it not from a place of guilt and obligation, but from a place of self-actualization and excitement.<p></p><p><em>Crossposted from\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/20/excited-altruism/\"><em>The GiveWell Blog</em></a>\n</em></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "24th May 2013", "title": "On the robustness of cost-effectiveness estimates", "author": "William_MacAskill", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>A good post from Jonah Sinick on the Robustness of cost-effectiveness estimates <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hif/robustness_of_costeffectiveness_estimates_and/\">here</a>. In brief: GiveWell have consistently found that the cost-effectiveness estimates of the best interventions are too optimistic. This is a to-be-expected example of regression to the mean . But Jonah has found that this effect has occurred much more than he would have thought before he worked for GiveWell. So he urges you to go with more robust evidence of good but lower cost-effectiveness over less robust but higher cost-effectiveness, and suggests that this might be a mistake that EAs make more generally.</p><p>I'm pretty sympathetic to the thrust of the post, but I had a couple of immediate thoughts.</p><p>First, Jonah talks about \"lives saved per dollar\" - but what EAs are ultimately concerned about is \"good done per dollar\". But, for me, the amount of good I can do per dollar is far greater than I initially would have thought. This is because, in my initial analysis - and in what I'd presume are most people's initial analyses - benefits to the long-term future of civilisation weren't taken into account, or weren't thought to be morally relevant. (Example: saving a life doesn't just benefit that person, but also, because the person is economically productive, benefits all of society. Moreover, these economic benefits continue through the generations and in fact compound at a rate roughly equal to general economic growth). But those (expected) benefits strike me, and strike most people I've spoken with who agree with the moral relevance of them, to be far greater than the short-term benefits to the person whose life is saved. So, in terms of my expectations about how much good I can do in the world, I'm able to exceed those by a far greater amount than I'd previously thought likely. And that holds true whether it costs $2000 or $20000 to save a life. So the lesson to take from past updates on evidence can look quite different depending on whether you're talking about \"good done per dollar\" or \"lives saved per dollar\", and the former is what we ultimately care about.</p><p>Second, something Jonah doesn't mention is that, when you find out that your evidence is poorer than you'd thought, two general lessons are to pursue activities with high option value and to pay to gain new evidence (though this lesson do only follow if you think you can get a decent amount of new evidence in the future). Building a movement of people who are aiming to do the most good with their marginal resources, and who are trying to work out how best to do that, strikes me as a good way to achieve both of these things, and it's been a major factor in my decision to focus on building the effective altruism movement in general, rather than focusing on any one specific activity.</p></div></div>"},

I was asked to post the story of how I got involved with giving on The Life You Can Save website, so thought I'd post it here too.</p><p>It began in a graveyard. In May 2009, I first met Toby Ord \u2014 in the gardens of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, which double as a place for burying the dead. I'd read Peter Singer's work, and was terribly concerned by the problem of extreme poverty, and was looking for someone who was really taking these idea and putting them into practice. But I'd found that though almost all my philosophical colleagues agreed that Singer's arguments were correct, no-one was really living by them. I'd read on Toby's website that he said he was giving 'the required amount', but I was very sceptical about whether he really was.</p><p>In that conversation (\u201cgetting a coffee\u201d that lasted for 5 hours), though, he told me about his pledge to give everything he earned above \u00a320 000 per year to the charities that do the most good, and blew my mind.</p><p>I remember I expressed visible shock when he first told me. Feeling a bit taken aback, and entirely misunderstanding my reaction, he earnestly explained that the \u00a320 000 figure was a \u201chigh bar\u201d, and that really he gave much more than this \u2014 living on \u00a311 000, saving \u00a32 000, and donating the rest. He wanted to make sure he didn\u2019t publicly commit to a lower figure, he explained, so that he had some breathing space in case he faced any personal emergencies. But otherwise he would have committed to donating more.</p><p>It was at that point that I knew I was dealing with something new.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t most aid ineffective?\u201d I asked. \u201cHow do you know if it does any good?\u201d He went on to explain to me at length the different metrics for evaluating charity cost-effectiveness, how you can use research from health economics to find out which are the charities that are really having a massive impact. He told me that by donating to the very most cost-effective charities, you can save a life for mere thousands of dollars. It turned out that he\u2019d spent several years researching this question. \u201cHundreds of lives are on the line,\u201d he told me. \u201cSo it\u2019s important to get it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you choose the \u00a320 000 figure?\u201d He acknowledged that it was a little arbitrary. But he thought that it was better to have some fixed amount that he lived on, rather than have to decide every financial transaction on its own merits. He used to agonise over which type of cereal to buy every time he went to the supermarket \u2014 is this something that\u2019s worth the extra expense? \u2014 and he thought it would be better for his motivation in the long run just to make one commitment and stick with it.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your wife? She\u2019s a doctor, right? So will she be paying the bills?\u201d I really thought I\u2019d got him at this point \u2014 easy for him if he\u2019s got a high-earning spouse to live off. But then he explained politely that she was doing the same thing \u2014 giving everything about \u00a325,000. After that, I stopped trying to be critical and just accepted his story. He had it all thought out. I started to reflect on whether I could do the same, and what my worries about doing so were, so I asked one last question.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you feel like a sucker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cActually I think it\u2019s people who aren\u2019t doing this that are the suckers \u2014 many people care about global poverty, and want to help, and they\u2019re just not living up to their own values. I used to have a niggling feeling of guilt in the back of my mind \u2014 that I should be doing something, even though I wasn\u2019t. But I don\u2019t have that anymore. I\u2019m much happier now.\u201d</p><p>From then on, I was on board, and eagerly got involved in helping to set up Giving What We Can, and did quite a lot of the original cost-effectiveness research. I now give 10% of my PhD stipend, have pledged to give everything I earn above \u00a320,000, and want to dedicate my life to doing whatever does the most good.</p></div></div>"},
{"date": "10th Jun 2013", "title": "Common responses to earning to give", "author": "Ben_Kuhn", "num_comments": "1 comment", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><div>\n<p>Recently the Washington Post\u2019s <em>Wonkblog</em> had some in-depth <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/31/join-wall-street-save-the-world/?tid=ts_carousel\">coverage</a> of a bunch of people who are earning to give.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s really exciting to see effective altruism\u2019s ideas hitting the mainstream. This article in particular also has a very interesting new feature: a large comments section full of people who don\u2019t already agree with us.</p>\n<p>The level of discourse there is pretty low, but if we want the ideas behind effective altruism to spread thoroughly, they have to be able to survive in that kind of environment. So I decided it might be instructive to hold my nose, read the comments section and try to draw lessons about how we can refine our ideas for a wider audience.</p>\n<p>Reading through the negative responses, there are roughly five principal components of the objections. Some combination of these components accounted for all the attacks against earning to give that I saw (I read through the whole thread up to 12 PM on June 1st, although my eyes may have glazed over a couple of times). So here are the five main strains:</p>\n<h2 id=\"You_re_supporting_the_system_\">You\u2019re supporting the system!</h2>\n<p>One common response is that it\u2019s still not OK to participate in the Wall Street \u201csystem\u201d.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you make commodities more expensive through trading and excessive speculation, than donate your a portion of your profits to starving people, it\u2019s a bit disingenuous, because you are part of the reason that the price of their food is beyond their reach. \u2014<strong>mhdrgdajveeah</strong></p>\n<p>Nonsense. Wall Street is ruining this country. Dirty, rotten, greedy scum. All of them. So what if they give away some of their money. How about the hard working people who have been ruined by Wall Street? \u2014<strong>dubhlaoich</strong></p>\n<p>The problem you run into \u2014 </p>\n<p>If you are making the money by financing a company that is doing more harm than you can possibly do good from your profit. </p>\n<p>For instance a company may want to exploit emerging markets for tobacco products. \u2014<strong>Mark in Colorado</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These kind of retorts are why it\u2019s <em>very important</em> to mention <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/35-the-replaceability-effect-working-in-unethical-industries-part-1\">replaceability</a>: that if you don\u2019t work in an unethical industry, someone else will take your place. For a lot of people, after they hear the replaceability argument, it seems so obvious in retrospect that they don\u2019t mention it except as a counter-argument when they realize that other people haven\u2019t figured it out.</p>\n<p>But in fact, it seems replaceability (and more generally, thinking about marginal, rather than total, effects) is highly non-obvious to most people. So I think we need to talk about replaceability a lot more, especially in mainstream sources.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What_about_big_problem_x_\">What about big problem <em>x</em>?</h2>\n<p>This type of comment complains that those who are earning to give should be working on some piece of a bigger problem. In this case the main target is \u201cfixing the system\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I suppose that\u2019s noble to play against the greedy at their own game, but I\u2019d rather see the \u2018game\u2019 simply not exist. Or how about simply assessing a fair tax rate on trades, to support our government\u2019s efforts to eradicate malaria, among many other things? \u2014<strong>naomi94112</strong></p>\n<p>and, just what ecocide is being supported or expanded by the companies whose stocks are being blindly manipulated for profit? Wouldn\u2019t it be better to attempt to truly change the world by changing US policy toward the environment, for example? \u2014<strong>getsmart4</strong></p>\n<p>We need the smart, dedicated people who want to do the right thing to put their energies and talents directly into reforming a system that is dragging people down, or at least not enabling it. \u2014<strong>jgunne</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We need to emphasize more that <em>we care about these problems, we just can\u2019t do much about them.</em> Take financial reform. The financial industry currently records profits of about $120 billion a year (<a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/03/30/chart-of-the-day-us-financial-profits/\">source</a>). If proposed reforms halve those profits, the industry should be willing to spend up to $60 billion a year on lobbying to prevent such reform, which means we\u2019d need to muster the same kind of resources to pass such reform. That\u2019s about the total estimated cost of curing malaria by 2020 (<a href=\"http://www.rbm.who.int/gmap/2-5.html\">source</a>), every year. So just because something is a big problem, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best problem to work on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"You_should_attack_the_causes__not_the_symptoms_\">You should attack the causes, not the symptoms.</h2>\n<p>Another common argument is that solving disease is curing a symptom, not a cause.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve nothing against charity, but the belief that this sort of charity will \u201csave the world\u201d is naive and ignores the structural conditions that perpetuate poverty. So long as property and wealth continues to be concentrated in a small number of hands \u2014 Wall Street being emblematic of this \u2014 there will continue to be those deprived of the basic necessities of life. \u2014<strong>GeorgeStevens</strong></p>\n<p>I do find this talk about saving lives curiously bloodless. It\u2019s a little like pro-lifers forcing women to give birth to their fetuses, only for them (the pro-lifers) to walk away from the resulting infant and call back to them, \u201cYou\u2019re on your own now!\u201d These do-gooders are just kicking the can a little further down the road. \u2014<strong>barnesgene</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don\u2019t know too much about development economics, but I think there\u2019s a fairly clear response here: it\u2019s not a cause/symptom relationship, it\u2019s a vicious cycle. Poor countries have no health infrstructure, so they have high disease burd en, so they\u2019re economically disadvantaged, so they can\u2019t build health infrastructure. Attacking any portion of the loop is helpful, and disease happens to be the easiest to solve from outside.</p>\n<h2 id=\"But_we_can_t_ever_know_how_much_good_we_re_doing_\">But we can\u2019t ever <em>know</em> how much good we\u2019re doing!</h2>\n<p>The trend that is most annoying to me personally is the insistence that since we don\u2019t know things for sure, we shouldn\u2019t do anything.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it really ethical (or smart) to fund mosquito nets in lieu of a seeing eye dog on the premise that thousands of nets can be bought for one dog? Can they really know per-emptively [sic] the value will come from the distribution of those nets versus the placement of one service dog? And if they do know, what are the criteria that they use to justify their decision? Is it reasonable to assume that mosquito netting will make a contribution to African society in way that one seeing eye dog cannot make too somebody in this country? \u2014<strong>cleverrevolution</strong></p>\n<p>A lot of the comments stem from the ultimate problem with the sort of Utilitarian arguments Singer presents. Because of the incredible complexity of the world and the actions of our consequences, attempts to treat the maximization of minimal global goods often end in absurdity or obscurity. Which action, given the infinitude of unforeseeable consequences of any action, will maximize goods? Unfortunately, much more difficult to say than just \u2018save this girl!\u2019 Then, how far do you go? The best objection I\u2019ve seen in this vane is Parfit\u2019s repugnant conclusion. For those interested: <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/\">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclu\u2026</a> \u2014<strong>Calicles</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s not an accident that the only objecter actually to engage with philosophy fell under this category: the counter-argument is a bit more nuanced and difficult to explain. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to boil it down into a form that can survive and replicate in a comment thread\u2014though I think it\u2019s pretty important that we figure something out.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the basic form of the counter-argument is that, sure, we don\u2019t know what the end result will be, but we can make a really good guess. Good enough that using such estimates gets way, way better results than doing what feels intuitively right, or whatever other rule you\u2019re picking actions by. I\u2019ve been reading a lot of Slate Star Codex recently, so I\u2019ll refer interested readers to <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/02/if-its-worth-doing-its-worth-doing-with-made-up-statistics/\">Scott Alexander</a> for a more detailed analysis of this problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"But_deontology_virtue_ethics_\">But deontology/virtue ethics!</h2>\n<p>Possibly the most important thing we can learn from these comments is that lots of people just aren\u2019t consequentialists\u2014not even because of philosophical objections like Calicles, but because the default morality that most people grow up with isn\u2019t consequentialism.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don\u2019t know anything about hedge funds but isn\u2019t that generally unethical?? \nThe ends do not justify the means. \u2014<strong>GerriM</strong></p>\n<p>Oh, please. Saving the world is Jesus\u2019 job. Working on Wall Street makes you a financial industry employee, not a savior of anything. If you want to do the world some good, then act like a man. Remember manhood? Remember value? Remember not speculating and gambling, but building and constructing? Stop ripping people off with fake math. Call it like it is.  </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not the money, but the merit, that gives a man the glow of sunshine. </p>\n<p>Figure it out, kid. \u2014<strong>agx48</strong></p>\n<p>Trigg\u2019s mistake is dicounting the human element that makes his money able to do something. Without the human element the money doesn\u2019t make a difference. Such a petulant child. \u2014<strong>Frazil</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this might be the most important objection to get better at answering\u2014not only to get people to accept earning to give, but to raise the sanity waterline more generally. I hope to touch more on what exactly is going on with these commenters in a future post. But the upshot is that making consequentialism more viscerally appealing to people is a really important thing to do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This is only intended to be one step in the process of responding to mainstream views of earning to give. I don\u2019t have very many thoughts yet about how to make effective-altruism memes more resilient to objections like these. I mostly just want to do the legwork of categorizing the most common objections, so that more skilled rhetoricians than I can figure out how to spread memes that answer them.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/etg-objections\">Ben Kuhn's blog</a></em>\n</p>\n</div></div></div>"},

Because my values are roughly aligned with their aggregate preferences, I expect them to create a rich and valuable world (by my lights as well as theirs).</li>\n<li>Some people in the future will have altruistic values broadly similar to my own, and will use their influence to create a rich and valuable world (by my lights as well as theirs).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Which of these pictures we take more seriously has implications for what we should do today. I often have object level disagreements which seem to boil down to disagreement about which of these pictures is more important, but rarely do I see serious discussion of that question. (When there is discussion, it seems to turn into a contest of political ideologies rather than facts.)<span></span></p>\n<p>If we take picture (1) seriously, we may be interested in ensuring that society continues to function smoothly, that people are aware of and pursue what really makes them happy, that governments are effective, markets are efficient, externalities are successfully managed, etc. If we take picture (2) seriously, we are more likely to be concerned with changing what the people of the future value, bolstering the influence of people who share our values, and ensuring that altruists are equipped to embark on their projects successfully.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m mostly concerned with the very long run\u2014I am wondering what conditions will prevail for most of the people who live in the future, and I expect most of them to be alive very far from now.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that there are two major factors that control the relative importance of pictures (1) and (2): how prominent should we expect altruism to be in the future, and how efficiently are altruistic vs. selfish resources being used to create value? My answer to the second question is mostly vague hand-waving, but I think I have something interesting to say on the first question.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How_much_altruism_do_we_expect_\"><b>How much altruism do we expect?</b></h2>\n<p>I often hear people talking about the future, and the present for that matter, as if we are falling towards a Darwinian attractor of cutthroat competition and vanishing empathy (at least as a default presumption, which might be averted by an extraordinary effort). I think this picture is essentially mistaken, and my median expectation is that the future is much <i>more</i> altruistic than the present.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Dose_natural_selection_select_for_self_interest_\"><b>Dose natural selection select for self-interest?</b></h3>\n<p>In the world of today, it may seem that humans are essentially driven by self-interest, that this self-interest was a necessary product of evolution, that good deeds are principally pursued instrumentally in service of self-interest, and that altruism only exists at all because it is too hard for humans to maintain a believable sociopathic facade.</p>\n<p>If we take this situation and project it towards a future in which evolution has had more time to run its course, creating automations and organizations less and less constrained by folk morality, we may anticipate an outcome in which natural selection has stripped away all empathy in favor of self-interest and effective manipulation. Some may view this outcome as unfortunate but inevitable, others may view it as a catastrophe which we should work to avert, and still others might view it as a positive outcome in which individuals are free to bargain amongst themselves and create a world which serves their collective interest.</p>\n<p>But evolution itself does not actually seem to favor self-interest at all. <i>No matter what your values</i>, if you care about the future you are incentivized to survive, to acquire resources for yourself and your descendants, to defend yourself from predation, etc. etc. If I care about filling the universe with happy people and you care about filling the universe with copies of yourself, I\u2019m not going to set out by trying to make people happy while allowing you and your descendants to expand throughout the universe unchecked. Instead, I will pursue a similar strategy of resource acquisition (or coordinate with others to stop your expansion), to ensure that I maintain a reasonable share of the available resources which I can eventually spend to help shape a world I consider value. (See <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2012/09/spreading-happiness-to-stars-seems.html\">here</a> for a similar discussion.)</p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t seem to match up with what we\u2019ve seen historically, so if I claim that it\u2019s relevant to the future I have some explaining to do.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Historical_distortions\"><b>Historical distortions</b></h3>\n<h4 id=\"Short_range_consequentialism\"><i>Short-range consequentialism</i></h4>\n<p>One reason we haven\u2019t seen this phenomenon historically is that animals don\u2019t actually make decisions by backwards-chaining from a desired outcome. When animals (including humans) engage in goal-oriented behavior, it tends to be pretty local, without concern for consequences which are distant in time or space. To the extent that animal behavior is goal-oriented at a large scale, those goals are largely an emergent property of an interacting network of drives, heuristics, etc. So we should expect animals to have goals which lead them to multiply and acquire resources, even when those drives are pursued short-sightedly. And indeed, that\u2019s what we see. But it\u2019s not the fault of evolution alone\u2014it is a product of evolution <i>given</i> nature\u2019s inability to create consequentialist reasoners.</p>\n<p>Casually, we seem to observe a similar situation with respect to human organizations\u2014organizations which value expansion for its own sake (or one of its immediate consequences) are able to expand aggressively, while organizations which don\u2019t value expansion have a much harder time deciding to expand for instrumental reasons without compromising their values.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, this situation is exceptional in history. If humans ever manage to build systems which are properly consequentialist\u2014organizations or automations which are capable of expanding because it is <i>instrumentally</i> useful\u2014we should not expect natural selection to discriminate at all on the basis of those systems\u2019 values.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Value_drift\"><i>Value drift</i></h4>\n<p>Human\u2019s values are also distorted by the process of reproduction. A perfect consequentialist would prefer to have descendants who share their values. (Even if I value diversity or freedom of choice, I would like my children to at least share those values, at least if I want that freedom and diversity to last more than one generation!) But humans don\u2019t have this option\u2014the only way we can expand our influence is by creating very lossy copies. And so each generation is populated by a fresh batch of humans with a fresh set of values, and the values of our ancestors only have an extremely indirect effect on the world of today.</p>\n<p>Again, a similar problem afflicts human organizations. If I create a foundation that I would like to persist for generations, the only way it can expand its influence is by hiring new staff. And since those staff have a strong influence over what my foundation will do, the implicit values of my foundation will slowly but surely be pulled back to the values of the pool of human employees that I have to draw from.</p>\n<p>These constraints distort evolution, causing selection to act only those traits which can be reliably passed on from one generation to the next. In particular, this exacerbates the problem from the preceding section\u2014even to the extent that humans <i>can</i> engage in goal-oriented reasoning and expand their own influence instrumentally, these tendencies can not be very well encoded in genes or passed on to the next generation in other ways. This is perhaps the most fundamental change which would result from the development of machine intelligences. If it were possible to directly control the characteristics and values of the next generation, evolution would be able to act on those characteristics and values directly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"So_what_does_natural_selection_select_for_\"><b>So what <i>does</i> natural selection select for?</b></h3>\n<p>If the next generation is created by the current generation, guided by the current generation\u2019s values, then the properties of the next generation will be disproportionately affected by those who care most strongly about the future.</p>\n<p>In finance: if investors have different time preferences, those who are more patient will make higher returns and eventually accumulate much wealth. In demographics: if some people care more about the future, they may have more kids as a way to influence it, and therefore be overrepresented in future generations. In government: if some people care about what government looks like in 100 years, they will use their political influence to shape what the government looks like in 100 years rather than trying to win victories today.</p>\n<p>What natural selection selects for is patience. In a thousand years, given efficient natural selection, the most influential people will be those who today cared what happens in a thousand years. Preferences about what happens to <i>me</i> (at least for a narrow conception of personal identity) will eventually die off, dominated by preferences about what society looks like on the longest timescales.</p>\n<p>I think this picture is reasonably robust. There are ways that natural selection (/ efficient markets) can be frustrated, and I would not be <i>too</i> surprised if these frustrations persisted indefinitely, but nevertheless this dynamic seems like one of the most solid features of an uncertain future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"What_values_are_we_starting_with_\"><b>What values are we starting with?</b></h3>\n<p>Most of people\u2019s preferences today seem to concern what happens to them in the near term. If we take the above picture seriously, these values will eventually have little influence over society. Then the question becomes: if we focus only on humanity\u2019s collective preferences <i>over the long term</i>, what do those preferences look like? (Trying to characterize preferences as \u201caltruistic\u201d or not no longer seems useful as we zoom in.)</p>\n<p>This is an empirical question, which I am not very well-equipped to value. But I can make a few observations that ring true to me (though my data is mostly drawn from academics and intellectuals, who may fail to be representative of normal people in important ways even after conditioning on the \u201cforward-looking\u201d part of people\u2019s values):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When people think about the far future (and thus when they articulate their preferences for the far future) they seem to engage a different mode of reasoning, more strongly optimized to produce socially praise-worthy (and thus prosocial) judgments. This might be characterized as a <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2013/02/beware-far-values.html\">bias</a>, but to the extent we can talk about human preferences at all they seem to be a result of these kinds of processes (and to the extent that I am using my own altruistic values to judge futures, they are produced by a similar process). This effect seems to persist even when we are not directly accountable for our actions.</li>\n<li>People mostly endorse their own enlightened preferences, and look discouragingly at attempts to lock-in hastily considered values (though they often seem to have overconfident views about what their enlightened preferences will look like, which admittedly might interfere with their attempts at reflection).</li>\n<li>I find myself sympathetic to very many people\u2019s accounts of their own preferences about the future, even where those accounts different significantly from my own. I would be surprised if the distribution of moral preferences was too scattered.</li>\n<li>To the extent that people care especially about their species, their nation, their family, themselves, etc. : they seem to be sensitive to fairness considerations (and rarely wish e.g. to spend a significant fraction of civilization\u2019s resources on themselves), their preferences seem to be only a modest distortion of aggregative values (wanting people with property X to flourish is not so different from wanting people to flourish, if property X is some random characteristic without moral significance), and human preferences seem to somewhat reliably drift in the direction of more universal concern as basic needs are addressed and more considerations are considered.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After cutting away all near-term interests, I expect that contemporary human society\u2019s collective preferences are similar to their stated moral preferences, with significant disagreement on many moral judgments. However, I expect that these values support reflection, that upon reflection the distribution of values is not too broad, and that for the most part these values are reasonably well-aligned. With successful bargaining, I expect a mixture of humanity\u2019s long-term interests to be only modestly (perhaps a factor of 10, probably not a factor of 1000) worse than my own values (as judged by my own values).</p>\n<p>Moreover, I have strong intuitions to emphasize those parts of my values which are <em>least</em> historically contingent. (I accept that all of my values are contingent, but am happier to accept those values that are contingent on my biological identity than those that are contingent on my experiences as a child, and happier to accept those that are contingent on my experiences as a child than those that are contingent on my current blood sugar.) And I have strong reciprocity intuitions that exacerbate this effect and lead me to be more supportive of my peers\u2019 values. These effects make me more optimistic about a world determined by humanity\u2019s aggregate preferences than I otherwise would be.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How_important_is_altruism_\"><b>How important is altruism?</b></h2>\n<p>(The answer to this question, unlike the first one, depends on your values: how important to what? I will answer from my own perspective. I have roughly aggregative values, and think that the goodness of a world with twice as many happy people is twice as high.)</p>\n<p>Even if we know a society\u2019s collective preferences, it is not obvious what their relative <i>importance</i> is. At what level of prevalence would the contributions of explicit altruism become the source of value? If altruists are 10% of the influence-weighted population, do the contributions of the altruists matter? What if altruists are 1% of the population? A priori, it seems clear that the explicit altruists should do <i>at least</i> as much good\u2013on the altruistic account\u2013as any other population (otherwise they could decide to jump ship and become objectivists, or whatever). But beyond that, it isn\u2019t clear that altruists should create <i>much</i> more value\u2013even on the altruistic account\u2013than people with other values.</p>\n<p>I suspect that explicit altruistic preferences create many times more value than self-interest or other nearly orthogonal preferences. So in addition to expecting a future in which altruistic preferences play a very large role, I think that altruistic preferences would be responsible for most of the value even if they controlled only 1% of the resources.</p>\n<p>One significant issue is population growth. Self-interest may lead people to create a world which is good for themselves, but it is unlikely to inspire people to create as many new people as they could, or use resources efficiently to support future generations. But it seems to me that the existence of large populations is a huge source of value. A barren universe is not a happy universe.</p>\n<p>A second issue is that population <i>characteristics</i> may also be an important factor in the goodness of the world, and self-interest is unlikely to lead people to ensure that each new generation has the sorts of characteristics which would cause them to lead happy lives. It may happen by good fortune that the future is full of people who are well-positioned to live rich lives, but I don\u2019t see any particular reason this would happen. Instead, we might have a future \u201cpopulation\u201d in which almost all resources support automation that doesn\u2019t experience anything, or a world full of minds which crave survival but experience no joy, or etc.; \u201cself-interest\u201d wouldn\u2019t lead any of these populations to change themselves to experience more happiness. It\u2019s not clear why we would avoid these outcomes except by a law of nature that said that productive people were happy people (which seems implausible to me) or by coordinating to avoid these outcomes.</p>\n<p>(If you have different values, such that there <em>is</em> a law [or at least guideline] of nature: \u201cproductive people are morally valuable people,\u201d then this analysis may not apply to you. I know several such people, but I have a hard time sympathizing with their ethics.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\"><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p>I think that the goodness of a world is mostly driven by the amount of explicit optimization that is going on to try and make the world good (this is all relative to my values, though a similar analysis seems to carry with respect to other aggregative values). This seems to be true even if relatively little optimization is going on. Fortunately, I also think that the future will be characterized by <i>much</i> higher influence for altruistic values. If I thought altruism was unlikely to win out, I would be concerned with changing that. As it is, I am instead more concerned with ensuring that the future proceeds without disruptions. (Though I still think it is worth it to try and increase the prevalence of altruism faster, most of all because this seems like a good approach to minimizing the probability of undesired disruptions.)</p>\n\n<p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/\">Rational Altruist</a></em></p></div></div>"},

I really have absolutely no idea what the correct answer is.</p><p>I\u2019ll just make one comment here, though: which is that using \u201cdiscount rate\u201d as a term to denote this issue could be pretty misleading. When economists discount future income, they apply a steady discount rate: if the discount rate is 3%, then receiving $1 is worth $1 at year0, $(1*0.97) at year1, $(1*0.97*0.97) at year2, and so on. But it\u2019s almost certain that an EA\u2019s discount rate should be variable. If I had to guess what my discount rate should be, I\u2019d put it at something like 30% for the next couple of years (because I think that it\u2019s a particularly critical time for effective altruism, which I think is a particularly important social movement), tailing down to something close to 0% (and maybe even going negative for a while) after 5 or 6 years (because then I expect the effects of having a bigger and better platform on which to talk about effective altruism to counterbalance the benefits of doing things earlier rather than later).</p></div></div>"},

{"date": "29th Aug 2013", "title": "Replaceability in altruism", "author": "Ben_Kuhn", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>I\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately about GiveWell\u2019s <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/03/21/trying-and-failing-to-find-more-funding-gaps-for-delivering-proven-cost-effective-interventions/\">difficulties</a> finding opportunities for funding. Shockingly enough, despite lots of inefficiencies in the market for other people\u2019s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QALY\">QALYs</a>, it turns out that if you get a group of impressive people to run a transparent charity with an evidence-based intervention, you will probably get funding. (Surprise!) This has led me to be <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/downgrading-confidence-earning-give\">unsure</a> about the effectiveness of having effective altruists donate to charities like GiveWell\u2019s recommended ones.</p><p>In other words, <strong>replaceability applies to altruistic decisions just as much as to career choice.</strong> While it\u2019s hard to get people fully into the mindset of effective altruism, there are some things, like funding proven charities where you can easily persuade outsiders to help. So, to maximize the leverage we get as altruists, we should focus on areas where replaceability applies the least. What are such comparative advantages for us?</p><p></p><h2 id=\"Starting_new_things\">Starting new things</h2><p></p><p>Starting a thing is scary. It takes a lot more additional agency and dedication than just donating a chunk of income. Fortunately, the EA community seems to select (somewhat) for agenty dedicated people, probably by dint of filtering for people who think \u201cI should try really hard to help people\u201d <em>and then start trying really hard</em>. For instance, people <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2013/03/why-it-should-be-easy-to-dominate-givewells-recommendations.html\">proposed</a> that a fundraising organization would be a highly cost-effective charity; one year after the linked article was published, <a href=\"http://www.effectivefundraising.net/\">it exists</a>.<sup><a href=\"#fn:dothings\">1</a></sup></p><p>Starting a thing doesn\u2019t have to be full-time, of course. There are probably many really helpful projects, both small and large, where actually doing the project would be more effective than earning money and paying someone else to do it. For instance, I and some other folks are exploring the possibility of developing web apps for the EA community. It seems valuable to have these apps built and maintained by people who care about EA, not just people who did it for hire\u2014valuable enough that I think we should do it ourselves.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"Working_for_EA_organizations\">Working for EA organizations</h2><p></p><p>All the EA organizations that I\u2019ve talked to have mentioned difficulty in finding people. This is despite the fact that I know many people in the movement who seem like they would be quite good candidates. I\u2019m wondering if this is because the earning-to-give meme has propagated so strongly that <em>everyone</em> decides they would rather earn money and fund someone else working there, and then they don\u2019t apply, leading to a shortage of qualified applicants. At any rate, few enough people have the required skills and attitudes to work at e.g. GiveWell, Giving What We Can or 80,000 Hours that it seems pretty non-replaceable.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"Building_community_ideology\">Building community/ideology</h2><p></p><p>So far, we\u2019ve done a great job of growing without compromising on intellectual standards. The Facebook group, for instance, is about six times the size it was when I joined, but the discussion is still lively and interesting. But we\u2019ll need to devote lots of resources to making sure this continues through the next few orders of magnitude, and that\u2019s not something we can easily outsource. There\u2019s some progress being made right now, on Wikipedia editing and discussion media, but I think we can do much more to ensure that as the community grows we maintain its high quality of thought.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"Being_risk_neutral_in_donations\">Being risk-neutral in donations</h2><p></p><p>Donors driven by signalling, prestige, or warm fuzzies tend to be unhappy when charities they donate to don\u2019t get results. But effective altruists know that individually, we should just be maximizing expected outcome, and if that requires a high-risk strategy, so be it. In other words, even if we\u2019re personally risk-averse <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2010-12-07\">we should be altruistically risk neutral</a>. This (hopefully) means that we can operate something like philanthropic venture capitalists\u2014fund pie-in-the-sky ventures that are too risky for most donors, and thus collect a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_premium\">risk premium</a> (paid in QALYs, not dollars, but it\u2019s the same idea).</p><p></p><h2 id=\"Funding_meta_things\">Funding meta things</h2><p></p><p>It\u2019s relatively easy for object-level effective interventions to get funds, because they can appeal to those even without the effective-altruist mindset.

So donations from effective altruists are much less replaceable.</p><p>Well, these are the things I can think of off the top of my head.

Someone recommended that we try to have a meta-evaluation to rank them, but on some further discussion it became apparent that that would be incredibly difficult to do.</p><p>The different organizations just don\u2019t have the same goals as each other. Many were \u201ceffective\u201d within their own standard of epistemology, but not in those of the others.

Upon launch in 2007 they promoted the idea that charities could be evaluated on the efficiency of money put in to the amount of \u201cgood\u201d outputted. This was backed up with research by the GiveWell team to identify and recognize the \u201cmost efficient\u201d charities. This made a lot of sense to many smart people, but soon things became quite complicated as groups also trying to \u201cdo the most good\u201d within charity evaluation emerged to somewhat compete with them.<p></p><p>GiveWell is reluctant to investigate animal welfare charities, seemingly because its founders value animals <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2010/12/27/animal-welfare-charities/\">substantially less than humans</a>. Other people have decided that animals are worth more in respect to humans than Givewell has indicated, and some of these have set up a \u201cGiveWell for Animals\u201d, or <strong><a href=\"http://www.effectiveanimalactivism.org/Evaluation\">Effective Animal Altruism</a></strong>. <strong>Aidgrade</strong> was established a semi-Givewell competitor and disagrees with them about the <a href=\"http://www.aidgrade.org/uncategorized/some-friendly-concerns-with-givewell\">proper methods to do charity evaluations</a>.\n</p><h2 id=\"Effective_altruism_funders\">Effective altruism funders</h2>\nThen come the more somewhat high-risk meta-charities that promote giving to Effective Altruist groups, like <strong>Giving What We Can</strong>, <strong>The Life You Can Save</strong>, and <strong>80,000 Hours</strong>. These groups are really interesting to me because on paper what they\u2019re doing seems to be working (Giving What We Can has estimated to be able to encourage the giving of around <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/getting-involved/donate\">$8 for every $1 donated to them</a>, for instance).<p></p><p>Yet from what I understand, GiveWell refuses to recommend any of these as top charities. My impression is that GiveWell finds it highly unlikely that any of these organizations are as effective as their recommended charities. Of course, many of these organizations exist on the assumption that they are. This area seems particularly awkward as all of these meta-charities promote GiveWell publicly, leading to <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-09-08/a-conversation-with-holden-karnofsky-co-founder-of-givewell-part-ii\">several</a> <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/172-interview-with-holden-karnofsky-co-founder-of-givewell\">interviews</a>. I imagine that it\u2019s better off for everyone that Givewell and CEA appear as close friends, yet internally it seems like there\u2019s a bit of tension over this stark disagreement on the need for CEA\u2019s existence. This disagreement is somewhat showcased in the comments <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/254-case-study-designing-a-new-organisation-that-might-be-more-effective-than-givewell-s-top-recommendation\">here</a>.</p><p>Also of note here is <strong><a href=\"http://www.effectivefundraising.net/\">Effective Fundraising</a></strong>. This group is directly writing grants for both the AMF (GiveWell\u2019s top choice) and the Humane League (Effective Animal Activism\u2019s top choice). They\u2019ve discussed why they split between them <a href=\"http://www.effectivefundraising.net/1/post/2013/08/how-we-select-our-charities.html\">here</a>. 80,000 Hours and CEA have interviewed them and written a blog post with a very nice name and slightly less praising contents. There\u2019s a bit of back and forth between them in the <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/254-case-study-designing-the-world-s-most-effective-charity\">comments</a>, which I referred to earlier.\n</p><h2 id=\"AI_risk_and_far_future_researchers\">AI risk and far future researchers</h2>\nGoing further, when coming to the topic of AI risk, things get much more\nconfusing. Organizations like <strong><a href=\"http://intelligence.org/\">MIRI</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">FHI</a></strong> claim that AI risk and other existential risks are by far the most important causes. Holden of Givewell wrote a very long critique <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/cbs/thoughts_on_the_singularity_institute_si/\">here</a>, which there\u2019s since been quite a bit of debate about. I suspect that incredibly few people actually have a deep understanding of the efficiencies or even importance of donating to prevent AI risk, and it is quite apparent that most donating will have to go with either a gut feeling or choose based on which social group they trust more.<p></p><p>Brian Tomasik has been a very interesting and rather independent thinker within the movement, known for his series of <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/\">Utilitarian Essays</a>. Even more than animal causes, he has numbers to recommend donating for <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/humane-insecticides.html\">insect causes</a> that make it seem like a fantastic area for efficient intervention. The main argument I\u2019ve heard from others against insect causes is that they seem intuitively silly, not that they aren\u2019t actually effective.</p><p>Recently Brian has made his own research institute called <strong><a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/where-i-recommend-donating.html\">FRI</a></strong> to focus on long term suffering reduction. Sure enough it\u2019s his number 1 recommended charity, but more surprisingly to me is that the number 2 isn\u2019t another similar far-future venture like MIRI or FHI, but instead <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/where-i-recommend-donating.html\">Animal Ethics</a>. I suppose he\u2019s both very concerned with the far future, but not very concerned with AI risk (the main reason he wouldn\u2019t recommend MIRI or FHI).</p><p>Another organization that comes to my mind is <strong>Leverage Research</strong>. I\u2019m not sure what category to put them in because they seem to be trying to do a bit of everything. However, I would point out that they appear to be the polar opposites of GiveWell regarding to belief in transparency, with all of the other organizations mentioned above are somewhat in between (with the possible exception of Effective Fundraising). My belief is that their expected method of doing the most good involves having a few smart people spend several years thinking about \u201cbig issues\u201d, without much care for outsider input (you\u2019ll notice a lack of much information on their <a href=\"http://www.leverageresearch.org/\">website</a>). These research topics seem to be more psychological and social than AI-risk, from what I understand. Most other EA organizations seem very skeptical of their research posted so far, mainly <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/el9/a_critique_of_leverage_researchs_connection_theory/\">Connection Theory</a>. However, a few people within Leverage run <a href=\"http://www.thehighimpactnetwork.org/\">Think!</a>, and they have created the <a href=\"http://www.effectivealtruismsummit.com/\">Effective Altruist Summit</a>, which has gotten good reviews.\n</p><h2 id=\"Future_organizations\">Future organizations</h2>\nI really hope that the issue of correct epistemology gets resolved and more of these organizations can at least agree on some standard ways of Effective Altruist Organization evaluation. But it seems unlikely to happen anytime soon.<p></p><p>The current trend from my point of view seems to be that every other new prominent Effective Altruist thinker will create a new organization to\nmatch another unique epistemology. I really hope that we don\u2019t get stuck with 20 different Charity Evaluators of slightly differing standards and 50 funding groups that randomly give to selections from those different evaluators, and another 10 Far Future groups that will emphasize slightly different things because of unique epistemological reasons. But given the fact that there is so much disagreement within what seems like such a small and intelligent group already, I could definitely see things going this way.</p><p>Granted, this still is a lot better than what is the global cultural norm right now. I would expect that most of the groups above average are far more useful than the global human average. But the global norm is pathetically low, so that shouldn\u2019t be considered too important. Within these groups, I\u2019d expect that many consider order of magnitude differences between them, so internal fragmentation may cause quite a bit of damage. And it\u2019s definitely confusing as anything to a newcomer who just wants to be an \u201cEfficient Altruist\u201d.\n</p><h3 id=\"Personal_bias\">Personal bias</h3>\nI should point out that I know people from most of the organizations mentioned, so probably am quite biased. I am presently working at 80,000 Hours, which is based in the same office as Giving What we Can, The Center For Effective Altruism, and The Future of Humanity Institute. Recently I applied to and was rejected from working at Leverage Research.\n<h3 id=\"Blog_efficiency\">Blog efficiency</h3>\nThis post took me about 5 hours to write. I ended up splitting my thoughts into two posts (leaving the rest for one more to come shortly). I\u2019ve tracked 4 Pomodoros in this time, but then I just kept on working for a few hours without tracking. I originally intended for this to be about 2 Pomodoros, but this was for a small comment about \u201cEpistemology as a Deus Ex Machina\u201d rather than a small EA Org overview.<p></p><p>My guess is that I\u2019ll dedicate at least another hour or two to checking stats of readership for this post and/or reading/responding to comments.</p><p><em>Crossposted from Ozzie Gooen's <a href=\"http://ozziegooen.com/blog/2013/09/21/navigating-the-epistemologies-of-effective-altruism/\">blog</a></em></p></div></div>"},

What I write should be read as a response to the article, rather than to MacAskill\u2019s views.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Variance_in_cost_effectiveness_of_charities\">Variance in cost-effectiveness of charities</strong></p>\n<p>MacAskill wrote</p>\n<p><em>\u2026 charities vary tremendously in the amount of good they do with the money they receive. For example, it costs about $40,000 to train and provide a guide dog for one person, but it costs less than $25 to cure one person of sight-destroying trachoma. For the cost of improving the life of one person with blindness, you can cure 1,000 people of it\u2026it\u2019s unlikely that you can work for only the very best charities. In contrast, if you earn to give, you can donate anywhere, preferably to the most cost-effective charities, and change your donations as often as you like.</em></p>\n<p>GiveWell has spent about five years looking for the best giving opportunities in global health, and its current #1 ranked charity is <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF\">Against Malaria Foundation</a> (AMF). GiveWell estimates that AMF <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Costperlifesaved\">saves an infant\u2019s life for ~ $2,300</a>, not counting other benefits. These other benefits not withstanding, AMF\u2019s cost per <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/additional/DALY\">DALY saved</a> is much higher than the implied cost per DALY saved associated with the figure cited for curing sight-destroying trachoma.</p>\n<p>GiveWell may have missed giving opportunities in global health that are much more cost-effective than AMF is, but given the amount of time, energy and attention that GiveWell spent on its search, one should have a strong prior against the possibility that one can easily find a better giving opportunity in global health. So a plausible estimate of the cost-effectiveness of donating to the best charity that delivers direct global health interventions is much lower than the above quotation suggests.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the phenomenon of the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hif/robustness_of_costeffectiveness_estimates_and/91j7\">optimizer\u2019s curse</a> suggests that all charities with robust case for fairly high cost-effectiveness are closer in cost-effectiveness to AMF than explicit cost-effectiveness calculations indicate. This narrows the variance in cost-effectiveness amongst charities.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So the advantage of being able to choose a charity to support and change at any time is smaller than the above quotation suggests.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Discrepancy_in_earnings\">Discrepancy in earnings</strong></p>\n<p>MacAskill wrote:</p>\n<p><em>Annual salaries in banking or investment start at $80,000 and grow to over $500,000 if you do well.

Only about 1% of Americans make ~$500k/year. There are some people who have a strong comparative advantage in finance, for whom \u201cearning to give\u201d to give may be especially compelling. But people who are able to make ~$500k/year in finance who <strong>don\u2019t</strong> have a large comparative advantage in finance have <strong>very strong transferable skills</strong>. Such people are significantly more capable than the average non-profit worker, and can plausibly have a bigger impact than 2 or 3 such workers by working directly on something with high social value.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Replaceability\">Replaceability</strong></p>\n<p>MacAskill wrote:</p>\n<p><em><span>\u2026\u201cmaking a difference\u201d requires<span>\u00a0</span></span></em><em><a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/18-just-what-is-making-a-difference-counterfactuals-and-career-choice\"><span>doing something that wouldn\u2019t have happened</span></a><span><span>\u00a0</span><span>anyway\u2026</span></span></em><em><span>The competition for not-for-profit jobs is fierce, and if someone else takes the job instead of you, he or she likely won\u2019t be much worse at it than you would have been.

I could easily imagine that this is the case for vaccination efforts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But funding opportunities for these interventions can be thought of as \u201clow hanging fruit.\u201d <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/\">Broad market efficiency</a> suggests that such interventions will be funded. And indeed, GiveWell has found that straightforward immunization efforts <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/03/21/trying-and-failing-to-find-more-funding-gaps-for-delivering-proven-cost-effective-interventions/\">are already largely funded</a>, to the point that GiveWell has been unable to find giving opportunities for individual donors in this area.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This suggests that at the margin, <strong>very high value humanitarian efforts require highly skilled and highly motivated laborers</strong>.</p>\n<p>High skilled laborers are a relatively small subset of laborers, so there are fewer people available to do these sorts of jobs than other jobs. Doing a hard, non-routine job well requires high motivation. <span>\u00a0</span>The collection of people who are sufficiently highly motivated to do a hard job with high social value that doesn\u2019t pay well, and who could otherwise be making much more money, largely consists of people who are trying to have a significant positive social impact.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So suppose that you\u2019re a highly skilled laborer deciding whether to \u201cearn to give\u201d or take a job with high social value that requires high skills and motivation. If you don\u2019t take the job with high social value, your counterfactual replacement is likely be one of the following:<br> </p>\n<p><span><span>1.<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></span>Substantially less capable than you on account of having low skills, or low altruistic motivation.</p>\n<p><span><span>2.<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></span>A highly skilled person with high motivation, <em>who would be doing something else with high social value if you had taken the job, and who can\u2019t do this because they have to do the job that you would have done</em>.</p>\n<p><span><span>3.<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></span></span>Nonexistent.</p>\n<p>So the replaceability consideration carries less weight than it might seem.</p>\n<p>Admittedly there\u2019s a counterconsideration \u2014\u00a0broad market efficiency cuts both ways, and one could imagine that the low hanging fruit in <em>working directly on projects with high social valu</em>e is also plucked, and this counter-consideration pushes in favor of \u201cearning to give.\u201d I have a fairly strong intuition that \u201cif you don\u2019t fund it, somebody else will\u201d is more true than \u201cif you don\u2019t do it, somebody else will\u201d so that this counter-consideration is outweighed. It\u2019s important to note that many projects of high social value are the first of their kind, and that finding somebody else to execute such a project is highly nontrivial. I think that it\u2019s also relevant that <a href=\"http://givingpledge.org/\">114 billionaires</a> have signed the Giving Pledge, committing to giving 50+% of their wealth away in their lifetimes.<span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>In any case, there isn\u2019t a clear-cut, unconditional argument that favors \u201cearning to give\u201d: whether \u201cearning to give\u201d is the best option very much depends on nuanced empirical considerations rather than a general abstract argument.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Other_important_considerations_that_favor_an_altruistic_career\"><span>Other important considerations that favor an altruistic career</span></strong></p>\n<p>There are additional important considerations that favor pursuing a career with high social value over \u201cearning to give\u201d:</p>\n<p><strong>Asymmetric implications of the existence of small probability failure modes</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hif/robustness_of_costeffectiveness_estimates_and/\">Robustness of Cost-Effectiveness Estimates and Philanthropy</a>, I described how a large collection of small probability failure modes conspires to substantially reduce the expected value of a funding opportunity. The same issue applies to choosing a narrow career goal with a view toward directly having a high positive social impact. But <strong>a worker has more capacity than a donor does to learn whether small probability failure modes prevail in practice, and can switch to a different job if he or she finds that such a failure mode prevails.</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example. Suppose that you go to medical school with a view toward the possibility of performing cleft palate surgeries in the developing world. It\u2019s probably the case that the opportunity isn\u2019t as promising as it seems. But if you try it, then you\u2019ll be able to see how effective the intervention is firsthand. If it\u2019s highly effective, then you can keep doing it. If it\u2019s not highly effective, then you can explore other possibilities, such as\u00a0</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Starting your own surgery organization.</li>\n<li>Switching to doing a different kind of surgery in the developing world, such as cataract removal.</li>\n<li>Working in a poor community in the developed world (which could have a bigger impact than working in the developing world owing to <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">flow-through effects</a>).</li>\n<li>Working for a biotech company.</li>\n<li>Getting involved in clinical medical research.</li>\n<li>Other things that haven't occurred to me.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By experimenting, one can hope to hone in on a job that has both high ostensible cost-effectiveness, and and a relatively small mass of small probability failure modes.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Altruistic_careers_extend_beyond_the_nonprofit_world\">Altruistic careers extend beyond the nonprofit world</strong></p>\n<p>Even on the assumption that \u201cearning to give\u201d is better than working at a nonprofit, it doesn\u2019t follow that \u201cearning to give\u201d optimizes social impact.

I don\u2019t think that Bill Gates contributed 10x as much as Steve Jobs to technology, and I don\u2019t think that Jobs could have had a bigger social impact by donating than through his work (which had massive positive <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">flow-through effects</a>).

This could be attributable to irrationality or to low altruism, but my experience is that there are many people who care about global welfare, or just welfare within a specific cause, and many people who are highly intelligent. In light of the existence of\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority\">illusory superiority</a>, one should be wary of holding an implicit view that one knows more about how to make the world a better place than the vast majority of the population.</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Steelmanning_wealth_maximization\"><span>Steelmanning wealth maximization</span></strong></p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth highlighting some factors that <em>favor</em> choosing a career with a view toward maximizing wealth in some situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>Comparative advantage</strong> \u2014\u00a0Some people are unusually good at making money relative to doing other things.

If you thought that, then you might think that $1.25 isn\u2019t so bad, because money goes much further in developing countries.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the fact that the money goes further in such countries has already been taken into account. What \u201c$1.25 per day\u201d means is: people living on this amount consume the goods equivalent of what $1.25 could buy in the US in 2005. That is to say, the figure is purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted. That means we can work out how much, in actual money, people in Kenya live on below this line. In 2005, the purchasing power parity conversion factor was US$1 to 29.5 Kenyan Shillings. So $1.25 is about 37 Kenyan Shillings. At market exchange rate (today\u2019s rate, so again this is only a rough estimate), that\u2019s 44\u00a2.</p>\n<p>Because that\u2019s still talking about 2005 money, we want to adjust for inflation, so, assuming 3% inflation per year (again, keeping it rough), that\u2019s 56\u00a2. \u00a0So, in my view more accurately, we should say that the global poor, in Kenya at least - though other countries at an equivalent level of economic development have similar PPP conversion factors - live on 56\u00a2 per day. Jeez.</p>\n<p>However, the story doesn\u2019t end there, because \u201c$1.25/day\u201d doesn\u2019t refer to income. It is based on measurements of consumption. So when a person gather sticks from the forest for their own use \u2014 that counts as \u2018consumption\u2019. Similarly, as far as I understand it, any free services provided by the government count in this as well.</p>\n<p>So I think a more intuitive way to think about extreme poverty is: if you gave a Kenyan living below that poverty line 56\u00a2, you\u2019d have doubled what they can consume in a day.</p>\n<p>A lot of people who know this about the $1.25 a day line subsequently refuse to believe it. \u00a0I really struggle to believe it. Surely, if someone lived in the US on $1.25 a day, they would die! (I heard this argued in a conference on poverty by an academic who\u2019d written several articles on poverty.)</p>\n<p>If we\u2019re referring to income, I think that\u2019s simply not true. With an income of $1.25 a day you could have a much better quality of life than the extremely poor. You can dumpster dive and live off the excess of the affluent country; they have free access to roads and lighting, a good legal system and police protection, and medical assistance if they get sick. I know someone who lived on $1000 per year for a couple of years \u2014 several times more than the extreme poor, but he had a really pretty reasonable quality of life.</p>\n<p>However, if you\u2019re thinking about consumption rather than income (as you should), there is a difference which does make the comparison to \u201c$1.25 living in the US\u201d misleading: in the US you just can\u2019t buy the sort of low-quality goods that you can in developing countries. Markets just don\u2019t exist for those goods. Even the most basic lentils and rice sold at Walmart in the US would be regarded as a luxury item for people living on $1.25 a day.</p></div></div>"},

{"date": "14th Aug 2013", "title": "Effective altruism", "author": "Holden_Karnofsky", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>We at GiveWell are proud to be part of the nascent \u201ceffective altruist\u201d movement. Effective altruism has been discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html\">Peter Singer\u2019s TED talk</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism\">Wikipedia</a>); this post gives our take on what it is and isn\u2019t.</p><p></p><h2 id=\"What_is_effective_altruism_\">What is effective altruism?</h2>\nTo us, \u201ceffective altruism\u201d means <strong>trying to do as much good as possible with each dollar and each hour that we have</strong>. It\u2019s a way of thinking about morality that insists on <em>maximization</em> of good accomplished, and not just <em>satisficing</em> of rules and guidelines. To us, this implies\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Focusing on how one\u2019s actions are likely to affect the world, rather than on how they affect oneself and one\u2019s feelings.</strong> Effective altruism is consistent with believing that giving benefits the giver, but it\u2019s not consistent with making this the driving goal of giving. Effective altruists often take pride in their willingness to give (either time or money) based on arguments that others might find too intellectual or abstract, and their refusal to give suboptimally even when a pitch is emotionally compelling. The primary/driving goal is to help others, not to feel good about oneself. (This doesn\u2019t mean that effective altruists aren\u2019t passionate about what they do or don\u2019t obtain emotional rewards; it means feeling this passion and obtaining these rewards comes from <em>focusing</em> on impact.)</li>\n\t<li><strong>Being open to working on any cause, rather than committing to a cause up-front based on pre-existing personal interests.</strong> <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/05/02/strategic-cause-selection/\">Strategic cause selection</a> is based on the notion that one can do much more good working on some issues than on others.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Thinking of all beliefs as being open to change, and therefore potentially worthy of debate and analysis.</strong> Effective altruists research and debate a broad range of topics, from <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/12/19/cost-effectiveness-of-nets-vs-deworming-vs-cash-transfers/\">estimates of how to improve lives as much as possible per dollar</a> to <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/\">how such estimates should be used</a> to <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/04/04/deep-value-judgments-and-worldview-characteristics/\">what counts as a life</a> to <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/20/give-now-or-give-later/\">whether it\u2019s better to give now or later</a> (and many more). The consequences of a shift in views \u2013 including on relatively abstract topics \u2013 can be large, so one should not take any questions \u201coff the table\u201d by declaring that only one answer is acceptable.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Being open to unconventional approaches to doing good.</strong> For example, effective altruists often choose to devote themselves to for-profit activities, perhaps because they\u2019re <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/06/26/our-take-on-earning-to-give/\">earning to give</a> and perhaps because they believe these activities are <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/15/flow-through-effects/\">themselves promising ways to improve the world</a>. Doing lucrative for-profit work isn\u2019t usually \u2013 or stereotypically \u2013 identified with being \u201chumanitarian\u201d or \u201caltruistic,\u201d but for effective altruists it can be a serious option.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Using one\u2019s investigative resources efficiently.</strong> We\u2019ll never have all the information we need to make knowably optimal decisions. Effective altruism means focusing one\u2019s debates, analysis and research on questions that will bear tangible fruit in terms of informing our decisions about how to accomplish good.\n<div>Different groups in the movement have different views of what this means. Some believe it is important to focus on <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/04/04/deep-value-judgments-and-worldview-characteristics/\">philosophical questions</a> (such as \u201cshould we value enabling a birth similarly to averting a death?\u201d) that seem in some sense \u201cfundamental\u201d and highly consequential in determining what outcomes we should aim for. We take a different view: we believe that questions like these, important though they may be, often aren\u2019t amenable to tangible progress through further investigation. We prefer to focus our resources on questions that combine \u201cimportance\u201d with \u201ctractability to further investigation.\u201d</div></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Effective_altruism_is_unusual_and_controversial\">Effective altruism is unusual and controversial</h2>\nTo many readers of this blog, the above qualities might sound like self-evidently good ones. But we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s how most people see them.<p></p><p>As GiveWell and Good Ventures have <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/05/02/strategic-cause-selection/\">explored what causes to get involved in</a>, the single most common advice we\u2019ve gotten has been to \u201cchoose what you\u2019re passionate about.\u201d When we\u2019ve described our desire to do \u201cstrategic cause selection\u201d \u2013 choosing causes based on how we can accomplish the most good \u2013 we\u2019ve seen a good deal of pushback and skepticism. It\u2019s common for people to emphasize the importance of \u201cstarting from the heart,\u201d and to fear that our commitment to a cause won\u2019t be genuine (and won\u2019t be robust) if it comes from a strategic, analysis-based choice.</p><p>This concern is reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?_r=0\">David Brooks\u2019s reaction to the idea of \u201cearning to give\u201d:</a>\n</p><blockquote>If you choose a profession that doesn\u2019t arouse your everyday passion for the sake of serving instead some abstract faraway good, you might end up as a person who values the far over the near. You might become one of those people who loves humanity in general but not the particular humans immediately around \u2026 Instead of seeing yourself as one person deeply embedded in a particular community, you may end up coolly looking across humanity as a detached god.<p></p><p>\u2026when most people pick a vocation, they don\u2019t only want one that will be externally useful. They want one that they will enjoy, and that will make them a better person. They want to find that place, as the novelist Frederick Buechner put it, \u201cwhere your deep gladness and the world\u2019s deep hunger meet.\u201d</p></blockquote>\nI believe that these concerns misunderstand effective altruism. Effective altruism isn\u2019t an alternative to having personal interests and passions; it <em>is</em> a personal interest and passion. Our next post will elaborate.<p></p><p><em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/13/effective-altruism/\">The GiveWell Blog</a></em></p></div></div>"},
{"date": "28th Jun 2013", "title": "Keeping choices donation neutral", "author": "Jeff_Kaufman", "num_comments": "1 comment", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>Every dollar I spend on myself is a dollar that could go much farther if spent on other people.  I can give someone else a year of healthy life for about $50 [1] and there's no way $50 can do anywhere near that much to help me.  I could go through my life constantly <a href=\"http://www.raikoth.net/deadchild.html\">weighing every purchase</a> against the good it could do, but this would make me miserable.  So how do I accept that other people need my money more without giving up on being happy myself?</p><p>For me the key is to make most choices donation neutral.  As money comes in I divide it into \"money to give to the most effective charity\" and \"money to spend as I wish\".  How to divide it is a hard and distressing choice, but it's one I only have to make once a year. Then when deciding to buy something (socks, rent, phone, instruments, food) I know it's money that isn't getting given away regardless, so I don't have to feel constantly guilty about making tradeoffs with people's lives.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/\">Julia</a> and I have been using this system since 2009. [2] It's mostly worked well, but it's needed some additions.  The main issue is that declining to spend money on yourself isn't the only way to trade off benefits to other people against costs to yourself.  For example you could decide to be vegan, <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2012-06-17\">donate a kidney</a>, or cash out your vacation days and give away the money.  For ones that generate money directly (cashing out vacation) the solution is simple: that money goes into the pool that can't be given away.  For ones that don't generate money you would convert them into money via the good you think they do. Take the most effective charity you know about, figure out how much you would need to give to them in order to have the same positive effect, and then move that amount of money from donations to self-spending.  For example, I might estimate that giving $100 to the AMF does about as much good as being vegan for a year, so if I decided to go ahead with being vegan I would decrease my annual donations by $100 and allocate another $100 to spend on myself.</p><p>I may or may not decide that having another $X to spend on myself is better than sacrifice Y, but whichever way I decide I'm working to make myself as happy as possible for a given amount of doing good. It's not a choice that has additional lives saved weighing on either side of it.</p><p>(This doesn't deal with a potentially important category: things that only make you somewhat unhappy.  For example, working a higher paying job you like less, or pushing yourself to host more <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.meetup.com/\">effective  altruism meetups</a> than you'd really like to.  I don't see how to deal with this, but I don't think it's been a problem so far.)</p><p><br></p><p>[1] Specifically, I can donate to the Against Malaria Foundation, which distributes anti-malarial nets.  The main effect is averting deaths of children who will probably go on to live around 30 years once you take into account other things they might die from.  This comes to about $75 per additional year of life.  There are also many other people protected by the nets where it doesn't make the difference between life and death but helps them live healthier lives.  That brings the $/DALY figure down to\n    about $50.</p><p>[2] I also wrote about this approach <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2010-07-19\">in 2010</a> when it was much younger.</p></div></div>"},

This was part of an attempt to get \u201cin character\u201d. <em>This tone does not indicate my current mental state with regard to the effective altruism movement.</em> I agree, to varying extents, with some of the critiques I present here, but I\u2019m not about to give up on effective altruism or stop cooperating with the EA movement. The apostasy is purely hypothetical.</p><p>Also, because of the nature of a hypothetical apostasy, I\u2019d guess that for effective altruist readers, the critical tone of this piece may be especially likely to trigger defensive rationalization. Please read through with this in mind. (A good way to counteract this effect might be, for instance, to imagine that you\u2019re not an effective altruist, but your friend is, and it\u2019s them reading through it: how should they update their beliefs?)</p><p>(End less relevant paragraphs.)</p><p>Finally, if you\u2019ve never heard of effective altruism before, I don\u2019t recommend making this piece your first impression of it! You\u2019re going to get a very skewed view because I don\u2019t bother to mention all the things that are awesome about the EA movement.\n</p><h2 id=\"Abstract\">Abstract</h2>\nEffective altruism is, to my knowledge, the first time that a substantially useful set of ethics and frameworks to analyze one\u2019s effect on the world has gained a broad enough appeal to resemble a social movement. (I\u2019d say these principles are something like <em>altruism</em>, <em>maximization</em>, <em>egalitarianism</em>, and <em>consequentialism</em>; together they imply many improvements over the social default for trying to do good in the world\u2014earning to give as opposed to doing direct charity work, working in the developing world rather than locally, using evidence and feedback to analyze effectiveness, etc.) Unfortunately, as a movement effective altruism is failing to use these principles to acquire correct nontrivial beliefs about how to improve the world.<p></p><p>By way of clarification, consider a distinction between two senses of the word \u201ctrying\u201d I used above. Let\u2019s call them \u201cactually trying\u201d and \u201cpretending to try\u201d. Pretending to try to improve the world is something like responding to social pressure to improve the world by querying your brain for a thing which improves the world, taking the first search result and rolling with it. For example, for a while I thought that I would try to improve the world by developing computerized methods of checking informally-written proofs, thus allowing more scalable teaching of higher math, democratizing education, etc. <em>Coincidentally</em>, computer programming and higher math happened to be the two things that I was best at. This is pretending to try. Actually trying is looking at the things that improve the world, figuring out which one maximizes utility, and then doing that thing. For instance, I now run an effective altruist student organization at Harvard because I realized that even though I\u2019m a comparatively bad leader and don\u2019t enjoy it very much, it\u2019s still very high-impact if I work hard enough at it. This isn\u2019t to say that I\u2019m actually trying yet, but I\u2019ve gotten closer.</p><p>Using this distinction between pretending and actually trying, I would summarize a lot of effective altruism as \u201cpretending to actually try\u201d. As a social group, effective altruists have successfully noticed the pretending/actually-trying distinction. But they seem to have stopped there, assuming that knowing the difference between fake trying and actually trying translates into ability to actually try. Empirically, it most certainly doesn\u2019t. A lot of effective altruists still end up satisficing\u2014finding actions that are on their face acceptable under core EA standards and then picking those which seem appealing because of other essentially random factors. This is more likely to converge on good actions than what society does by default, because the principles are better than society\u2019s default principles. Nevertheless, it fails to make much progress over what is directly obvious from the core EA principles. As a result, although \u201cdoing effective altruism\u201d feels like truth-seeking, it often ends up being just a more credible way to pretend to try.<a></a></p><p>Below I introduce various ways in which effective altruists have failed to go beyond the social-satisficing algorithm of establishing some credibly acceptable alternatives and then picking among them based on essentially random preferences. I exhibit other areas where the norms of effective altruism fail to guard against motivated cognition. Both of these phenomena add what I call \u201cepistemic inertia\u201d to the effective-altruist consensus: effective altruists become more subject to pressures on their beliefs other than those from a truth-seeking process, meaning that the EA consensus becomes less able to update on new evidence or arguments and preventing the movement from moving forward. I argue that this stems from effective altruists\u2019 reluctance to think through issues of the form \u201cbeing a successful social movement\u201d rather than \u201ccorrectly applying utilitarianism individually\u201d. This could potentially be solved by introducing an additional principle of effective altruism\u2014e.g. \u201cgroup self-awareness\u201d\u2014but it may be too late to add new things to effective altruism\u2019s DNA.\n</p><h2 id=\"Philosophical_difficulties\">Philosophical difficulties</h2>\nThere is <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/protecting-acro.html\">currently</a> <a href=\"http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/ideas/negative-utilitarianism/\">wide</a> <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/hedonistic-vs-preference.html\">disagreement</a> <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/suffering-nature.html\">among</a> <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/91/average_utilitarianism_must_be_correct/\">effective</a> <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/06/03/my-outlook/comment-page-1/#comment-445\">altruists</a> on the correct framework for population ethics. This is crucially important for determining the best way to improve the world: different population ethics can lead to drastically different choices (or at least so we would expect <em>a priori</em>), and if the EA movement can\u2019t converge on at least their instrumental goals, it will quickly fragment and lose its power. Yet there has been little progress towards discovering the correct population ethics (or, from a moral anti-realist standpoint, constructing arguments that will lead to convergence on a particular population ethics), or even determining which ethics lead to which interventions being better.\n<h2 id=\"Poor_cause_choices\">Poor cause choices</h2>\nMany effective altruists donate to <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell\u2019s</a> top charities. All three of these charities work in global health. Is that because GiveWell knows that global health is the highest-leverage cause? No. It\u2019s because it was the only one with enough data to say anything very useful about. There\u2019s little reason to suppose that this correlates with being particularly high-leverage\u2014on the contrary, heuristic but less rigorous arguments for causes like <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/2013/06/05/friendly-ai-research-as-effective-altruism/\">existential risk prevention</a>, <a href=\"http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-vegetarian/\">vegetarian advocacy</a> and <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/open-borders-in-at-least-one-developed.html\">open borders</a> suggest that these could be even more efficient.<p></p><p>Furthermore, the our current \u201cbest known intervention\u201d is likely to change (in a more cost-effective direction) in the future. There are two competing effects here: we might discover better interventions to donate to than the ones we currently think are best, but we also might run out of opportunities for the current best known intervention, and have to switch to the second. So far we seem to be in a regime where the first effect dominates, and there\u2019s no evidence that we\u2019ll reach a tipping point very soon, especially given how new the field of effective charity research is.</p><p>Given these considerations, it\u2019s quite surprising that effective altruists are donating to global health causes now. Even for those looking to use their donations to set an example, a donor-advised fund would have many of the benefits and none of the downsides. And anyway, donating when you believe it\u2019s not (except for example-setting) the best possible course of action, in order to make a point about figuring out the best possible course of action and then doing that thing, seems perverse.\n</p><h2 id=\"Non_obviousness\">Non-obviousness</h2>\nEffective altruists often express surprise that the idea of effective altruism only came about so recently. For instance, my student group recently hosted Elie Hassenfeld for a talk in which he made remarks to that effect, and I\u2019ve heard other people working for EA organizations express the same sentiment. But no one seems to be actually worried about this\u2014just smug that they\u2019ve figured out something that no one else had.<p></p><p>The \u201cmarket\u201d for ideas is at least somewhat efficient: most simple, obvious and correct things get thought of fairly quickly after it\u2019s possible to think them. If a meme as simple as effective altruism hasn\u2019t taken root yet, we should at least try to understand why before throwing our weight behind it. The absence of such attempts\u2014in other words, the fact that non-obviousness doesn\u2019t make effective altruists worried that they\u2019re missing something\u2014is a strong indicator against the \u201ceffective altruists are actually trying\u201d hypothesis.\n</p><h2 id=\"Efficient_markets_for_giving\">Efficient markets for giving</h2>\nIt\u2019s often claimed that \u201cnonprofits are not a market for doing good; they\u2019re a market for warm fuzzies\u201d. This is used as justification for why it\u2019s possible to do immense amounts of good by donating. However, while it\u2019s certainly true that most donors aren\u2019t explicitly trying to purchase utililty, there\u2019s still a lot of money that is.<p></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/\">Gates Foundation</a> is an example of such an organization. They\u2019re effectiveness-minded and with $60 billion behind them. 80,000 Hours has already <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/239-show-me-the-harm\">noted</a> that they\u2019ve probably saved over 6 million lives with their vaccine programs alone\u2014given that they\u2019ve spent a relatively small part of their endowment, they must be getting a much better exchange rate than our current best guesses.</p><p>So why not just donate to the Gates Foundation? Effective altruists need a better account of the \u201cmarket inefficiencies\u201d that they\u2019re exploiting that Gates isn\u2019t. Why didn\u2019t the Gates Foundation fund the <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, GiveWell\u2019s top charity, when it\u2019s in one of their main research areas? It seems implausible that the answer is simple incompetence or the like.</p><p>A general rule of markets is that if you don\u2019t know what your edge is, you\u2019re the sucker. Many effective altruists, when asked what their edge is, give some answer along the lines of \u201cactually being strategic/thinking about utility/caring about results\u201d, and stop thinking there. This isn\u2019t a compelling case: as mentioned before, it\u2019s not clear why no one else is doing these things.\n</p><h2 id=\"Inconsistent_attitude_towards_rigor\">Inconsistent attitude towards rigor</h2>\nEffective altruists insist on extraordinary rigor in their charity recommendations\u2014cf. for instance GiveWell\u2019s work. Yet for many ancillary problems\u2014donating now vs. later, choosing a career, and deciding how \u201cmeta\u201d to go (between direct work, earning to give, doing advocacy, and donating to advocacy), to name a few\u2014they seem happy to choose between the not-obviously-wrong alternatives based on intuition and gut feelings.\n<h2 id=\"Poor_psychological_understanding\">Poor psychological understanding</h2>\nJohn Sturm suggests, and I agree, that many of these issues are psychological in nature:\n<blockquote>I think a lot of these problems take root a commitment level issue:<p></p><p>I, for instance, am thrilled about changing my mentality towards charity, not my mentality towards having kids. My first guess is that - from an EA and overall ethical perspective - it would be a big mistake for me to have kids (even after taking into account the normal EA excuses about doing things for myself). At least right now, though, I just don\u2019t care that I\u2019m ignoring my ethics and EA; I want to have kids and that\u2019s that.</p><p>This is a case in which I\u2019m not \u201cbeing lazy\u201d so much as just not trying at all. But when someone asks me about it, it\u2019s easier for me to give some EA excuse (like that having kids will make me happier and more productive) that I don\u2019t think is true - and then I look like I\u2019m being a lazy or careless altruist rather than not being one at all.</p><p>The model I\u2019m building is this: there are many different areas in life where I could apply EA. In some of them, I\u2019m wholeheartedly willing. In some of them, I\u2019m not willing at all. Then there are two kinds of areas where it looks like I\u2019m being a lazy EA: those where I\u2019m willing and want to be a better EA\u2026 and those where I\u2019m not willing but I\u2019m just pretending (to myself or others or both).</p><p>The point of this: when we ask someone to be a less lazy EA, we are (1) helping them do a better job at something they want to do, and (2) trying to make them either do more than they want to or admit they are \u201cbad\u201d.</p></blockquote>\nIn general, most effective altruists respond to deep conflicts between effective altruism and other goals in one of the following ways:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Unconsciously resolve the cognitive dissonance with motivated reasoning: \u201cit\u2019s clearly my comparative advantage to spread effective altruism through poetry!\u201d</li>\n\t<li>Deliberately and knowingly use motivated reasoning: \u201cdear Facebook group, what are the best utilitarian arguments in favor of becoming an EA poet?\u201d</li>\n\t<li>Take the easiest \u201chonest\u201d way out: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be psychologically able to do effective altruism if it forced me to go into finance instead of writing poetry, so I\u2019ll become an effective altruist poet instead\u201d.</li>\n</ol>\nThe third is debatably defensible\u2014though, for a community that purports to put stock in rationality and self-improvement, effective altruists have shown surprisingly little interest in self-modification to have more altruistic intentions. This seems obviously worthy of further work.<p></p><p>Furthermore, EA norms do not proscribe even the first two, leading to a group norm that doesn\u2019t cause people to notice when they\u2019re engaging in a certain amount of motivated cognition. This is quite toxic to the movement\u2019s ability to converge on the truth. (As before, effective altruists are still better than the general population at this; the core EA principles are strong enough to make people notice the most obvious motivated cognition that obviously runs afoul of them. But that\u2019s not nearly good enough.)\n</p><h2 id=\"Historical_analogues\">Historical analogues</h2>\nWith the partial exception of GiveWell\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/history-of-philanthropy\">history of philanthropy project</a>, there\u2019s been no research into good historical outside views. Although there are no direct precursors of effective altruism (worrying in its own right; see above), there is one notably similar movement: communism, where the idea of \u201cfrom each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\u201d originated. Communism is also notable for its various abject failures. Effective altruists need to be more worried about how they will avoid failures of a similar class\u2014and in general they need to be more aware of the pitfalls, as well as the benefits, of being an increasingly large social movement.<p></p><p>Aaron Tucker elaborates better than I could:\n</p><blockquote>In particular, Communism/Socialism was a movement that was started by philosophers, then continued by technocrats, where they thought reason and planning could make the world much better, and that if they coordinated to take action to fix everything, they could eliminate poverty, disease, etc.<p></p><p>Marx totally got the \u201cactually trying vs. pretending to try\u201d distinction AFAICT (\u201cPhilosophers have only explained the world, but the real problem is to change it\u201d is a quote of his), and he really strongly rails against people who unreflectively try to fix things in ways that make sense to the culture they\u2019re starting from\u2014the problem isn\u2019t that the bourgeoisie aren\u2019t trying to help people, it\u2019s that the only conception of help that the bourgeoisie have is one that\u2019s mostly epiphenomenal to actually improving the lives of the proletariat\u2014giving them nice boureoisie things like education and voting rights, but not doing anything to improve the material condition of their life, or fix the problems of why they don\u2019t have those in the first place, and don\u2019t just make them themselves.</p><p>So if Marx got the pretend/actually try distinction, and his followers took over countries, and they had a ton of awesome technocrats, it seems like it\u2019s the perfect EA thing, and it totally didn\u2019t work.</p></blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"Monoculture\">Monoculture</h2>\nEffective altruists are not very diverse. The vast majority are white, \u201cupper-middle-class\u201d, intellectually and philosophically inclined, from a developed country, etc. (and I think it skews significantly male as well, though I\u2019m less sure of this). And as much as the multiple-perspectives argument for diversity is hackneyed by this point, it seems quite germane, especially when considering e.g. global health interventions, whose beneficiaries are culturally very foreign to us.<p></p><p>Effective altruists are not very humanistically aware either. EA came out of analytic philosophy and spread from there to math and computer science. As such, they are too hasty to dismiss many arguments as moral-relativist postmodernist fluff, e.g. that effective altruists are promoting cultural imperialism by forcing a Westernized conception of \u201cthe good\u201d onto people they\u2019re trying to help. Even if EAs are quite confident that the utilitarian/reductionist/rationalist worldview is correct, the outside view is that really engaging with a greater diversity of opinions is very helpful.\n</p><h2 id=\"Community_problems\">Community problems</h2>\nThe discourse around effective altruism in e.g. the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/\">Facebook group</a> used to be of fairly high quality. But as the movement grows, the traditional venues of discussion are getting inundated with new people who haven\u2019t absorbed the norms of discussion or standards of proof yet. If this is not rectified quickly, the EA community will cease to be useful at all: there will be no venue in which a group truth-seeking process can operate. Yet nobody seems to be aware of the magnitude of this problem. There have been some half-hearted attempts to fix it, but nothing much has come of them.\n<h2 id=\"Movement_building_issues\">Movement building issues</h2>\nThe whole point of having an effective altruism \u201cmovement\u201d is that it\u2019ll be bigger than the sum of its parts. Being organized as a movement should turn effective altruism into the kind of large, semi-monolithic actor that can actually get big stuff done, not just make marginal contributions.<p></p><p>But in practice, large movements and truth-seeking hardly ever go together. As movements grow, they get more \u201cepistemic inertia\u201d: it becomes much harder for them to update on evidence. This is because they have to rely on social methods to propagate their memes rather than truth-seeking behavior. But people who have been drawn to EA by social pressure rather than truth-seeking take much longer to change their beliefs, so once the movement reaches a critical mass of them, it will become difficult for it to update on new evidence. As described above, this is already happening to effective altruism with the ever-less-useful Facebook group.\n</p><h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\nI\u2019ve presented several areas in which the effective altruism movement fails to converge on truth through a combination of the following effects:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Effective altruists \u201cstop thinking\u201d too early and satisfice for \u201cdoesn\u2019t obviously conflict with EA principles\u201d rather than optimizing for \u201cincreases utility\u201d. (For instance, they choose donations poorly due to this effect.)</li>\n\t<li>Effective altruism puts strong demands on its practitioners, and EA group norms do not appropriately guard against motivated cognition to avoid them. (For example, this often causes people to choose bad careers.)</li>\n\t<li>Effective altruists don\u2019t notice important areas to look into, specifically issues related to \u201cbeing a successful movement\u201d rather than \u201ccorrectly implementing utilitarianism\u201d. (For instance, they ignore issues around group epistemology, historical precedents for the movement, movement diversity, etc.)</li>\n</ol>\nThese problems are worrying on their own, but the lack of awareness of them is the real problem. The monoculture is worrying, but the lackadaisical attitude towards it is worse. The lack of rigor is unfortunate, but the fact that people haven\u2019t noticed it is the real problem.<p></p><p>Either effective altruists don\u2019t yet realize that they\u2019re subject to the failure modes of any large movement, or they don\u2019t feel motivation to do the boring legwork of e.g. engaging with viewpoints that your inside view says are annoying but that the outside view says are useful on expectation. Either way, this bespeaks worrying things about the movement\u2019s staying power.</p><p>More importantly, it also indicates an epistemic failure on the part of effective altruists. The fact that no one else within EA has done a substantial critique yet is a huge red flag. If effective altruists aren\u2019t aware of strong critiques of the EA movement, why aren\u2019t they looking for them? This suggests that, contrary to the emphasis on rationality within the movement, many effective altruists\u2019 beliefs are based on social, rather than truth-seeking, behavior.</p><p>If it doesn\u2019t solve these problems, effective-altruism-the-movement won\u2019t help me achieve any more good than I could individually. All it will do is add epistemic inertia, as it takes more effort to shift the EA consensus than to update my individual beliefs.\n</p><h2 id=\"Are_these_problems_solvable_\">Are these problems solvable?</h2>\nIt seems to me that the third issue above (lack of self-awareness as a social movement) subsumes the other two: if effective altruism as a movement were sufficiently introspective, it could probably notice and solve the other two problems, as well as future ones that will undoubtedly crop up.<p></p><p>Hence, I propose an additional principle of effective altruism. In addition to being <em>altruistic</em>, <em>maximizing</em>, <em>egalitarian</em>, and <em>consequentialist</em> we should be <em>self-aware</em>: we should think carefully about the issues associated with being a successful movement, in order to make sure that we can move beyond the obvious applications of EA principles and come up with non-trivially better ways to improve the world.\n</p><h2 id=\"Acknowledgments\">Acknowledgments</h2>\nThanks to <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/\">Nick Bostrom</a> for coining the idea of a hypothetical apostasy, and to <a href=\"http://becomingeden.com/\">Will Eden</a> for <a href=\"http://becomingeden.com/hypothetical-apostasy-on-nutrition/\">mentioning</a> it recently.<p></p><p>Thanks to Michael Vassar, <a href=\"http://philogenic.wordpress.com/\">Aaron Tucker</a> and Andrew Rettek for inspiring various of these points.</p><p>Thanks to Aaron Tucker and John Sturm for reading an advance draft of this post and giving valuable feedback.</p><p><em>Cross-posted from\u00a0</em><a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/ea-critique\">http://www.benkuhn.net/ea-critique</a><em></em></p></div></div>"},

There's a decent case to be made that aiming to do good is one of the best ways of having a career that is personally satisfying. In general, I think that a great research program for practical ethics is to find out what policies or personal activities are in the class of \"win-wins\". That is: what actions or activities can we recommend that, if undertaken, make the actor personally better off and also result in a better outcome for others? (Activities that improve self-control, such as mindfulness meditation, might be in this category.). And what policies can we recommend that both make the home country better off, but also have great benefits for the citizens of other countries? (More relaxed immigration policies might be in this category).</p>\n<p>Promoting these activities is morally important both because they have benefits for the world and because they have a good chance of successfully being taken up. I worry that recommendations in this category are often neglected by practical ethics simply because \"acting morally\" has such strong connotations of self-sacrifice. (It sounds kind of odd to talk of \"the moral imperative to promoting mindfulness meditation\".) But it need not be so. What's good for yourself and what's good for the world are logically independent, and sometimes they overlap in unexpected ways. We should try to find those ways and champion them.</p></div></div>"},

{"date": "1st Oct 2013", "title": "Creating a world with more effective charitable giving", "author": "Eric_Friedman", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>I recently wrote a book, <em>Reinventing Philanthropy: A Framework for More Effective Giving</em>, which has just been released. I hope it is a valuable contribution to the effective altruism movement.</p><p>The genesis of the book stemmed from wondering why the vast majority of charitable giving goes to mediocre causes. It seemed almost self-evident to me that charitable donations should be done in the way that provides the greatest expected benefit for the world. But this clearly isn\u2019t obvious to everyone, as demonstrated by the charitable giving behavior of most donors. If I wanted to influence people to give to more effective causes, I needed to understand the obstacles and directly address them. Some of these obstacles include:</p><p>1. Most people are not honest with themselves about the tension between giving to the causes they are personally connected to and having a high impact. It shouldn\u2019t take much thought to realize that restricting your giving to only a small set of causes\u2014the university you attended, health-related causes that impacted your family, and charities in your neighborhood\u2014is likely to exclude the most high-impact areas. But donors often don\u2019t think like this. They need a resource to help change their mindset.</p><p>2. Most professionals in the nonprofit and philanthropy industry are unwilling to challenge donors to think hard. Society is reluctant to question the current practice that charitable giving is primarily \u201cheart\u201d and very little \u201chead.\u201d The idea of ranking charities by the amount of good they do makes people uncomfortable. They find it awkward to provide criticism of donors, even those who give to mediocre charities; all donors get praised, as they did more good than if they spent the money on themselves. There needs to be open debate about the existing norms of charitable giving in more high-profile forums.</p><p>3. There are few resources for effective altruists. People who want to pursue charitable giving with an EA mindset must carve their own path. The largest charity rating agencies continue to assign scores virtually unrelated to the quality of the charities\u2019 results. There are a very small number of charity evaluators that approach giving with an EA mindset, and those that exist (like GiveWell) are still in their infancy and not well known. If you don\u2019t agree with their approach, then it is excruciatingly difficult to do alternative research yourself. There needs to be more resources to help donors who want to maximize the impact of their giving.</p><p>I thought that writing a book on charitable giving may be able to address each of these issues and break down barriers to improve the effectiveness of charitable giving. My book attempts to provide donors with an honest, authentic perspective on charitable giving to help them understand how their giving decisions affect the impact of their donations. It challenges the norms of giving and provides a more robust way for donors to approach how they decide where to donate money. Hopefully, it will influence readers to want to pursue higher impact strategies and gives them some of the tools to start doing so.</p><p>The first chapter of the book is available for free on <a href=\"http://reinventingphilanthropy.com/excerpt/\">my website</a>.</p></div></div>"},

It\u2019s a simple idea: create an organisation that does nothing except fundraise for GiveWell\u2019s top recommendations. It <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising\">seems relatively easy</a> to raise more than $1 for every $1 invested in fundraising, so it seems relatively easy to act as a multiplier on donations to other charities, and thus create an organisation with a cost-effectiveness ratio that\u2019s higher than the charities themselves.</p>\n\n<p>The idea has merit from other angles too, for instance, <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/92-why-don-t-charities-spend-more-on-fundraising\">there\u2019s reason to expect</a> that charities don\u2019t fundraise as much as would be optimal, and it\u2019s a valuable service to them to take fundraising off their books. It\u2019s also promising because the success of fundraising is relatively easy to quantify compared to many other meta-charity activities (like doing research or advocacy). This means that you can learn quickly whether you\u2019re succeeding, which means you can improve quickly.</p>\n\n<p>We were thrilled, therefore, to find that two 80k members, Joey and Xio, are planning to start an organisation that does exactly this. It\u2019s called <a href=\"http://www.effectivefundraising.net/\">Effective Fundraising</a>. Their plan is to start by writing grants for <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com/\">Against Malaria Foundation</a> (AMF) and <a href=\"http://www.thehumaneleague.com/\">The Humane League</a> for six months. If it goes well, they could hire more people. Longer term, they could expand into others kinds of fundraising. They chose grant writing because (i) surveys of average fundraising ratios found that grant writing earns an average return of around $8 for every $1 invested, which is higher than most other forms of fundraising (ii) the money can be raised within 6-18 months, unlike \u2018chugging\u2019 (asking for donations on the street) or door-to-door which takes several years to pay off.</p>\n\n<p>Joey and Xio sought out a huge amount of advice on their strategy. They\u2019re some of the most altruistic people we know, and recently put college on hold in Canada in order to work on effective altruist start-ups. One of the sources they consulted was 80,000 Hours, and we were very happy to help. Rob Wiblin and I spent several hours thinking about their strategy and several hours discussing with Joey and Xio. (They have also sought advice from the other employees of 80,000 Hours and our President, Will MacAskill).</p>\n\n<p>Joey and Xio were mainly seeking advice on how best to execute the project. In the rest of this post, we outline the main recommendations we made during the course of the discussion. Although our discussions didn\u2019t lead to an immediate change in their plans, we hope this contributes to the discussion that Joey and Xio have been leading on how best to fundraise for top GiveWell recommendations, and inspires others to consider similar ways to make a difference. In summary:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"Summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>We think:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Working on Effective Fundraising looks like a very strong option for building career capital.</li>\n\n<li>They could consider running more experiments before committing to grant-writing for 6 months.</li>\n\n<li>They may be having less impact than they could because they may not be supporting the most high priority causes.</li>\n\n<li>They should strongly consider hiring someone else to work for Effective Fundraising as a grant writer.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"_1__We_agree_that_working_on_Effective_Fundraising_looks_like_a_very_strong_option_for_building_career_capital\">(1) We agree that working on Effective Fundraising looks like a very strong option for building career capital</h3>\n\n<p>By founding their own organisation, we expect them to learn a variety of very useful entrepreneurial skills very rapidly. They should also improve their ability to fundraise, which is a highly useful skill for someone looking to work in the non-profit sector, but also involves sales skills that are useful almost everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>This seems better than the skill development they could have working at another effective altruist organisation, where they would probably be given less responsibility, particularly if they make sure they prioritise learning while running Effective Fundraising (which they are).</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Effective Fundraising offers more long-term upside. If it works, it could grow into large, new organisation within effective altruism.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"_2__They_could_consider_running_more_experiments_before_committing_to_grant_writing_for_6_months_\">(2) They could consider running more experiments before committing to grant-writing for 6 months.</h3>\n\n<p>We both agree that it\u2019s very important to test this project before scaling it up. We place higher weight on this factor than Joey and Xio, because because we think:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There\u2019s a large amount of uncertainty about much money they might expect to raise with different methods</li>\n\n<li>It seems relatively easy to learn more about how much money they might expect to raise by trying out different methods for a couple of months each.</li>\n\n<li>This information would be very valuable, because it could significantly improve how they spend a year of effort, and the information would be valuable to other effective altruists considering the same thing.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Moreover, we think testing grant writing has lower value of information than testing other fundraising, because the feedback is weak.</p>\n\n<p>First, grant writing often has low success ratios. If your base rate of success is only 5%, then you will need to write a lot of grants to measure your ratio. We did a quick analysis, assuming that you have a 50% chance of being as good as professional grant writers (who we modelled as having three levels of ability, based on <a href=\"http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/research/fundratios/\">Institute of Fundraising</a> (IoF) data and assuming a base rate of success of 5%), and a 50% chance of not being able to raise money via grant-writing. We then asked: how many attempts would you have to make before you can be confident that grant writing is better than a guaranteed 3 times pay-off? Assuming a binomial distribution on successes, and performing a bayesian update, we found:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It would take 47 failures in a row to become 90% confident that grant writing is worse</li>\n\n<li>It would take 13 failures in a row for the expected value of grant writing to drop below a guaranteed 3 times return.</li>\n\n<li>On the other hand, 2-3 successes out of the first 5 or so would push grant writing strongly ahead. (You can see the spreadsheet <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuJhoc5Aa_5WdGF2TEpNSVJacFJZeTQ1TkktMGhKSUE#gid=7\">here</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Second, you have to wait 6-12 months to hear the results.</p>\n\n<p>Note that both of these concerns can be mitigated to some extent by starting with easy grants that have close deadlines.</p>\n\n<p>Joey and Xio, however, think that the reasons behind grant writing are sufficiently strong that they should start immediately and do it for six months as a test. In particular they respond:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The uncertainty is less than made out, because there is some data provided by the IoF on the returns of different methods. In particular, the average grant-writer makes 8 times their salary, and the bottom 15% make 5 times their salary. So, even if they perform at the bottom of grant writers, it will be better to do grant-writing than most other forms of fundraising.</li>\n\n<li>It\u2019s harder to experiment than it looks. \u201cYou need licenses to do door-to-door fundraising and street fundraising, and it takes years for you to determine if the recurring donations have a good ratio. Legacies take several years, and sometimes decades to see returns. Both corporate and high net worth donors take considerable time to learn the field and become good at. In 6 months it might be possible to sufficiently test one of these. We think the data, while not as strong as we would like, is enough to show that grant writing is promising, and that it is worth a six to twelve month test.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We note some countervailing considerations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It\u2019s unclear how good the Institute of Fundraising data is, because they don\u2019t publish their methods. For instance, they may not correct for survivorship bias - maybe fundraisers who don\u2019t succeed don\u2019t survive till the end of the year, so don\u2019t appear in the data as collected. We\u2019d also expect the figures to be systematically overstated, because charities have an incentive to keep fundraising costs low, so will try to put fundraising costs under different budget lines (moreover, this seems easier to do with grant writing or high net-worth fundraising than with chugging, because much grant writing is done by managers who have other responsibilities).</li>\n\n<li>The IoF data seems to be <em>the returns earned by people who currently work as grant-writers.</em> Grant-writers who earn less than 5 times their salary lose their jobs very quickly, so the data <em>obviously</em> shows that the ratios are higher than 5 times. This information doesn\u2019t tell us much about how much money Joey and Xio might expect to earn by grant-writing.</li>\n\n<li>There are reasons to expect Joey and Xio will earn less. The average grant-writer is paid over \u00a330,000 per year, which is a professional salary and probably equivalent to something like earning \u00a360,000 in the corporate sector. This suggests that it\u2019s a competitive field. On the other hand, this might be balanced out by the fact that (i) Against Malaria Foundation should be relatively easy to fundraise for (ii) Joey and Xio will prioritise learning and feedback so that they improve at grant writing as quickly as possible.</li>\n\n<li>Even if the licenses for other types of fundraising take several days of full-time work to get, it will still be worth it. Moreover, there seem to be ways to do tests without a license, for instance, you don\u2019t collect payment details and instead just collect pledges for donations and email addresses.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the end, we didn\u2019t reach agreement. Joey and Xio still intend to commit to grant writing, while we suspect it may be better to prioritise experimentation slightly higher.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"_3__They_may_be_having_less_impact_than_they_could_because_they_may_not_be_supporting_the_most_high_priority_causes_\">(3) They may be having less impact than they could because they may not be supporting the most high priority causes.</h3>\n\n<p>We agree that supporting GiveWell recommendations is highly valuable and that the project has an attractive flexibility, since (to some extent) it will be possible to fundraise for different organisations as the evidence changes.</p>\n\n<p>We think, however, that AMF and The Humane League might not be the most promising uses of money currently available, so Joey and Xio might be able to increase expected returns by funding someone else.</p>\n\n<p>Joey and Xio\u2019s response is that: They are a fundraising organization, not a charity evaluation organization. They take top recommendations from Givewell and Effective Animal Activism, two of the most recognized charity evaluators in their respective fields.</p>\n\n<p>We think that going with GiveWell\u2019s recommendations is a reasonable move as it\u2019s plausibly the best charity evaluator in the world, but we also think it\u2019s worth putting more effort into the decision if your aim is really to maximise expected returns.</p>\n\n<p>First, many leading experts both within and outside of effective altruism don\u2019t think that GiveWell\u2019s recommendations clearly offer the best returns. As three examples within global poverty, IPA, AidGrade and Giving What We Can are experts on evidence-based aid, and they don\u2019t fully agree with GiveWell although there is overlap (see <a href=\"http://www.poverty-action.org/provenimpact/testedandproven\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aidgrade.org/uncategorized/some-friendly-concerns-with-givewell\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/recommended-charities\">here</a>). Disagreements are even larger if you also consider charities outside the global poverty cause.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, <em>even GiveWell</em> <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/criteria\">don\u2019t claim</a> that giving to AMF is generically the use of money with the highest expected return. Rather they claim that it\u2019s the best donation opportunity to an existing organisation that\u2019s proven, scalable, has room for more funding and is transparent enough that uninvolved third parties can see that it is. This leaves open the possibility that there are organisations that might be more effective to fund, work for or set up:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Unproven organisations - these could worth investing in (a) to gain information about what works or (b) because they offer high expected return despite low certainty.</li>\n\n<li>Organisations that Joey and Xio have special insight into not available to GiveWell.</li>\n\n<li>Organisations that Joey and Xio could support to gain valuable information about what works that wouldn\u2019t give GiveWell the same level of information.</li>\n\n<li>Small organisations (if room for more funding is less than several hundred thousand dollars, GiveWell won\u2019t normally investigate them, though <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/04/18/challenges-of-passive-funding/\">there are reasons</a> to think many of these opportunities are taken, at least outside of meta-charity style projects).</li>\n\n<li>Organisations that don\u2019t exist yet, but could be created if a donor expressed interest in them or a credible entrepreneur started them. GiveWell has suggested that the approach of strategically picking a cause and then being an <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/04/18/challenges-of-passive-funding/\">active donor</a> could yield better results, at least in some cases.</li>\n\n<li>Organisations that GiveWell hasn\u2019t had time to investigate yet.</li>\n\n<li>Organisations that don\u2019t share GiveWell\u2019s values (e.g. GiveWell doesn\u2019t currently factor animal welfare into their evaluation). Going with GiveWell recommendations means ignoring opportunities to support organisations that fall into these categories, which plausibly contain organisations that are higher impact.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><em>Note that after this post was written, Holden replied (see the comments below), stating that GiveWell does believe that giving to AMF is currently the charitable donation opportunity with the highest expected return, in contraction to the statement above</em></p>\n\n<p>One response could be that making calls like this is difficult, so it\u2019s better just to stick with GiveWell. But Joey and Xio have already decided to funnel 50% of the funds raised to Effective Animal Activism\u2019s top recommendation, which has to date invested far less research time than GiveWell in charity evaluation. It seems inconsistent to overrule GiveWell in this case but not in the other cases.</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, note that if you think that the best opportunities will typically be in these categories, then the idea of Effective Fundraising is slightly less attractive, because opportunities like these are typically difficult to fundraise for as an outsider (and seem easier to support through direct work or earning to give). We think it\u2019s plausible that the best opportunities in these categories will often be more attractive than proven, scalable charities, because (i) value of information is very important because we\u2019re highly uncertain what\u2019s best and opportunities like this offer more information about what works (ii) being an <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/04/18/challenges-of-passive-funding/\">active donor</a> or entrepreneur opens up the space of projects a great deal, which increases the chance finding a good one provided you have a search strategy that\u2019s somewhat effective (iii) <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/05/02/broad-market-efficiency/\">broad market efficiency</a> - if it has already been recognized by GiveWell, then it willl be attracting the attention of some major funders.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"_4__They_should_strongly_consider_hiring_someone_else_to_work_for_Effective_Fundraising_as_a_grant_writer_\">(4) They should strongly consider hiring someone else to work for Effective Fundraising as a grant writer.</h3>\n\n<p>Employing someone to write grants for AMF seems like a good use of money, but it\u2019s something that you don\u2019t need an effective altruist to do. Rather, it might be better to find a grant writer with a track record of several years and ask them to write the grants. This seems more proven and likely to result in higher returns more quickly. The fundraiser could also be paid partially on commission, reducing the downside to Effective Fundraising. This would free Joey and Xio up to work on projects that are less easy to outsource. Or, at least it could help them learn to grant write quicker. I offered to help them raise money to pay for such a person.</p>\n\n<p>Joey and Xio raised some important additional points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It would be difficult to raise the money, especially if they don\u2019t want it to take funds away from effective charities.</li>\n\n<li>It\u2019s too risky - they prefer to trial the project themselves before scaling up.</li>\n\n<li>They\u2019re worried an external fundraiser might not be effectiveness oriented, which would make the organisation less flexible.</li>\n\n<li>They did not feel an external fundraiser, costing three times their combined salary, would likely raise 6 times more per hour than they would.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We agree (1) and (3) are concerns, though don\u2019t seem to sink the idea. Rather, it would be better to make some tests to see if (1) and (3) are true.</p>\n\n<p>(4) is not the relevant comparison. First, what matters is marginal effectiveness not average effectiveness. Even if the extra fundraiser has a lower fundraising ratio, it could still be worth hiring them because it increases the total impact. Second, the ratio of money raised to salary is not what\u2019s relevant from the perspective of maximising impact. Joey and Xio are happy to work on impressively low salaries, which boosts the headline cost-effectiveness of Effective Fundraising, but their opportunity cost also matters. Joey and Xio may have a higher opportunity cost than a fundraiser, because they may have the option to work on another highly effective project.</p>\n\n<p>(2) also doesn\u2019t seem right. If Joey and Xio try to write grants for AMF and fail, then we haven\u2019t learned that Effective Fundraising is a bad idea. Rather, we\u2019ve just learned that Joey and Xio shouldn\u2019t write grants. In this case, it seems like you\u2019d still want to find someone else to try to write grants for AMF. If Joey and Xio try to write grants for AMF and succeed, then they\u2019ll want to hire someone else to scale up. Either way, they\u2019ll want to someone else to be employed as a grant writer, and delaying that process is just slowing down moving money to AMF. Moreover, it seems that it\u2019s less risky to hire a professional with a track record than to do grant writing themselves.</p>\n\n<p>We didn\u2019t reach agreement and Joey and Xio intend to delay hiring another staff member for at least 6 months.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"Further_reading\">Further reading</h2>\n\n<p>If you would like to get involved, <a href=\"http://www.effectivefundraising.net/contact-us.html\">contact Joey and Xio</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to read more about Effective Fundraising, see <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/r/all/lw/i2s/introducing_effective_fundraising_a_new_ea_org/\">this discussion</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can also check out an interview between our trustee Nick Beckstead, Joey and a donor <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/162710548?access_key=key-11juxn1x43fl0i9sm1xp&amp;allow_share=false&amp;show_recommendations=false\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in doing something similar yourself, we\u2019d be interested in <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/get-coaching\">doing a case study on your choice</a>.</p>\n\n<em>Crossposted from the <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/254-case-study-designing-the-world-s-most-effective-charity\">80,000 Hours blog</a></em></div></div>"},

If you'd like to do the same, e-mail me at the usual address or facebook me. This first post is from Eric Friedman, author of Reinventing Philanthropy and long-time GiveWell supporter. -- William MacAskill</em></p><p>When deciding where to give, my starting point is GiveWell\u2019s recommendations.\u00a0 In past years, a majority of my giving has followed GiveWell\u2019s recommendations, but that will be less so this year because of emerging concerns that I have with GiveWell\u2019s approach.\u00a0 I believe GiveWell\u2019s standard of evidence for impact is too high\u2014so high that it is passing over charities that are likely to be higher impact than its recommended charities. <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/process\">GiveWell\u2019s website </a> describes its process as trying to identify opportunities for which they \u201ccould draw a maximally confident, linear, quantified link between donations and outcomes, along the lines of \u2018$X per life saved\u2019\u201d.\u00a0 That is, they are heavily concerned about minimizing the risk of failure.\u00a0 My preferred criteria would allow more risk-taking in order to have the potential to do more good.\u00a0 GiveWell has acknowledged that accepting more risk is likely to open the doors to higher-impact giving opportunities; that is a significant motivation for GiveWell Labs, though there are yet to be any recommendations from GiveWell Labs.</p><p>The four charities I will give to are the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF), Evidence Action (the parent organization of Deworm the World), UNICEF, and GiveWell.\u00a0 The remainder of this post details why I\u2019m giving to each of the organizations I give to as well as why I am not funding GiveDirectly.</p><p>AMF was GiveWell\u2019s favorite charity last year.\u00a0 My understanding is that GiveWell removed AMF from its recommendations largely because of a small, though non-trivial probability of not being able to utilize its cash reserves for a mosquito net distribution.\u00a0 Because of how strongly GiveWell has favored AMF in the past, giving to AMF seems likely to have significantly greater impact than SCI and GiveDirectly, but with a slightly larger probability of failure.\u00a0 I\u2019m willing to accept that (as is <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-12-12/why-we-continue-to-recommend-the-against-malaria-foundation\">Giving What We Can</a>).</p><p>Evidence Action is the parent organization for Deworm the World and Dispensers for Safe Water; only the first of those two is recommended by GiveWell.\u00a0 Evidence Action is an off-shoot of Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), which specializes in doing randomized controlled trials to discover what works to help the world\u2019s poor.\u00a0 IPA does much of the research that GiveWell relies on\u2014even being involved with the research on GiveDirectly.\u00a0 IPA are experts in developmental research and test numerous programs, so I assign a lot of credibility to their putting Dispensers for Safe Water out for expansion.</p><p>GiveWell seemed less excited about the evidence for <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/water-quality\">Dispensers for Safe Water</a>, questioning the robustness of the studies evaluating it.\u00a0 That\u2019s a reasonable view, but I\u2019m excited about the possibility of expanding the intervention <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/from_proof_to_impact\">as a way to get more evidence</a>.\u00a0 It might be the next big proven solution, and I view it as a high priority to find out.\u00a0 Evidence Action\u2019s management team is clearly excited about testing and proving programs, as demonstrated by their affiliation with Innovations for Poverty Action, GiveWell\u2019s observations about their Deworm the World Program, and some of their own statements.\u00a0 So I plan to donate to Evidence Action, unrestricted, and allow them to use the funds for either of their programs\u2014wherever they think it is needed most.</p><p>UNICEF is different from GiveWell\u2019s recommended charities, which almost always focus on only a single intervention.\u00a0 GiveWell has expressed several concerns with mega-charities such as <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/28/mega-charities/\">UNICEF</a>, most notably that \u201cthey engage in a wide variety of activities, and we can\u2019t get a concrete sense of (a) the specifics of the activities; (b) the organization-wide track record; (c) likely uses of additional funding.\u201d\u00a0 I share that concern.\u00a0 In UNICEF\u2019s case, <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/parmo/files/RR_REPORT_2012_NY_FINAL_DOUBLEPAGE.pdf\">68% of their 2012 revenue was restricted</a>, so it is not possible to look at their current activities and understand what they view as priorities or what they would do with additional unrestricted gifts.\u00a0 However, UNICEF has advantages over organizations that focus on a single program, and these should not be ignored.\u00a0 For example, there is value to having a lot of experience working in the developing world and having permanent in-country staff.\u00a0 Ironically, this value can be seen through AMF\u2019s weaknesses; GiveWell removed AMF from its recommendations because of AMF\u2019s inability to finalize a large net distribution, which GiveWell attributes to a communication style that put off potential partners and a lack of in-person communication.\u00a0 UNICEF is much less likely to have that type of problem.</p><p>In addition, UNICEF is a key implementer of several of the proven cost-effective interventions that GiveWell has had difficulty finding <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/03/21/trying-and-failing-to-find-more-funding-gaps-for-delivering-proven-cost-effective-interventions/\">room for more funding </a>for, including being the world\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/parmo/66662_66850.html\">largest purchaser of vaccines</a>.\u00a0 UNICEF\u2019s track record includes a number of programs that likely have higher impact than GiveWell\u2019s top recommendations.\u00a0 I view that as a sign about UNICEF\u2019s values and capabilities.\u00a0 If GiveWell is right about their room for more finding, my donation to UNICEF may not directly increase the scale of these programs.\u00a0 However, I believe there is significant value to giving them unrestricted support, which might be used to maintain their capabilities or expand other programs they view as priorities.\u00a0 Nevertheless, some of UNICEF\u2019s programs are not in areas I view as priorities; I don\u2019t know to what extent that is because of restricted grants versus UNICEF\u2019s decisions.\u00a0 I wish I had more visibility into this, but that\u2019s a risk I\u2019m willing to take.</p><p>GiveDirectly is absent from the list of charities I\u2019m donating to, though it is the <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/03/good-ventures-matching-gift-to-givedirectly-and-grants-to-top-charities/\">favored charity of Good Ventures</a> as well as most of <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/12/staff-members-personal-donations/\">GiveWell\u2019s staff</a>.\u00a0 <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly\">GiveWell describes GiveDirectly\u2019s </a>intervention as having \u201can unusually low burden of proof.\u201d\u00a0 Even GiveWell seems to state that GiveDirectly is probably less cost-effective than its other recommended charities.\u00a0 <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/01/givewells-top-charities-for-giving-season-2013/\">The suggested upside of GiveDirectly</a> is that it will \u201cimprove the aid community\u2019s understanding of, and interest in, cash transfer programs.\u201d This seems to be a preference for strong evidence of impact over evidence of strong impact.\u00a0 I\u2019m more excited about discovering, testing and promoting interventions with evidence of stronger impact.</p><p>After writing all that, it may be surprising that I\u2019m still going to donate to GiveWell.\u00a0 I still believe they have a very strong team and are an extremely important resource for the giving community.\u00a0 Even when I don\u2019t take their recommendations, the knowledge I gained from them has improved my giving.\u00a0 GiveWell Labs will loosen the requirements for evidence, which I look forward to.\u00a0 I also hope GiveWell will adjust its criteria for traditional charity recommendations to better balance the desires for high impact and robust evidence.\u00a0 Transparency and evidence is a good thing, but I believe GiveWell has emphasized these characteristics too much, to the exclusion of other important factors.</p><p><i>Eric Friedman is the author of </i>Reinventing Philanthropy: A Framework for More Effective Giving<i>.

But for now, I think there is a much more compelling reason to save: there is a very good chance that the best giving opportunities we can identify in the near future will be better than the best giving opportunities we can identify this year.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>The basic reason for optimism is that only a very small fraction of all existing charitable opportunities\u2014much less all possible altruistic interventions\u2014have been rigorously assessed. Activities like political advocacy and differential tech development seem like they could easily have very large impacts, but at the moment those impacts are poorly understood. So today we have a choice between focusing on relatively simple, well-understood interventions, or going out on a limb and supporting more speculative work.</p>\n<p>The speculative projects seem like they probably have much larger impact, but speculative projects probably vary greatly in their cost-effectiveness in ways we don\u2019t yet understand: in those areas we do understand, we observe large gaps between the most and least effective interventions which are often hard to notice without more detailed analysis, and it seems likely that similar gaps will exist in harder-to-quantify areas. So at the moment it seems like we will be able to do much more with our money in the future.</p>\n<p>This situation should be familiar to many donors, and especially to \u201ceffective altruists\u201d: our <em>current</em> best guesses (in most cases) are not only different from our past best guesses, they are also likely to be several times more cost-effective.</p>\n<p>There are many positive effects from giving now, via enhancing the credibility and coherence of effective altruism (EA) as a movement, increasing the reach of effective altruist organizations. My current view is that the gains to giving now are significant and in many cases dominate the direct impacts; however, because the cost of giving large amounts now is so high it is very valuable to explore alternatives that can produce similar amounts of value without being so wasteful. I suspect that appropriate arrangements involving large EA donor-advised funds would be able to capture many of these gains.</p>\n<p>An even more important consideration is that if we all stopped giving we would mostly stop learning as well\u2014most things we learn comes from our current activities, rather than the passage of time itself. However, a small fraction of activities today seem to be responsible for much of the learning, and so I believe that the great majority of giving by effective altruists could be better spent either on activities better designed to help learn or on saving for the future. If learning is the main goal of giving, then you should be engaged in a different kind of cost-benefit analysis, and you are much more likely to support research and exploratory projects than scaling up proven health interventions (though there are also challenges to scaling up proven interventions which are important to learn more about).</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to lay out the case for giving later in great detail here, because I think most readers will already believe it. Instead I will look at the most compelling reasons to give now anyway, and explain my response to these considerations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The_credibility_of_the_effective_altruism_movement_depends_on_giving_now\">The credibility of the effective altruism movement depends on giving now</h2>\n<p>Through the growth of organizations like GiveWell, 80.000 hours, and Giving What We Can, it is clear that there is a growing contingent of donors who are willing to direct their donations according to considerations of effectiveness. The fact that the community actually does donate is important, for a number of reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It increases the credibility, coherence, and influence of the community itself. I have only a weak idea of what it means to be a \u201crationalist,\u201d but donating significant amounts to cost-effective charities is a costly signal of \u201ceffective altruism.\u201d It grounds the community and reduces the probability that it will lose its focus or direction. Moreover, it significantly increases the external credibility of the movement and makes participation more respectable and attractive. It also increases the persuasiveness of the movement\u2019s ideas, and the ability of people within the movement to influence funders.</li>\n<li>It increases the access of effective altruists to charities. If GiveWell moved $100,000 a year, few charities would want to deal with them or go through the effort to become extremely transparent about their own effectiveness (unless they were intrinsically motivated to do so). If GiveWell moves $10M a year, the situation is different.</li>\n<li>It increases the perceived demand for effective charities. Some causes may be particularly interesting to effective altruists while being relatively unattractive to normal donors. Those causes face a chicken-and-egg problem: until charities are doing work on them there is little evidence for their impact and so EAs don\u2019t want to donate, and until EAs are donating to those causes or similar ones, would-be charities are discouraged by the lack of available funding and so must court a more mainstream audience. If the effective altruism movement is currently directing millions of dollars to our current best guesses and being transparent about what exactly they are looking for, this may help us get out of the chicken-and-egg situation by making it clear there is a large pot of money which is supporting the most demonstrably-cost effective interventions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I think each of these considerations is significant on its own, and taken together they are definitely a big deal. But I am not convinced that giving now is necessary in order to realize these benefits. In particular, I think that an appropriately organized donor-advised fund (DAF) could capture many or most of them. Giving to a charity that is 1/10 as effective as what you expect to find in 10 years is only marginally better than wasting money altogether, and so it seems like a relatively high priority to figure out how to capture these benefits while giving later.</p>\n<p>There are a number of ways that EA DAFs might be organized; here are three that seem to me like they might be able to capture a significant fraction of the total value of giving now:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Directly under the control of EA organizations, such as GiveWell or Giving What We Can, which have missions statements and track records that make it clear that they will give to demonstrably cost-effective charities.</li>\n<li>Under the supervision and perhaps nominal control of EA organizations, such that grant-making is still at donor\u2019s discretion but there is moderate social and logistical pressure to make donations to demonstrably cost-effective charities (particularly those which receive broad support within the EA community, or those backed by strong cost-effectiveness estimates)</li>\n<li>Under the control of individual donors, but (1) loosely affiliated with the EA community via some explicit arrangement such as pledging or registering, and (2) periodically making small grants which indicate the nature of the donor\u2019s interests.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Effect on credibility, coherence, etc. of the EA movement: </strong>Any of these options would probably work to increase the coherence of effective altruism (and establish habits of giving, signal commitment to altruism, etc.) There are disadvantages to such indirect schemes, but if anything a large community of donors publicly setting up donor-advised funds and investing in the search for more cost-effective giving appears to be <em>more</em> distinctive (and more easily justified) than a community giving to their current best guesses. In terms of appeal to normal folk who might consider affiliating with the EA movement, giving later appeals to a very different audience than giving to the developing world now (which is smaller but more likely to pursue higher-impact interventions discovered down the line). Depending on which of these audiences is more valuable, the difference could be a significant cost to completely switching from giving now to giving later. But I think that at a minimum redirecting a large share of funding to giving later would make the movement attractive to a broader range of people.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect on EA organizations: </strong>These options have quite different effects on the influence and prestige of effective altruist organizations. Option 1 may well have a larger positive impact than recommendation-based giving. Option 2 seems to be more nebulous, and I don\u2019t know whether the effect would be larger or smaller (it would probably be sensitive to details of the arrangement). Option 3 would have a smaller impact on the credibility of EA organizations; it would be significantly larger than the effect of e.g. pledges for <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us\">Giving What We Can</a>, but probably significantly smaller than the impact of actual donations. Funds which are publicly committed to the recommendations of a particular organization might have a large effect on that organization\u2019s credibility, but if the commitment is over a longer timescale than most fundraising charities are concerned with (which seems to be relatively short) then this effect would be muted.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect on perceived demand for effective charities: </strong>If relatively well-planned and backed by a larger effective altruism movement, I think that any of these proposals would have a large effect on the perceived demand for efficient charities. As above, the primary difficulty is that funders might be willing to let funds sit for decades, while fundraisers are not really concerned with the demand for effective charities in 20 years. For charities which are not plausibly top recommendations for effective altruists this may not be a huge deal; the biggest concern is if there is ambiguity over whether <em>any</em> opportunity could earn this designation in a realistic timeframe. Periodic small grants would help this issue somewhat,</p>\n<h2 id=\"Learning_depends_on_giving_now\">Learning depends on giving now</h2>\n<p>I think the most important impact of giving now is probably that it accelerates the process of learning. At the level of the EA movement, the main reason to be optimistic about better giving opportunities emerging in the future is that we will actively seek out such opportunities, and discover through experience what directions are most fruitful to explore. (As an individual you can expect your money to go further if you wait and do nothing, but only because you can benefit from the work of others.)</p>\n<p>However, I think that <em>most</em> causes that EAs currently donate to are not responsible for this learning, except indirectly for the reasons explored in the last section (e.g., giving to AMF is not a cost-effective way of learning in and of itself, but may facilitate GiveWell\u2019s other activities, which <em>are</em> a big driver of current learning). A relatively small set of activities seems to be responsible for most learning that is occurring (for example, much of GiveWell\u2019s work, some work within the <a href=\"http://home.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">Centre for Effective Altruism</a>, some strategy work within <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/\">MIRI</a>, hopefully parts of this blog, and a great number of other activities that can\u2019t be so easily sliced up). The argument I\u2019ve given definitely <em>doesn\u2019t</em> justify delaying any of this funding: I\u2019m recommending delaying object-level do-gooding <em>relative</em> to learning, not delaying do-gooding altogether.</p>\n<p>However, it may be that some of these activities produce info much more efficiently than others, and depending on the relative importance of funding and haste it may be worthwhile to stall some of these activities while the most important info-gathering proceeds. To me it currently looks like the value of getting information faster is significantly higher than the value of money, and on the current margin I think most of these learning activities are underfunded. A more serious concern is that there seems to currently be a significant deficit of human capital specialized for this problem and willing to work on it (without already being committed to work on it), so barring some new recruitment strategies (e.g. paying market wages for non-EAs to do EA strategy research) there are significant issues with room for more funding.</p>\n<p>These issues seem important to me, and I\u2019ll certainly return to them in future posts. For now, I\u2019d leave it at: a small fraction of activities EAs fund are directly producing relevant info, and those are probably important and worth scaling up. However, the majority of EA funding does not fall into this category.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Some_activities_have_very_high_returns\">Some activities have very high returns</h2>\n<p>The final compelling reason to fund work now, despite expecting better interventions to be available in the future, is that some activities have very high rates of return. In general I am <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/03/12/giving-now-vs-later/\">quite skeptical</a> about most such claims. But I know of two plausible cases for interventions that have high enough discount rates to justify early spending (I have looked at many other possibilities but haven\u2019t conducted an exhaustive inquiry):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Outreach and movement building</strong>. See <a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a>, <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80.000 Hours</a>, and the <a href=\"http://rationality.org/\">Center for Applied Rationality</a>. It seems plausible that investments in outreach can speed up the growth of some of these movements, hastening the point where they are saturated in the population. If these movements are currently quite small compared to their long-term potential, such speed-ups could result in large multipliers on effort invested today. Moreover, these movements might produce human and financial capital which can be used in the medium-term for learning. So even if the returns to these interventions are only severalfold, they could still be justified as an indirect way of learning more. My main concern with movement building is that the communities they produce may end up not be useful for exploring new interventions, either because the values or intellectual standards of these communities decline, because they irrevocably specialize in order to grow, or because they are not able to inspire very many strong researchers who would not otherwise have been interested.<i><br>\n</i></li>\n<li><strong>Research on impacts of artificial intelligence</strong>. See <a href=\"http://intelligence.org\">MIRI</a>. It looks like a transition to machine intelligence will very likely occur sometime in the next few centuries, and the transition itself may be quite disruptive. I think there is room for valuable work understanding what such a transition might look like and understanding how to influence it. Because there is a modest probability of a surprising transition relatively soon, it might be worth engaging in this project now even without a reliable estimate of its impact. This is especially true if we expect philanthropists of 30 years from now to more reliably pursue high-impact interventions, so that there will be fewer good opportunities in the future.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although both of these activities could have very high returns and so could in principle be worth supporting <em>instead</em> of learning more, I don\u2019t think this is a realistic position. Instead, I consider [1] a potentially efficient way to accelerate learning, and expect that most of the value from movement building comes from the possibility of setting up a community which can learn much faster. I think the most valuable parts of [2] are targeted strategy work which will shed light on the overall landscape and help us learn whether it is worth investing much more heavily in research on AI impacts. That is, although in both of these cases there is potentially high-impact object-level work, there are analogous high-impact approaches to learning, and so that remains the most important output.</p>\n\n<em>Crossposted from <a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/06/10/the-best-reason-to-give-later/\">Rational Altruist</a></em></div></div>"},
{"date": "12th Mar 2013", "title": "Giving now vs. later", "author": "Paul_Christiano", "num_comments": "No comments", "content": "<div class=\"PostsPage-postContent\"><div><p>It has been observed that money spent helping the poor compounds over time in the same way that profit-oriented investments do (see <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/22/more-thoughts-on-responsible-investing/\">Holden Karnofsky</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/frequently-asked-questions#giveasyouearn\">Giving What We Can</a>). When I support the world\u2019s poorest people I\u2019m not just alleviating their suffering, I\u2019m increasing the productivity of their lives. The recipients of aid go on to contribute to the world, and their contributions compound in turn.</p>\n<p>Moreover, one can <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers#Whatreturnoninvestmentdocashtransferrecipientsearn\">argue</a> that the returns to aid are much higher than achievable financial returns. Equities make around 5% in real terms, while the world\u2019s poorest earn returns upwards of 20%. And that\u2019s not surprising\u2014more people are interested in making money than are interested in improving the world, so we should expect it to be harder to find opportunities to make money than opportunities to improve the world.</p>\n<p>So, the argument goes, altruists ought to donate as quickly as possible, doing good works that will compound out there in the world much faster than they will compound in their bank accounts. Make sense?</p>\n<p>I think this argument is mistaken.<span></span></p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the problem: if you give your money well, it might compound much faster than it would have in your bank account\u2014but only for a while. Over time the positive effects will spread out more and more, across a broader and broader group of beneficiaries, until eventually you are just contributing to a representative basket of all human activities. Eventually, my investment will compound at the rate of world economic growth, rather than at the particularly promising interest rate I was able to originally identify.</p>\n<p>When I leave money in my bank account, it compounds slightly (1-2%, conservatively) <i>faster</i> than world economic growth. It does this for years, until I decide to spend it, for example on developing world aid. At that point it will earn anomalously high returns for a while, before being spread out throughout the world and then compounding in line with world economic growth. If I donate a year later, I earn 1 <i>extra</i> year of market returns, and 1 <i>less</i> year of compounding in line with economic growth. That\u2019s a good deal\u2014an extra 1-2%.</p>\n<p>What I really care about is the extra multiplier I get right after I donate my money, before it resumes compounding at the usual rate. E.g., if my investment compounds 5% faster than economic growth for 15 years, my money is being effectively doubled, when compared to an investment that compounded with growth all along. That multiplier isn\u2019t changing a lot over time (it might increase or decrease as good charitable opportunities arise or dry up, but there\u2019s no good a priori reason to expect it to decrease steadily with time).</p>\n<p>So if I\u2019m considering donating to a cause like developing world aid, I shouldn\u2019t donate sooner rather than later just because poor folks can earn higher returns than I can. I should instead look at the total multiplier I\u2019m getting on my money, and donate iff I expect that multiplier is <i>declining</i> faster than [(market rates of return) - (economic growth)]. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve found many causes for which this is plausibly the case, and I think that aid is definitely not one of them.</p>\n<p>The basic issue is that philanthropists <i>aren\u2019t</i> much less selfish than normal people, instrumentally. Even if you care about other people, you would much prefer that you make $1 than that someone else make $2, since when you make $1 you can use it to create more than $2 of value. (Of course this wouldn\u2019t be true in a world with many altruists, in which the returns to altruistic endeavors were less fantastic.)</p>\n<p>In the very long run I expect interest rates to fall / growth rates to rise until the two are equal, and I expect the multiplier on altruistic investments to decrease until it\u2019s 1. But those events look to be a long way off.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Is_giving_later_really_an_option_\"><b>Is giving later really an option?</b></h2>\n<p>There are at least four other reasons to give now rather than later:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Giving can send a social signal, which is useful for encouraging more giving, building communities, demonstrating our generosity, and coordinating with charities. (Who are more likely to take a community of donors seriously than a community of people saying \u201cmaybe we\u2019ll donate in the future.)</li>\n<li>Our priorities may change over time, and we would prefer that our future selves not have the option to keep money for themselves.</li>\n<li>Eventually we will die, and it is very hard to build institutions which will carry out our mission after our death.</li>\n<li>Taxes favor giving as you earn. (You can only deduct donations against this year\u2019s income, and in the US at least you can only deduct 50% of your income in this way, so someone looking to donate a large fraction of their income will be deduction-opportunity-limited, and will want to use up all of the available deductions each year.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I believe that these are serious considerations. However, \u201cgive now\u201d is just one possible solution to these challenges, and if \u201cgive later\u201d would otherwise be a much better strategy, it is worth searching for alternative solutions. Moreover, I expect that I\u2019ll have a much better idea of how to spend charitable dollars in the future. So I would like to hold on to my money even if it weren\u2019t earning interest, and I would need to confront these problems anyway.</p>\n<p>Donor advised funds, or more generally donating to 501(c)3\u2032s which invest, may resolve some of these problems. Giving to a DAF serves as a binding commitment to give, and therefore overcomes problem 2 and some of problem 1. Contributions to DAFs have the same tax status as donations, so overcome problem 4. Potentially the existence of such funds could also facilitate community-building and coordination with charities, perhaps even more effectively than an established record of giving.</p>\n<p>At the moment donor advised funds typically charge management fees of about 0.6% / year on top of normal management fees, and tend to place more restrictions on grants than are legally mandated. In principle, it seems that US charities are free to invest arbitrarily (and  subsume arbitrary for-profit enterprises), and use investment income to finance their activities or make grants.</p>\n<p>It is tempting to imagine a charitable fund designed to accommodate very long-term giving, organized as a 501(c)3 and not charging significant annual management fees. Such a fund might seek out philosophically aligned donors and adopt a governance structure which codifies their shared values (representing a more credible commitment to to the charities that might want to coordinate with those donors). It might go further and actively manage its funds, hiring philosophically aligned traders and analysts, who would be happier to see the surplus they create split between themselves and philanthropists with similar values. I don\u2019t know whether this is possible, but it seems worth thinking about.</p>\n<p>Problem 3 appears to be significantly more difficult, but might be addressed in part by the same mechanisms. Donor advised funds provide a legal framework in which donated funds can be preserved without suffering from estate taxes or the mandated 5% payout of foundations. If there were enough like-minded philanthropists, it may be possible to allow each philanthropist to pass of advisory control of their funds to a like-minded successor before they became unable to oversee them themselves. Making such a fund stable enough to resist gradual value drift or pillaging would be a significant challenge.</p>\n<p>The historical record is conspicuously devoid of successful enterprises of this kind, which suggests that future outings in this genre are doomed to fail. But I don\u2019t think this is such strong evidence:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I know of few serious attempts to create institutions which would build up wealth while resisting value drift or collapse. Today may be special just because today we think of different plans than our ancestors thought of.</li>\n<li>We have access to more effective communication/coordination mechanisms than were available historically. It may now be possible to reliably identify a like-minded and similarly able successor who shares your values even if the social prevalence of those values is one in a million or lower.</li>\n<li>I think there is a reasonable probability that we are in an unprecedentedly stable legal and political regime which will last longer than any preceding regime. Moreover, we now have a global political infrastructure which lets us build financial entities that can survive changes or collapse in one country by moving to another.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So if \u201cgive <i>much</i> later\u201d looks like a good strategy, I think we should seriously consider trying to make it work, rather than throwing up our hands and saying \u201cat least we can get <i>some</i> value by giving now.\u201d</p>\n<h2 id=\"Can_good_works_grow_faster_than_the_world_around_them_\"><b>Can good works grow faster than the world around them?</b></h2>\n<p>The argument above is based on an empirical claim: good deeds tend to grow at the same speed as the world at large, rather than growing much faster. Equivalently: measured as a <i>fraction</i> of the world, the positive changes we effect don\u2019t continue growing indefinitely. (While money in your bank account steadily increases as a fraction of the world\u2019s wealth.) For some interventions, like existential risk reduction or undirected economic boosts, this is true almost definitionally (and I consider risk reduction an unusually <i>forward-looking</i> strategy, rather than unusually short-sighted).</p>\n<p>Something that compounds faster than economic growth necessarily represents an increasing fraction of the world, and if it continues compounding faster than economic growth for long enough it will eventually make up a large fraction of the world and single-handedly increase the growth rates. This is rarely realistic for the kinds of investments we consider.</p>\n<p>Instead, what happens is that the returns from an investment are typically not that concentrated. If I improve the educational system, this may make the world significantly better, but very little of that improvement will occur within the educational system itself. Instead, that improvement will be scattered out across many different endeavors (which will in turn spread their outputs even more widely). Even if the returns to education are very large, they will eventually spread out through society and compound at the usual rate <i>unless</i> the product [(returns to education) times (fraction of returns that are reinvested in education)] exceeds the economic growth rate.</p>\n<p>In general, for a class X of investments to compound faster than economic growth rate, it would need to be the case that [(returns to X) times (fraction of returns reinvested in X)] exceeds the growth rate. If X is a small or very specialized class of investments (like education), it is hard for \u201cfraction of returns reinvested in X\u201d to be large. If X is a large natural class of investments (like the economy of the US), it is hard for \u201creturns to X\u201d to be far above market returns.</p>\n<p>Investment seems to have anomalously good internal returns. I think this is possible because someone is actively applying significant effort to ensure that the returns from one opportunity are reinvested exclusively in the most promising opportunities (and a lot of effort has gone into building the legal and economic infrastructure that can support this). The same thing applies within a firm, although usually firms eventually encounter diminishing returns and their growth slows or stops.</p>\n<p>Even so, the above argument implies that it is impossible for an investor to earn market returns for too long (or else they would eventually have all of the money). In practice, investors are able to earn market returns while they invest, but eventually they take their money out of the market or die, and they do not form lasting lineages of investors.</p>\n<p>There may be other opportunities that have the same important properties as investment. For example, I might be able to efficiently support individuals or organizations that share my values, and therefore might be able to pursue other high-return investments after they have used up their own capacity for growth.
